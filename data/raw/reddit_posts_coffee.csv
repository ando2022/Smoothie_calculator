1mvgkb3,loseit,"My guide to lose weight, no hidden sales, no links, just a long thread on how I lose weight","First and foremost.. I am not a doctor, trainer, nutritionist, nothing of the sort so I do not want to argue about my strategies, about macros, about this or about that. If I can help one person then my goal is complete . It may not be for everyone but it worked for me!

So with that said let’s crack in. I’m a 35 year old male who had always been in athletic shape. Played d1 golf and division 2 high school athletics . A little less than average height around 5’8 with a compact broad structure. I always hovered around 155-165 , that’s when I felt most “ripped” … in my 30s I started to care less about my body and got up to 210 pounds. That’s heavy for me, the classic big gut feeling sluggish so I finally had enough and wanted to do something about it and this is what I did. I’m going to explain the little details because I think that’s what’s most important

I started my new routine with a 48 hour fast. You don’t have to, but I wanted to shock my body and be in a hard calorie deficit going into a daily calorie deficit of eating if that makes sense

1. I held myself accountable, if you don’t you will inevitably fail. Let’s face it, eating food that taste great but packs on pounds is a lot easier and funner(is this a word lol) than restrictive eating and working out.

2. I live a busy life - meal prep and cooking aren’t my strengths but I found ways around that. I weighed everything, kept it right on my kitchen counter. 

3. I told myself every day “I’m going to the gym” even on days I didn’t want to. And believe it or not I ALWAYS felt better after going. 

4. Start with something, anything .. this is a long game not a short fix. I don’t know your situation so make it work. Be deliberate in your intentions. 

5. The food:

Breakfast:
1 scoop whey protein 
2-4 oz Unsweetened vanilla almond milk 
8-10 oz Starbucks medium roast iced coffee . Purchased at local grocery store 

1 nonfat market basket brand (that’s the local grocery in my state) plain Greek yogurt 
Mixed in 1 serving of Jif peanut butter.

I bought the whey protein at a vitamin shop. I buy the coffee and almond milk at the grocery store
I buy the 1 serving cups of the Greek nonfat instead of the bigger container. I buy 7 a week, one a day boom it’s quick. I weigh out the peanut butter every morning 

Lunch:
5 ounces of COOKED skinless boneless chicken breast 

1 cup of minute brown rice. Probably not the best option because of sodium but for me the convenience factor outweighs minimal gain nutritionally . Pop it in the microwave boom ready to go. They sell them in packs of 2 at my grocery store. I buy 4 packs at a time , one for every day

Dinner:
5 ounces of COOKED skinless boneless chicken breast 

100 gram romaine lettuce. I don’t include tomato’s, cucumbers etc purely for quickness and convenience . 

30  ml ranch dressing 

I will also sub out chicken here and there for 85% lean ground beef, sirloin steak, salmon etc. I do it in 5oz servings, found that’s the sweet spot for me

Snack:
One Quaker rice crisp caramel 

I only drank water, seltzer waters, 0 calorie Powerade , Diet Coke during the week. No sugary drinks. I don’t care about what ppl say about artificial sweeteners . My life my body, I enjoy Diet Coke, it doesn’t hinder me that much 

I live a social lifestyle. I will stick to this Monday thru Thursday religiously . Friday and Saturday nights I will “loosen” up and ALLOW myself one meal whatever I want whether it’s a breakfast outing w friends or a dinner w family. I will drink Tito’s and soda without counting on the weekends,  I simply don’t care that much , I will have my fun and enjoy my life . The other meals stick to the plan 

This plan is a little high in fat, very calorie restrictive and hard to stick to, but it works for me. I hit my protein goals, keep carbs down and am in a wicked calorie deficit. 

You’re gonna feel hungry. Fight thru it, that’s a good sign. Means your body’s eating fat for energy.

The point is - it’s a plan , I stick to it. Make a plan stick to yours . 

The work outs:

Tailor it to yourself. Find what distances / weight works for you but this is what I do

I google mapped a spot where I can safely and legally park my car 1.5 miles away from my home gym. I park my car , walk 1.5 miles to the gym, workout, walk back 1.5 miles to the car and go home.

I do this because I HATE treadmills, stair masters etc. I find I pass the time much quicker walking in real life.

If you can’t walk far. Do this set a timer on your phone. I don’t care if it’s 5 minutes. Walk 5 min away from your house when it goes off, walk back home. Add a minute every other day. Build routine, get the body moving. Watch your YouTube content on your walk instead of on your couch. 
Between the 3 miles to and from gym and my work activity I’m in the 15k steps a day range.

The work outs :

Back and biceps
Chest and triceps
Legs
Shoulders and traps
Core 

Go online. Research 3 exercises for your back, 3 exercises for your biceps . Start with a weight that you can do 10 reps EASY im talking so EASY. Just get in the damn gym. The next time you’re scheduled to do back and biceps go up in weight.keep doing this until it becomes very difficult to get 10, then go up one more and only do 5. Once you get to this point find weights that are challenging for 8 reps and red line yourself to get 8 achieved 

Do the basic 3x8-10 failure on the last 2 reps

Rinse and repeat  go online etc for every muscle group

I tend to go WAY heavier on legs like squats and dead lifts because it engages the core and really helps the body burn calories . Maybe it’s my imagination but it feels that way and placebo is sometimes good in losing weight / building muscle  

I was at 210 July first I’m at 185 August 20th 

That’s 25 pounds in under two months. I’m leaning out , retaining muscle and keeping that pump

The moral of the story is: do it

1mvqy6o,Supplements,Comprehensive L-Theanine Vendors List,"[L-Theanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine) is an amino acid found mainly in tea leaves (especially green tea) and in smaller amounts in some mushrooms. It isn’t a protein-building amino acid, but it has unique effects on the brain. Things like smoother focus, fewer jitters, calmer mood. Personally, I like it with coffee in the morning as I find it makes the caffeine buzz much more stable.

I’ve been digging through [vendor lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mtxnb3/ltheanine_vendor_breakdown/), [Reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mp0gsv/ltheanine_is_life_changing/), and product reviews to put together what I think is the most complete guide to the best L-Theanine vendors on Reddit right now. I’m not claiming to be the most experienced person in this space, and so this ranking leans heavily on community feedback and tries to balance price, quality, and reputation.

# Quick Note on Suntheanine

Suntheanine is a patented form of L-Theanine made through a fermentation process that guarantees purity and consistency. That’s why it shows up in premium, NSF-certified brands like Momentous and Country Life.

Regular L-Theanine is usually synthesized or extracted from tea leaves. It’s way cheaper per mg but can vary in quality. Both forms work, but Suntheanine is more about trust and certification. Whether it’s worth the extra money comes down to preference.

* [Pure Encapsulations](https://www.pureencapsulationspro.com/l-theanine.html?size=120%20capsules) – Best for clinical settings, but overpriced.  
* [Thorne’s Formula](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/theanine) – Same as Pure Encapsulations: premium branding, weak value.  
* [Natural Factors](https://naturalfactors.com/products/stress-relax-l-theanine-100-mg?srsltid=AfmBOoqWRbJ19teEzXtYNHlgn7EDJGrhP47sbPwwHGQddAGSjepvcHCJ) – Lowest value here and not well-regarded.

# Wrap Up

That’s my breakdown, but this list isn’t set in stone. Some people swear Suntheanine feels cleaner, others say generic works just as well.

Would love to hear from people who:

* Have tried both Suntheanine and regular. Did you notice a difference?  
* Have a go-to vendor you recommend.  
* Know of any good vendors I might’ve missed.

1mvhalo,Supplements,Suggestions to improve performance during endurance competition,"I will be competing for my 3rd year in the [Rebelle Rally](https://www.rebellerally.com/). It is a 10 day offroad navigation competition where we are navigating completely analog with only maps and compass. I am the navigator so my day starts at 5am plotting checkpoints on a map for 2 hours, then 10+ hours in the car reading the map and terrain to directs us to those checkpoints. It is high stress and due to nerves, I typically run on little sleep during the competition.  Mental clarity, quick thinking, and accuracy is so important out there, and last year I noticed myself making more mistakes on the last few days. We placed 6th last year, and looking to move up in the standings this year.

Does anyone have suggestions on supplements I could try to help with the mental focus and recovery? The rally starts in October, so I have about 1.5 months to try them out. This would just be something short term for me. I typically only take magnesium, vitamin D, and colostrum. I also don't drink energy drinks and only have 1 cup of coffee a day as my body typically sustains energy throughout the day.

1mtz5ul,keto,I never would have thought my grandfather would introduce me to keto,"I am 25 years old I work in an office and my diet could be summarized as a coffee to start a quick sandwich at lunch and junk food to keep me going in the afternoon. I was always tired unable to concentrate for more than 30 minutes.

Last weekend I was at my grandparents' and I was complaining about my fatigue. My grandfather an old school guy was listening to me nodding his head.

At one point he told me Your problem is that you're trying to heat your house by burning newspaper.

I didn't understand right away.

He continued The sugar and the fast stuff you eat it's like paper or twigs It makes a big flame right away it heats strongly for five minutes and then poof there's nothing left but ashes And you're cold again so you have to put more paper in again and again.

Then it started to make sense.

What you need he said tapping on the table is a good oak log It's harder to light but once it's going it gives you a gentle and constant heat for hours without you needing to tend to it.

This image of the log (proteins good fats) versus the newspaper (sugar) completely blew my mind.

When I got home I started to dig into the subject. I used a [TDEE Calculator ](https://lean-app.com/tdee-calculator/)to get a rough idea of the ""log size"" I needed for my day but it was mostly my grandfather's image that guided me.

It's been barely three weeks since I changed the way I eat. I replaced sweets with almonds I eat more complete meals with vegetables and proteins. The result is crazy. I no longer have the afternoon slumps. My energy is no longer a straw fire it's an ember that lasts all day.

The strangest feeling is no longer having those cravings that drove me crazy. It's a calm background energy. Not the excitement spike from sugar. It's just mega solid.

Anyway I wanted to share this little story. Sometimes the best nutritional advice doesn't come from books or from friends but sometimes from the person you least expect a grandfather and his campfire story.",2025-08-18 21:29:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mtz5ul/i_never_would_have_thought_my_grandfather_would/
1mvqtcr,bodyweightfitness,What Could this mean?,"So I've been trying to change my life around for the past year, going the fitness route to help with my discipline and impulse control since I suffer from ADHD.

Beginning this year I took a break for months as life threw it's inevitable curveball my way and I had health issues that made me stop and lost my gains, but I've resumed for the past months.

1msvy55,Nootropics,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you! The cheapest fucking energy drink I can figure out how to make...","90mg a serving, 16 servings on sale for like $3. I should have bought more on the sale. We will see if they come around again. I think the larger bottle equals out to a similar cost. Mixed well I'm seltzer as well. 

Also contains taurine, guarana, ginseng, B vitamins, and a couple other forms of minerals. So it's not like a ghost or something which is my preferred energy drink. It is something that is more affordable and reasonable, it's like less than $0.50 a serving. That's hard to beat. 

If anybody has any other ideas, I'd be happy to try it. I've tried the drink powder mix sticks, those end up coming about to be about $1.20 a piece. Anyways, I'm all ears. 

PS. I drink energy drinks cuz they're portable and can be mixed later in the day or drink later in the day. Well at work, where I work for myself usually far from home, I don't like spending money on coffee while out, I don't like drinking iced tea and calling it higher level caffeine, it is nice with the l-theanine and all, but I'm not going to try and replace energy drinks with coffee or iced tea.

So, I'm from Valais and live in the surroundings of Sion. We have never had any issues regarding wasps nor hornets for the part like 27 years we've been living here.
But for the past 3 weeks, I've had the visit of one hornet ( sometimes wasp but less often ) coming into the living room and right at my work desk.

I do no have any flowers inside, nor food/drinks lingering. I thought maybe it was my perfume because it's vanilla scented so I stopped using it. They're not aggressive, I just want to point that out. I just open the door and spray them and they leave.

Now I've checked everywhere on my balcony, even the outside blinds cover thing. I can see no nest nor hear anything. We are surrounded by trees and vines, so the nest might be anywhere.

Since yesterday, I've been burning coffee ground outside and it seems to help cause I see that hornet coming and flying off right away but I can't just be burning that all day long and don't want to poison my cat lmao.

I wanted to know if anyone has been going through the same thing this summer ? Or maybe have advice of other things I could use ? 
These are European hornets as well, not Asian btw.  And since it's just one, rarely two, I'd rather find repellant solutions for now and not contact the city to get the nest removed.

Thanks and have a great day !

EDIT : Thank you all for your suggestions ! Before going for a screen, I wanted to try the lemon with cloves thing. And funnily enough it worked ! He came 2 or 3 times last week and hasn't been seen since then 😄

1lh6mhp,Switzerland,Trying to escape daily rat race,"Hey everyone,

33M, EU citizen, living in Switzerland for 6 years — working in the scientific field, married, with a newborn. Life is stable, and I’m grateful for that. But lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m stuck in a loop — work, commute, home, repeat — and most social interactions feel... too scheduled and surface-level.

I’m looking to connect with people who are into real conversations — about investing, business ideas, financial freedom, geopolitics, and trying to live more consciously (instead of just running in the Monday–Friday hamster wheel). No agenda, no selling — just real talk with positive and optimistic people who do not focus on negatives and misery.

I enjoy racket sports (tennis, padel, etc.), so if you're into playing and talking ideas, even better.

It feels like nowadays even grabbing a coffee requires scheduling it weeks in advance, and that just makes life feel robotic. I’d love to build a small circle of like-minded people where meeting up feels natural — not a calendar event but something spontaneous and energizing.

I have realized that this might work with people who live close the the area that I live, and that is the reason why this is difficult to happen with working colleagues since the majority of them live in another canton. If you are in the area of Dübendorf, Walliselen, Oerlikon and in that area in general feel free to DM or drop a comment.

1kpp189,Switzerland,Espresso Roasters (Italian Type),"
Hey everyone,
I’m on the hunt for coffee roasters in Switzerland that offer South Italian-style espresso beans — the classic kind that’s dark, rich, low in acidity, and perfect for a strong, creamy espresso. Not a fan of the more modern, fruity or acidic profiles.

Until now, I’ve liked Stoll Coffee in terms of quality, but I’m wondering if there are other roasters out there (maybe more specialized or under-the-radar?) that really nail that deep, traditional southern Italian taste.

Any recommendations? Bonus points if they have locations near Zürich, Luzern, Basel Bern, !

Thanks a lot in advance!

To give an example, the day after the party, I helped set up the table for breakfast. I helped make coffee, tea, omelettes and prepare the bread. Not only did people pass food around me, they refused to even pass me the water jug when it was going around.

1fliwx3,Switzerland,The Mysterious Case of the Disappearing Coffee Machine at ETH Zurich,"So, ETH Zurich is known for being one of the top engineering schools in the world, right? Cutting-edge research, brilliant minds, and all that. But let me tell you about the one mystery even the brightest at ETH couldn’t solve.

It all started one chilly morning in the depths of the D-ITET building. You know the place: where students barely see the light of day, surviving on coffee and sheer determination. The coffee machine on the second floor was a lifeline—an old, trusty machine that had seen generations of caffeine-fueled engineers through countless problem sets and project deadlines.

One morning, though, disaster struck. The coffee machine was gone. Just…vanished. No note, no trace, just an empty spot where it used to be. Panic set in. Whispers spread through the building: *""Did someone steal it?""* *""Was it finally sent to the great recycling bin in the sky?""* *""Is this some kind of twisted social experiment?""*

Naturally, the students did what any group of engineers would do—they set up a task force. After all, they could solve complex differential equations and design robots; how hard could it be to find a coffee machine?

The first theory was that it had been abducted by the AI lab upstairs. Those folks were always tinkering with machines. But after some reconnaissance (read: bribing someone with a croissant), it turned out the AI folks were just as distraught as everyone else. No caffeine meant no machine learning.

Next, they turned to the physics department. Maybe they had borrowed it for some cutting-edge experiment? A student snuck into their lab (in broad daylight, because sneaking isn’t exactly an engineer’s strong suit) but found nothing. Just a bunch of lasers, and the distinct feeling that he didn’t belong there.

Days turned into weeks, and the coffee machine became a legend. New students arrived, only to hear tales of the “Great Coffee Machine Disappearance of 2024.” Some said it had simply phased out of existence, too tired to serve one more cup. Others believed it had achieved sentience and rolled itself out of the building in search of better coffee beans.

Then, one day, as suddenly as it had disappeared, the coffee machine reappeared. Same spot, the same old machine, as if nothing had happened. Except for one thing: a small, hastily scribbled note taped to it. It read, “Took a break. Needed a recharge. Even machines need a holiday. – CM”

To this day, no one knows what really happened. But one thing is certain: even at ETH Zurich, sometimes the most brilliant minds are no match for a tired coffee machine in need of a vacation.",2024-09-20 18:25:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1fliwx3/the_mysterious_case_of_the_disappearing_coffee/

1f9kcuv,Switzerland,Where to find not cheap and quality furniture ,"
I’m soon moving in a new apartment in Geneva area (now in a furnished temporary flat). I have already been living for a while in Zurich and this time I would like to settle for good in the new 3.5/4 rooms apartment.

Basically, during the moving Zurich—> Geneva, I gave away/sold lots of furniture (bed, sofa, garden sofa, chairs, lamps, shelter etc etc). 

I totally enjoy staying at home and having a cozy house, therefore I am looking already to nice furniture shops in Switzerland but also outside ch.

Most of my previous furniture was from home24, I didn’t like it very much, this time I want something higher in quality and design and I’m ready to pay for it.

I would like to avoid the various pfister, maison du monde, conforama, ikea shops.

I was checking Natuzzi in Italy for sofas and beds, milanobeds for beds, Roche bobois, and various lost niche producers in Tuscany, you get the idea. 

I don’t dislike second hand pieces. 

The style I am looking for is rather industrial/modern/bauhaus with vintage touches here and there. I like eccentricity and funny contrasts. (example: I had a huge chesterfield armchair under a pink neon lights in my living room, next to a huge Caravaggio style painting - or a Roman style column with hentai on it- you get the vibe. )

Ideally I’d need to buy what I mentioned above, rather big stuff (2 beds, chairs, sofa, carpet, library, coffee table, working desk, another armchair etc). 

Budget: 15k chf or more if I fell in love for something 

Questions: 
- do you have nice niche spots/ companies you think I could find what I am looking for? (Switzerland or Italy/france) 
- how would it work to make them come from outside ch eventually?I can do that? Would I have to pay some taxes I imagine

1e78j74,Switzerland,Is Victorian Era Micro-Management a thing in Switzerland's companies ?,"Heya!

  
I had a long fuss last week about yeah phone at work. I will make a long VENT text, you can read or just read the tl;dr and give your opinion on this.

**Tl;dr** : *Does you company have ""micro-management"" politics like no phone at work / restraining people to go to pee / things like that?* 

*Because I have my opinion on this subject, I will write it down just there with personal trivias, but I really want to know if it is me that is crazy, or if it is a standard to have what I call ""Victorian Era Micro-Management Rules that are made by people who try to have control on whatever they can because they lost control on their own life"".* 

*(Yeah I have a... anarchist mindset about it).*



When I was an apprentice my N+1 always told me ""I know you, I know you work well, but yeah don't be seen on your phone because it's badly seen in companies"" and I was like :

""Who cares as long as the job is done?""

""Do people really have time to check on me?""

Answers were :

""Everybody, some people only goals in life are micro-management even if it is not their responsability because it gives them an illusion of a control they don't have in their life anymore""

and

""No, but they will do whatever they can do find some to do exactly this instead of doing actual work.""

  
Turns out it was a really good advice and actually the whole key to be well seen in a company is pretending you are working as a perfect employee according to Hollywood movies standards, even if it implies sacrifying... quality of actual work. This is what I understood even if I had the theory all set after 10-15 years in my career. 

I got promoted to a Team Lead last year and I am doing well for now, the hierarchy is happy about my work and I'm thriving doing this. I don't have any management background (except Leutnant in the army but... yeah army management is not quite the same as the company ones lol) but I took a lot of courses, read a lot, and always found great personal acheivement to find ways to make a team productive while being happy because I've read somewhere that being happy / having a good quality of life at work increases producitivty.

Hopefully, in all companies I were in, conditions were set so I could be on my phone when I had nothing else to do, take longer coffee breaks as long as my job was being done, and go the toilets, go to drink, whenever I wanted because it is a basic need and unless you are a kid locked up in the closet by abusive sociopathic parents, nobody can prevent you to fullfill these needs in a developed country.

And really I always found it normal. This is why I said to my team : ""Yeah, I don't care at all about what you are doing in your days as long as your job is done and you do what is necessary to not give more job to the others"".

It is my limit, the only one that is interesting. If someone doesn't do his job, not good. If someone does the minimum but doesn't use his remaining time to take care of the shared responsabilities of the team and other teammates have to do it while he could have done it more easily because he had more time, yeah, not good neither. Things like that. But if there is nothing else to do or if they want to send messages during the infernal amount of loading times our softwares have or stuff, yeah go for it.

If they are on their phone 60% of one day because there was stricly nothing else to do, then it's my fault to not giving them enough work (these days happen and you can't do anything about it, work comes by waves depending on the period, sometimes you have to work a lot, and sometimes you are updated in every possible subject ever and not everyone have projects to work on so they have nothing to do). Not their faults. It would be cruel to force them to stare at the wall when there is nothing else to do, tbh they can go outside have a coffee it won't change the productivity of the day. I made the calculations.

Except that if they stared at the whole for 4 hours the next day they will be angrier to come to work, so nobody will be happy with that.

My team is responsible enough to do its job, I see it on the KPI, nobody from my team complains that some people don't work in my team and it looks fine, the results are given on time. If it changes because someone decides to go to the toilets 6 hours a day, yeah I WILL FORBID EVEREYONE TO GO TO THE TOILETS DURING DAY. No ofc not I'll just discuss with him and see what are our solutions. But it most likely won't happen, because we are adults professionnals. (I hope so).

  
OK to come up about what this thread was about,  during a weekly team lead stand-up/meeting, another Team Lead reported to me that ""yeah my team reported to me that they often see your team on their phone"".

We don't have at all the same work to do but we share the same work space. Yet they report their Team Lead about what my team does? WHY?  Do they really have time for that? Will it increase their own productivity? Why? Yet another mystery to solve for me.

I've waited all my life for this situation but never really came up with a huh DEI answer. Otherwise I'd be like ""who do they think you are, the GESTAPO, don't they even have a class consciousness anymore?"". 

""It is unfair because my team can't use phone so when they see your team using theirs they say it's unfair.""

""Then allow them to use their phones, idk""

""No because they won't work."" (ofc they are 8 yo kids)

""I think that the discipline in your team is none of my concerns. -- and if they think life is so perfect in my team we have 2 open positions rn they can just apply idk""

Then I asked my N+1.

""Is there a company rules about not using phones at work.""

And he tells me no (I mean I knew we searched for it together and asked the HR when I took the position lol).

Anyways it stops quite like that.

Everyone forbids it because it was there when they came in (it was put in place ni the 80s), and nobody questionned it.

But what surprises me the most is that most people think that if you don't forbid phones at work yeah nobody will work and stuff. That if people take 10 minutes to take a dump then the company will go bankrupt, or the shareholders will have to buy a private jet with less options and it will change their lives.

  
For me it's industrial era foreman's mindset. I'm not paid to watch people's peepee and things like that I have a lot of other responsabilities as a team lead that... monitoring peepee time. So it surprises me to see how important it his in people's mind in 2024.

(And I feel some quite of disgusts to people who don't even have the responsabilities to watch people's peepees in their job descriptions, yet they do it anyways and report whatever they can to management. I have a coworker from the other problematic team who takes note on coffee break times of her team's coworkers and... yeah. It takes a lot of time and energy to do that, she should use it on his own work instead. Expecially when it's known that she does a lot of mistakes, has a hard time finishing her work without help and stuff like that. It's never the best elements who micromanage their coworkers from my experience, this is why I really feel like this ""I have no control in my life anymore and I will make it everybody help's problem"").

  
So here with my solilloqy.

  
I wanted to know how your company is doing this and what is your opinion about it, I really want to know opinions from people I don't really used to hang on with, to see where the standards stand and stuff like that.

For those who read, thank you!",2024-07-19 16:54:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1e78j74/is_victorian_era_micromanagement_a_thing_in/
1e29vsa,Switzerland,Turnover Rate in the Hospitality Industry,"Hi,

I go to coffee shops quite frequently, and I feel that I am seeing ""new faces"" more frequently than before, maybe before 2021-2022. Moreover, some coffee shops (and restaurants) that I visited last year have closed their door entirely.

Is this a realistic assumption that more cafés/restaurants are closing than before, or more hospitality workers are leaving? Or it has always been like this and I just noticed? I saw these in both Switzerland and Germany

1d0wh46,Switzerland,Are these signs of something bigger happening?,"Hi,

A few months ago Migros changed leadership (CEO?) and since then some cost-cutting measures have been made: First I remember the novel coffee ball lines were halted from expansion to further foreign countries, then some sub-brands were put on sale. Very recently there were some layoffs.

A few weeks ago, Swisscom mentioned they were planning to charge for bluewin email accounts in the future, and some weeks later some users apparently reported their high-speed (mobile?) internet was cut in speed for ""too much usage"".

Now, each of these news articles looked at individually would be ""just news"". But put together, can they be considered signs of something bigger happening to the whole country and its economy? What do you think? Any other pieces to ""complete the picture""?

Thanks

P.S. I know I should find web links for each news line above, and I will add them here. Also my one-line summaries may be pretty inaccurate, but I hope they do not affect the question I want to ask.

It happened to me several times already: I got a new job or go to a new work site and I meet a work colleague. Let's say from an adjacent team, we don't interact all the time, but we will see each other often.

So the first time that we happen to be in contact, we exchange a few words, we meet at the coffee machine, whatever. I say ""My name is John"" or ""By the way I am John"".  And they sometimes look at me like they don't know what to say. They don't introduce themselves. There is an awkward pause but no introduction from their side. They just don't say their name.

Now that I think about it my direct boss didn't really introduce me to any of my close collaborators mentioning names. I am completely perplexed. Are these people just trying to be assholes? Some of them don't seem like the type.

To be clear I am an obvious ""Ausländer"" but I speak perfect German, understand Schwiitzerdütsch without any problems, I'm learning French and Italian, the official company language is English anyway, there is no language barrier. But there is obviously some huge misunderstanding going on and it drives me crazy. I'm just trying to be polite but there is an obvious disconnect. Should I wait until they introduce themselves?

18f0q46,Switzerland,What are your top ways to save money in Switzerland?,"We all know that this country is expensive as hell. What are your top strategies?  


Here are some of mine:  
\- groceries that can be stored easily: order bulk deliveries from Aldi (no transport costs if you buy enough, also saves you time). Sometimes there are offers on the Migros delivery service too. Get yourself a freezer if you haven't got one and use it.

\- fresh groceries: in ZH and other cities there are several Middle Eastern or S Asian shops with a great selection and decent prices

\- rent: if possible, always contest 

\- insurance: get the cheapest options that cover you sufficiently on comparis. Switch to equivalent options if cheaper. 

\- mobile/internet: only get reduced subscriptions. If your contract is about to expire, phone customer service and say you want to end it. They will try to coax you into remaining with a new offer, which you can often negotiate down

\- trains: it's possible to save a bit with Sparbillet and SBB Easyride. Use GA Hinterlegung when you're away.

\- taxes: max out your deductions (e.g property management costs, CHF 700 if you have a bike in ZH, Säule 3a, educational and training expenses, donations)

\- coffee: make your own high quality coffee at home instead of buying the expensive and insipid takeaway stuff

\- subscriptions: Use revolut, fake GPS apps and vpns to sign up for services in other countries (e.g YouTube premium via Argentina billing for \~CHF1.5/month)

\- takeaway: use Too good to go

\- skiing: magicpass, snow & rail or interdiscount (apparently)

\- car: if you're in the city, you probably don't need a car

18cd3sa,Switzerland,Aftermarket cafe royal balls,"Hi fellow Swiss redditors,

I am thinking of purchasing the coffee-b machine from cafe royal as it is currently on a great discount (almost unbelievable for Switzerland - 50chf instead 150chf and you get 50chf worth of coffee balls for free as a starter pack). Now I know that this coffee machine works like printers: they don’t make the money from the device, that they sell at a loss for sure, but from the price of the balls. And indeed the balls are expensive!! I was wondering if there’s anywhere I can buy aftermarket balls (maybe Lidl or Aldi?) for much cheaper.

While I’m at it, does anybody also know where to buy aftermarket flat capsules for the nespresso machines? At work we are required to buy them ourselves but I cannot find them anywhere. It’s like this flat aluminium colored cussion from Nespresso.

I took my orange Victorinox (I've always had one since I was a child), cut the side and took out two paper sheets. The sheets were folded in half so I could read just the first words in bold: ""Subject: Naturalization Application"", the same words in bold of a previous letter stating they needed more documents. I admit, I was afraid there was another issue, another document request or the deny of my application.

I unfolded the sheets and read just the first line. I didn't need to read further... Then I turned to my wife and hugged her while a tear ran down my face.

16wxgg1,Switzerland,My thoughts after doing an internship in Switzerland for 3 months,"Did someone ask for my opinion? No but here it is anyway.
Apart from the things everyone mentions like clean streets and trains on time, here are the things that caught my eye. 

1st there are only a few things deemed ""too expensive"" by the people I worked with. Those are meat, trains and health insurance. To me it seems like compared to salaries the prices of other things are actually reasonable 

2nd It's great that your trains are on time and clean but how do you have the most expensive trains without wifi? Trains in Czech republic are cca 4€/h (10x cheaper) and the ones build in this Century have decent wifi. This was a bit of shock.
Edit: everyone is commenting about unlimited data. I didn't realize this was wide spread as the price I got for short term plan was a lot higher than what I see is a normal price. 

3rd back to pricing....I see people on this subreddit complaining about rent prices in Zürich and other big cities. I don't think there is a major European city that doesn't have this problem.

4th bus drivers in Valais have unbelievable skills and a big pair of balls driving up and down the mountains. I'd be scared to drive that fast in car let alone a bis with a trailer.

5th I love sports and I was glad to see that everyone was really active. Not only did it motivate me but I also met very nice people. This was a trend in general, that people I met were approachable through their interest.

6th This I think is on many people's minds - some new touristic hotspots should be better organized for the number of visitors.

Edit2: Selecta coffee was the same price and quality as many coffee shops in Prague. This was crazy in the beginning but I got used to it quickly. Now I went to get coffee back home and I miss it already.

Edit3: I just almost got ran over by a car because I got too used to drivers stopping generously for everyone.

one problem... im not anywhere near a nutritionist to know what to change it into

please give me anything that can replace the nutella, maybe even the bread and is healthier

I'm currently in **week 2**, and honestly, I’ve noticed a few things already:

* **Energy:** There’s this natural energy kick I get after taking it – kinda like a clean coffee buzz, without the jitters. It hits different but in a good way.
* **Appetite:** This one surprised me. I’ve been feeling **fuller** throughout the day, to the point where I’m not finishing full meals like I usually do. It’s been harder to eat a complete plate.
* I’ve been **semi-fasting** while taking it (not a strict schedule, just intuitive), and it’s actually helped. When I feel hunger pangs creeping in, I just drink more of the Gut Goodness mix, and that holds me down for a while.

Not making any huge claims here – just logging how it’s going for now. I’ll keep updating as I go further along.

I used to use my partner's Ninja blender for my Momentum Shakes, but it's so big and loud, and we don't have a lot of counter space for it to be convenient.  I finally discovered a smaller, light weight, cordless blender that you can drink straight from with the companion sippy lid that comes with it, and I'm digging it!

This blender is super cute, and is good for not overdoing your portions if you're like me and eyeball it. It's just as powerful as other bigger blenders, but definitely surprisingly more quiet (perfect for our thin apartment walls), and I don't have to pour my smoothies into a separate cup so it reduces clean up. I can just put the sippy lid on and take it with me. It tucks away in my partner's coffee cabinet shelf without taking up necessary space, and the fact I don't have to use up outlet space is a huge bonus as well. So far the battery has held enough charge that I haven't had to charge it yet.

The only cons I've found are the plastic seam of the lip that curls inward at the bottom of the blender cup is  sharp - so be careful when cleaning it/wiping it! I also startled myself when I accidentally touched the Power button while dismantling the blender to clean it - the button is very sensitive and doesn't take much effort to press and activate.

Here are the top 3 powerful benefits of green smoothies that have helped me enhance my health! 💪✨

**1. Nutrient-Rich Goodness 🥒**  
Green smoothies are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Ingredients like spinach, kale, and chard are nutrient-dense and support overall health. Adding fruits like berries and bananas not only boosts the nutrition but also makes the smoothies super tasty!

**2. Improved Digestion 🥗**  
High in fiber, green smoothies aid digestion and keep you feeling full for longer. Since adding them to my diet, my digestion has improved significantly. If you're new to green smoothies, try starting with spinach—its mild flavor blends well with fruits.

**3. Natural Energy Boost ⚡**  
Unlike the quick highs and lows of coffee or sugary snacks, the natural sugars and nutrients in green smoothies provide a sustained energy boost. I've experienced a consistent rise in my energy levels throughout the day since making green smoothies a daily habit. It's a tasty and easy way to keep your energy up without the crash! 🌞

My base greens
1 cup frozen cherries
1 tbs ground cocoa 
1 tbs cinnamon
1 banana
2tbs coffee beans
1tbs each flax, hemp

I was a little worried because my base that I pre made earlier smelled almost fermented, which is fine, but I didn’t know how it was going to end up tasting,  somehow the combo evened out the wierd smell of the base and it was amazing!

What are some suggestions to sustain weight loss while also not having to quit coffee?

Edit: 1. I am a vegetarian (if that's relevant)
2. I am not from North America so the region specific suggestions might not apply (thanks anyways though :))
3. I cannot afford high quality roasted coffee and instant coffee tastes shit when made black
4. I use about 175 ml of skimmed milk per cup of coffee
5. I also do not have access to plant based milk and artificial sweeteners

I know these edits make my situation seem impossible but it is what it is I guess. Also, I wasn't expecting to be judged for my dietary choices. My culture, region, spending ability also weigh into my dietary choices so yeah :) 

One suggestion that seems to be workable is reducing the quanity of milk and/or substituting the reduced quantity with water. This seems pretty doable!",2023-06-29 19:45:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/14megk1/is_drinking_2_cups_of_milk_sugar_coffee_everyday/

I fully understand the need to hydrate better and the importance of water. The challenge is, I really dislike the taste of water, and as a result, I'm not disciplined enough to drink it as I should - even when I set reminders and keep a glass with me all day.

I don't mind Gatorade or Powerade-type drinks but also understand if those serve as my primary source of hydration that's a lot of sugar. This leads to my next challenge: I dislike the taste of 'sugar alternatives' more than plain water (I'm pretty sure I've tried them all).

I guess what I'm looking for is something like a Gatorade or Powerade w/ maybe half (or less) the sugar content those drinks contain.

I was wondering what recommendations you guys would have for a morning drink to add to my routine. 


Here’s what I’ve been thinking/wanting:
- No caffeine
- Low/no sugar
- Low calories
- Low cost
- Low waste/environmentally friendly 
- I don’t mind running to the store for ingredients since I live close to a market I can bike to.  


So far, here are my ideas:
- Sparkling water
- Water + fruit/add my own flavors
- Hot cocoa 
- Decaf coffee",2023-02-08 18:03:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/10x6668/healthy_drink_suggestions_for_the_morning/
10pm0g7,HealthyFood,Help with Golden Milk!!,"Okay, hopefully, I can FINALLY get this to post ***somewhere!!***

Anyways, I found a recipe online for making Golden Milk. It was something like:

1. 1tsp turmeric
2. 1tsp cinnamon
3. 2tsp local raw honey
4. 2-pinches of ground black, white, and red pepper
5. 1tsp of ground ginger
6. 1cup of A2 whole milk 

According to the recipe, this would be 2 servings. 

It said to mix ingredients and bring it to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Okay, so I did all of that; great! Now the issue... no matter *what* I tried to strain this through - I did not have cheesecloth, so that isn't something I was able to try - it would ***not*** strain. And I mean **at all!** I tried using a wet coffee filter - NOPE, it didn't work, and in fact, it was the only thing that didn't even allow a drop of liquid through! Next, I tried using a wet napkin. Again, this did not work! However, I did get a couple of drops through before it invariably stopped dripping (I even tried using a spoon to sort of pull away any of the ""clumps"" from the seasonings). The only other thing I had that I could try was a washcloth. I figured since washcloths are very porous, this would work, but because of how porous it was, I expected some of the 'seasonings' to get through into the drink, but this didn't work either!! In the end, I put a couple of wet coffee filters under the rag and sort of gently squeezed them to get what little liquid I could get from this. I ended up with less than 1/4 of a cup! 

So, my question is for anyone that has made this drink before - obviously, it may not be the exact same recipe I used as there are a crazy number of different recipes for this out there - how the hell did you manage to actually strain this so you could get more than a few drops out of the final product? I'd like to make it again, as what little I managed to get tasted pretty good, and the health benefits are pretty substantial, but there is no way I will make it again if I cannot even strain the crap! 

I want to go ahead and thank anyone that provides a solution to this problem for their time and assistance. (I also spent a long time trying to find a solution to this prior to making a post, but 99% of what I got were just damned recipes for golden milk!

My supper will usually be a mix, Ill make bacon&eggs, meat, some quickly microwaved rice. Nothing out of this world healthy.

I went to pour some oat milk into my cup and thought, huh, this is a funny color for oat milk.. it’s pretty yellow.. (while still pouring for whatever reason) until it hit me in the face like a bag of bricks- I had picked up the container of bone broth- not oat milk. 
I decided to give it a try since i already put agave and cinnamon in the cup of coffee, and I’m not gonna lie its actually pretty tasty!
Maybe I just discovered a hack of some sort for an extra boost to my coffee, haha.
I did something similar a few months ago except I mistook the cumin for cinnamon. The result was not nearly as good. 😆",2022-08-03 15:22:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/wf9ebt/healthiest_coffee_i_ever_had/
wefbop,HealthyFood,Can someone upgrade my breakfast? I need to replace the processed meat with something healthy but retain the high protein.,"My breakfast usually consists of:

szhqzb,HealthyFood,"""Healthy"" Food Perks for the Workplace Culture?","Hello,

Our CEO has tasked me with coming up with a food-centric perk for our 71-employee location.

In the past, we had a ""cereal bar"" ([image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2078/6445/products/KCH-06151_LS01_3000px_3000x.jpg?v=1569117596)) – I managed the whole thing, the dispensers, ordering the cereal and milk, replenishing the cereal/milk, cleaning it; but also, soliciting employees for cereal preferences. I kept this up for at least a year or so. It was *fun* while it lasted, but looking back on it, it isn't the healthiest. I expressed this to our CEO, and he agrees we could use a healthier version of a ""cereal bar."" (More importantly, less time-consuming.)

He suggested an idea for fruit delivery service to our break rooms – something like [Fruit That Works](https://fruitguys.com/office-fruit-delivery/) or [SnackNation](https://snacknation.com/office-fruit-delivery/) – but his initial concern is that he doesn't want people taking the fruit with them to their homes and families, in place of grocery shopping. The idea is to boost employee morale and retention, you know? Keep us happy (and ideally healthy) while working. His idea is perhaps we can set a rule that employees must only eat the food on site? We both feel like that's mostly unenforceable.

We already have snack food vending machines (albeit being junk food), soda vending machines, an espresso/coffee machine (free), and filtered water dispensers (free).

We're in NC, USA.

Open to all ideas!

Bonus points for talking about your own ""healthy"" work place food perks! 

Also, what's your food perk wish list?

11vo5i9,Fitness,What kind of training/trainer should I go for starting my fitness journey (again),"TL;DR: I don't trust LA/Esp*rta personal trainers or any big box gym. Am I too novice to see a powerlifting coach? 

I feel like I trust ""specialty"" trainers more than the generic ones. I also want to have fun working out again which is what I like about powerlifting/body building style training. I know discipline is critical to maintaining a good lifestyle but the fun of doing/being more is unmatched.

HISTORY: So I was a gym rat in my late teens/early 20s and I feel like I've forgotten how to do everything. I loved lifting and I used to get help with training from the friends/coworkers at the gym I worked at. But other than that it was mostly all self taught or just doing whatever my friends routines were that day which I would adopt as my own on solo days.

CURRENT: I'm a nurse commuting to a major hospital about 45-60 mins away so distance for a good gym/ trainer isn't an issue for me. That being said, I'm verrrrryyyy busy and on my feet for 14 + hours 3-4 days a week. I am on ADHD medication and forget to eat on work days (seriously I'II eat a banana, a coffee, and a cake pop in a day). So I need help with diet and exercise. I also feel that my weight gain over the years has significantly limited my ability to do the routines I did before. My scoliosis has also progressed as well but my insurance doesn’t kick in until June so I’m SOL until then. I definitely have a right shoulder sag because of it so that would also have to be factored in until I can see PT about it.

MY GOALS/NEEDS:
- Trainer equipped with knowledge about form modifications r/t scoliosis, diet plans r/t medication induced anorexia*
- Overall health improvement (improve cardiac function, energy levels, hormone balance)
- Routines that accommodate my schedule (3-4 day split maybe?)
- I am motivated but I lose “hope” easily if I’m not being guided or given timelines/metrics to achieve

*Not to be confused with the psychological illness. I have no issues eating anything (besides dairy and gluten). I take Adderall which completely blocks feelings of hunger bc it’s a stimulant. “You know you need to eat, why not just eat even if you’re not feeling hungry bc of your medicine?” I get nauseous even thinking about trying to eat on my medication. I will pick food up, take a bite or two, and immediately have to put it down bc I can barely swallow the bites I took. This is what I mean about anorexia.  
 
I feel I have come to a point where intervention is needed because I am unable to self start/sustain myself in way that isn’t painful or efficient given my needs. Who/what should I look for in a trainer? Will “specialty” trainers be a waste/willing to work with me despite no current interest in competing? I am commuting to the Tampa, FL area if anyone has any specific suggestions.",2023-03-19 15:24:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/11vo5i9/what_kind_of_trainingtrainer_should_i_go_for/

HIGH PROTEIN DIET BUT NO SERIOUS LIFTING (2015-2019):

While studying at university, I had casually started going to the gym with my buddies, learning a bit about nutrition and working out. I gradually understood the importance of protein and calorie intake, progressive overload, rest and sleep, having a routine and being disciplined. With ups and downs, I would have periods when I would focus more on my workouts and stressful periods where I would not progress at all because I would not spend much time at the gym. I was around 86-88 kg for the whole period and my aim was to lose 5-6 kg, build some muscle and become more fit.

HOME WORKOUTS/COVID (2020)

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, having plenty of free time, I started working out at home, mainly doing pushups and when I had access to some outdoors bars I would do pull-ups/leg raises/dips. When I went back home and I had access to the sea I would also go swimming almost every day. Nothing crazy, just for 10-15 minutes.

2021-2022 GYMS REOPEN

In 2021, I would casually go back to the gym, more chilled with my nutrition, enjoying desserts and fatty foods here and there. I would walk for at least 1 hour a day (commute and back) so I would still lose some weight and finally become around 80-82 kg.

2023 FITNESS BECOMES PRIORITY

This January I decided to sign up to a new gym with a sauna, swimming pool and steam room and accepted a challenge by a friend on who can become most ripped over the next year or so. So I started reading in various subreddits on what I should do, realising at around 80 kg I need to lean bulk up first and then cut (something I never actually did, at least on purpose). So I am back into reading about workouts and nutrition, using the sauna after my morning workouts as it makes me feel good and trying to bulk in a proper way, eating healthy foods.

PROGRAM

I chose to mix compound exercises with isolation exercises so that each day is focused around at least one main muscle group. One of the reasons I am posting this is to get feedback about my program. I feel like I started with a proper program and over the years I customised it so many times so that I am adaptable to what’s available in the gym and to what I feel like doing on that day. I work out 6-7 days a week so I am targeting most muscle groups more than once in a week. For most exercises, I would have a dynamic warm-up first (small or no weight) and then start the actual sets. Over time, I am increasing the weight, to achieve progressive overload or add extra reps/sets in my workout.  I occasionally have an intense 15-minute ab workout with very small breaks, targeting upper abs, lower abs and obliques.

Day 1 - Chest

4 x (8 reps +) Barbell Bench Press (from just the bar warm-up to 90kg)

4 x (8 reps +) Dips with just bodyweight

4x (8 reps +) Dumbbell Incline Bench Press (up to 34 kg per hand)

3x (8 reps +) Cable fly from above

6x (6-8 reps) Pull Ups (just bodyweight)

3x (8 reps +) Dumbbell Row (16 kg each hand separately)

4x (8-10 reps) Squats (~~up to 60 kg~~ \- need to increase this) EDIT: 90kg recorded [myself](https://imgur.com/LCIlqyD) this morning feeling energetic and after reading comments was not afraid to increase weight (let me know what you think of the form)

4x (8 reps +) Tricep Dips (just bodyweight)

4x (8 reps) rear delt fly (small weight - e.g. 5 kg)

DIET

I started tracking macros and calories via MyNetDiary. I use my apple watch which is synced with the app to adjust the calorie budget depending on my daily activity. Working out every day, I need around 3.3k kcal for maintenance or 3.5k kcal for a 0.5 kg gain per month. I use the rule of thumb of having up to 2g of protein for each kg of my body weight, so my goal is to have around 160g of protein every day. I prefer foods low on saturated fats and I minimise red meat consumption. The macro split on a typical day would be 20% protein, 20% fat and 60% carbs. I find this well balanced with my goals and the high amount of carbs makes me feel energetic in my workouts. This is still my first week tracking so I need to do some trial and error so that I achieve the desired result.

My most popular meals are (I would sometimes have breakfast/lunch twice in a day):

Breakfast: (44g protein/580kcal) Protein scoop, 55g oats, 50g blueberries, one banana, 100g 5% fage Greek yoghurt

Lunch: (54g protein/630kcal)250g Brown rice (microwaved for 2 mins) + 220g chicken breast

Dinner: Homemade pizza (47g protein/1000kcal)

SUPPLEMENTS: Whey/vegan protein powder and protein bars to boost protein intake (and coffee for pre-workout!).

END

Thank you for spending your time reading all this. I know I had very slow progress in the first few years with almost non-existent progress until 2020, but I think what matters is the way forward, so happy to hear your thoughts. Writing this was helpful for me, gathering my thoughts and reflecting on areas to improve. I am the happiest I have even been and feeling healthy and confident with my body, and this was not always the case. I hope this can help others in their own journeys.

**My 20s and 30s**

A call-center job chained to a desk, along with moving to a big city and eating amazing food, caused me to balloon from my teenage size to 300 lbs in my 20s. At my worst, I was eating ~4000 calories of trash a day, with no real veggies and very little protein. A typical breakfast was a stop at 7-11 for an extra-large iced mocha latte, two donuts and three deep fried taquitos. I would snack all day on Doritos and Dr Pepper. A typical supper was a 1200cal chicken parm sub. I had severe sleep apnea, various bowel issues, fucked up knees, constant back pain, rashes, irritated eyes and nose. I was a walking heart attack.

&nbsp;

**Initial Weight Loss**

This is where the ""mistakes were made"" meme comes in, at least according to current wisdom. In 2015 at age 35 I went to the doctor, who determined that a) my blood pressure was moments away from a stroke and b) in her heavy French accent, ""we found some diabetes"" in my blood work. I asked her what to do, and thankfully she did not give me pills, but said ""lose weight."" I said I would.  Had a little cry in the car, and decided then and there to change.

It gets dicey here, because I googled the whole diabetes thing, and it sure seemed like sugar and simple carbs were to blame. Rather than take a reasonable approach, I dove head-long into Paleo, religious fervor and all. The good news? Cutting out carbs had immediate effect, and ""felt easy"", in that meals were still enjoyable. By pure willpower and my new belief that ""all sugar was poison,"" I quit everything else cold turkey. Drank water only, no more snacks, no more pop, nothing. I tracked everything with MyFitnessPal, which I still preach to this day (even if temporarily, to see where you're at). My daily caloric intake went down into the 1300-1500 calorie range. And I was very, very consistent.

The weight melted off. As I'm sure many would agree, too fast. 30 lbs in 2 weeks. 50-60 in about 3 months. From April to November I went from 300 lbs to 190. My only physical activity was walking. EVERY SINGLE DAY, no matter what, at least one hour, often two. Podcasts probably saved my life. Eventually, I worked my way up to jogging and then to running. Zero lifting. Most joint pain went away, bowels started working right, rashes and itchiness and disappeared. I ""cured"" the pre-diabetes, got my BP under control. After maintaining my weight for four years, I retired my CPAP machine. Went from a 44 waist to 32, 2XL shirts to Medium.

So this may all sound amazing, but the low-carb stuff and severe calorie restriction damaged my relationship with food and I still struggle a bit today (I'm happy to discuss this further in the comments). Also, because I didn't lift, I lost a ton of muscle, and looked kinda gaunt and flabby (see: pic of me in the red t-shirt.) I badly pulled my quad helping a friend move a couch, and realized I might've made some mistakes.

&nbsp;

**Starting Lifting**

Strength training began in late 2016 after talking with some friends about it. At first I just bought a shitty weight set for home and randomly did exercises, poorly. Eventually I got to talking with my friend Brandon, who's also an online S&C coach, and we started on a very beginner-friendly Functional Fitness program. I know that term has been beaten to death in online fitness over the years but considering my numerous mobility and joint issues, it was the right call. Simple bodyweight exercises to improve mobility (hip hinge drills, squat holds, T-spine mobility), lots of isometric work to build core strength (planks, dead bugs), and most importantly, work to strengthen my back using Stuart McGill's ""Big 3.""

&nbsp;

**Trail Running**

While beginning this, I still felt that I ""needed"" to run. My knees felt good. I moved up North and out to the country, and got further into trail running. This culminated in competing in my first race, a 7km trail run at Limberlost Forest. This is where my coach helped me understand that you don't need to run miles a day to have ""decent"" conditioning; he insisted I not go out and ""run 7km every day."" Instead, we did sprint drills on my rest days, 10sec on, 20sec off, as well as hill sprints. To my surprise, I felt good during the race and finished 77th out of 200+ entries.

It also made me realize that I don't really like running, and I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. So I haven't really gotten back into it since. The iron suits me better.

&nbsp;

**Current Training**

Because I started in my late 30s after 15yrs of destroying my body, there's a heavy focus on warm up and mobility work. Some on this sub might see it as busy work or junk volume, but it's all in the service of staying pain-free OR working around minor aches and pains, and improving on my limitations. I care about that more than I care about numbers on the bar. I don't back squat, for example--I either front squat or KB squat. There's a lot of Dan John and Mike Boyle influence.

The other day when I was sitting in a deep, long squat at work, a co-worker was asking me wtf I was doing. I said ""I'm squatting like this at 42 so I can squat like this at 82.""

Since I began weight training, I have missed zero training days. ZERO. In many cases I've delayed one by a day, and I've worked through and around minor injuries and sickness. When I travel I bring a kettlebell and I get work done. I've also lifted with COVID--perks of a home gym. No matter what, above all else, CONSISTENCY. Good workout, shit workout, just TRAIN. 80% effort the rest of your life is better than 100% effort half the time.

My current program consists of four 4-week blocks. First block is high rep work, second block is ramping reps, third block increases RPE, ramping upward each week, and fourth block ramps heavy maxes, no more than 5 reps on most lifts. Full-body 3x a week. I feel this suits me because I have no specific goals, and I don't compete. I have no idea what my 1RMs are and don't really care. I just want to progress. The programming is vaguely powerlifting-based, in that each day focuses on Bench, Deadlift, or Squat, but my coach is a kettlebell fiend, and I've fallen in love with them as well, so they factor in as often as the barbell.

I don't want to make the post even bigger than it already is, so I don't think I should post the entire program. But here's an example of this week, which is ramping RPE and includes complimentary plyo movements in a Giant Set:

&nbsp;

**Warmups**

* [MBSC Flow Warmup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brjs42oQ7FU&t=2s)

&nbsp;

**Wednesday**

* Olympic Ring Row 3x8
* Pushup Walkout+Pushups (3x5,6,7,8 reps by week)

&nbsp;

* Skater Squat to 2 pads 3x5 (AMRAP last week)

* Deficit Calf Raises (2x5,6,7,8 by week)

&nbsp;

* Poundstone Curls to failure x2
* Tricep Pullovers x2 to failure to Finish

&nbsp;

Note: my ""Finish"" varies wildly depending on what I want to do, and also weather. I often like to do heavy farmer's carries (bodyweight or more) to failure or sled pushes in the summer. In the winter I stick mostly to kettlebell complexes and just try and wear myself out.

Rest days are for active rest. I walk my dog daily, I do a ton of hiking and kayaking, and I'm thinking about buying a bike. I also work in auto parts so I spend most of my day on my feet, walking around a warehouse carrying things.

If I had to bro-guess my lifts (based on 5 rep maxes), they're around 385 on the deadlift, 190-200 bench, and 200 on the front squat.

&nbsp;

**Nutrition**

As mentioned before, my diet lost a ton of weight, but really messed with my eating habits.  After I hit my goal, I simply reintroduced more calories, but after lots of reading and getting to know the science better, I dropped the Paleo and started eating carbs again. But I STILL ""feared carbs,"" and tended to not eat as much as I should. I was sort of permanently hovering around 2000 calories until last year, worried about putting weight back on, worried about the bathroom scale, worried about carbs. I was always cold. I felt great in terms of strength and energy though.

My coach finally convinced me to just not look at the scale, and try to eat a bit more intuitively. The result? I gained like 1 lb over the course of a year, while recomping muscle a bit and looking better. Lifts went up. After that, we talked about adding more calories, mostly carbs. From my lowest weight of 183 (first shirtless pic), I've put on about 15 pounds, some of which I sure hope is muscle (last pic). If and when my pants get tight, I'll probably cut again. After all, I've done it before.

I really do consider my nutrition a strength now. I try not to track anymore, hovering around 2600-2800 calories. I shoot for 0.7-0.8g/lb of protein, which means 170-180g. I fill the rest in with carbs and fat, moreso carbs now, which is where I was lacking before. Breakfast every day is a protein shake with a scoop of whey isolate, spinach, fruit of some kind, creatine, and unsweetened almond milk, and a bowl of oatmeal. I meal prep lunches EVERY. SINGLE. SUNDAY no matter what. Lunch is 40-50g of protein, usually chicken or ground turkey, roasted potatoes or rice, and a veg like Broccoli. Small protein bar for a snack every single day, a cup of plain Greek yogurt most days, sometimes with chocolate chips or berries in it. Suppers are where I let loose and play around, I love to cook, but at their core is always 40-50g of protein. I try to keep red meat to once a week, usually a lean cut of steak. Post-workout dinners are often big breakfast plates with 3-4 eggs, egg whites, turkey bacon, roasted potatoes and a good multi-grain bread with peanut butter. To ""get my carbs in"" now, I'll have another bowl of oatmeal or a PB&J sandwich.

I drink only black coffee and water. I eat three big meals and two or three snacks every day. But I've also learned to live a little, my healthy habits are firmly in place so it's okay to eat junk now and then. A latte every now and then, a restaurant a couple times a month (usually a big breakfast). Occasionally a Halo Top ice cream. If I want a cookie or a donut, I have one. I still try to keep cheap snacks out of the house to prevent binging--if I want a treat, I have to go to the bakery and get a treat. Make it worth it.

I would say these are the four biggest tips I could give on nutrition: track what you eat (at LEAST for the first few months), have the occasional snack, don't drink your calories, and MEAL PREP. You ""can"" do a huge caloric deficit like I did and succeed, and then go back to eating somewhat normally, but most will fail in that.  Better to consistently reinforce good habits and drop the weight more slowly. For others, simply focusing on becoming stronger and more mobile while eating ""a bit better"" can be enough. More protein, more fibre, less junk.

&nbsp;

**Mental Health, Body Image**

This is still a daily struggle for me, even though I do feel some pride in what I accomplished. I struggle with anxiety, and looking back it was obvious I stress-ate. I've replaced the food with behavioural therapy, and trying to just relax more, get out in nature, get off social media, read more books.

I have loose skin, but as you can see in the pics it's not too bad now that I've put some muscle on. If I bend over, it still looks like melted cheese, but if I'm standing up, I have abs and my obliques even show up a little. I think since I started eating enough, my shoulders, chest and even traps have come in a little. My quads have grown very noticeably, and my wife says ""I have an ass now."" But body dysmorphia is real and I still think ""I'm getting too fat"" or ""my arms aren't big enough."" I just keep telling myself that consistency is all that matters. Show up and do the damn thing. I owe a lot to my coach, keeping me grounded and keeping my workouts interesting and challenging. I look forward to training.  I do this for overall fitness, health and well-being. I do this so I can still be moving and active and healthy in my 80s. I'm mostly pain free and I now have the knowledge to stay that way. I look, move and feel better at 42 than I did at 22.  It also encouraged my wife to eat better and exercise, and she's lost about 40 lbs from her heaviest! I couldn't be more proud of her.

I'm happy to answer further questions in the comments. Thanks for listening to my rambling!",2022-12-16 00:07:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zn0sou/progress_42m511_300lbs_to_183lbs/
tf0rpt,Fitness,Strategies For Achieving 10% Body Fat and Pushing Through a Plateau,"#  Context:

I am trying to get to 10% body fat for the first time. It's been proving pretty difficult, but one thing has more or less helped me through the entire process-- understanding caloric deficit. I've been trying to keep myself in a caloric deficit for a while now, but I've run into a problem. I'm at just under 12% bodyfat, eating roughly 1300 calories per day, and plateauing. I understand that reaching a goal such as 10% body fat requires strict dietary requirements, but from what I've seen, other people can achieve the same goal, all the while eating more calories.

I tried to look online just to get a general idea of how many calories other people were eating to reach the same milestone, only to not be able to find any numerical answer. The best I could do was brief mentions from fitness YouTubers where they would say roughly 1800\~2000 calories, which is substantially more than I am currently intaking. I am primarily interested in developing an understanding of what is *generally* normal caloric intake for those trying to reach certain body fat goals, because there seems to not be a clear consensus; I understand full well that it varies from individual to individual, so to reiterate, I'm just trying to create a range so as to establish normalcy.

It is my hope to learn and improve my own diet, and for this post to help others do so as well.

# Details on me, if you want a better picture:

* 5'8""
* Male
* 19 Years old, almost 20
* Substantial muscular development (could pass as a Marvel Hero)
* Currently at 11.9% body fat (using an electric scale)
* Between 158 and 160 lbs (fluctuates, just wanted to give a good idea)

# Typical diet consists of:

* Supplements, including: amino acid pills, fish oils for omega-3s, zinc, selenium, and multivitamin gummies (Don't judge me, I like what I like), **70 calories**
* 1/2 cup of oatmeal + scoop of protein (**25g protein**) + 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, **300 calories**
* Caffeinated coffee, 1/3 cup almond milk (unsweetened) + 3 packets of Splenda, **20 calories**
* Post workout protein shake, 1 scoop protein (**25g protein**) + 1 scoop of creatine + 1 table spoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, **150 calories**
* 5 ounces of chicken breast, twice a day. To be safe, I round up to 50 calories an ounce. I do this because I marinate the chicken, and use a bit of olive oil and a bit of sauce in the marinade. 50x5x2 = **500 calories, 90 grams of protein**
* Single Drumstick brand ice cream cone (I know that ice cream isn't healthy, but considering how few calories I otherwise eat in the day, I figured it was acceptable, especially considering how it helps prevent me from splurging and, consequently, backtracking). Roughly **290 calories**
* 4 cans of diet soda a day, 2 of which are caffeinated. While claiming zero calories, it is said by some that they actually have roughly 1 calorie per can, so **4 negligible calories**
* Every so often, a cup of decaf coffee as well + 1/3 cup almond milk + 3-4 Splenda packets, **20 calories**
* Grand whopping total of **1334-1354 calories per day, and 140 grams of protein**

# Exercise:

* Weightlifting 6 days a week; in the gym for about an hour each workout, so 6ish hours a week. I don't do cardio as I hear it can prevent muscle growth, and even cause muscular dystrophy, as well as increase hunger. 

# Timeline:

* I've been dieting since January, and have been lifting since February of last year.

I decided to try out intermittent fasting so basically moved my morning protein shake to lunchtime, replaced my morning coffee with just black coffee, nothing else changed diet wise or routine wise. After a week or 2 of this I got really bad constipation and realised this was the only change to my routine so reverted back. But constipation won't go away and I've been living off a 50/50 cycle of constipation, laxatives, rinse repeat for weeks now. Anyone had similar? I wonder if it's me coming off creatine that may be causing it as I stopped taking creatine now also.

gl5gzu,Fitness,Any way to increase likelihood of actually feeling endorphins from exercise?,"TL;DR: Do I have to get my heart rate to a certain range for a certain period of time? Do the endorphins only hit you after months of effort? (I've admittedly not stuck with regular exercise more than a month at a time). Do I just have to except that I'll never be a member of the exercise-makes-you-high club? Please, anyone who does feel endorphins, can you be more specific about when/how they kick in? Does it actually feel like a literal ""high""--comparable to a drug? Is there a supplement I can take to make it more likely?

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if this post sounds whiny as hell but I don't know where else to ask this. 

This isn't exactly about hating exercise--I know it's not \*always\* going to be enjoyable and no one feels an ""endorphin rush"" every time they do it. At 33 I'm old enough to appreciate that sometimes you just have to do boring shit you don't want to do.

My problem, and why I've developed this complex that there's something either wrong with me or wrong with my technique, is that I have never, ever, EVER, even once in my life, felt any kind of ""high"" from physical activity. 

The best case is I do it and think, ""Meh, cool, that was a thing I did."" But the worst case is I'm completely exhausted with serious brain fog and I'm useless the rest of the day. (Seriously, how people wake up at 5 am and exercise and THEN go to work just completely baffles me). I could obviously stick to working out in the evenings, but my main hobby is writing and with a full time day job evenings are the only time I have to do it, so I'd rather not spend them in as an exhausted blob.

I realize there are other reasons besides mood lift that people exercise, but in my case I do not need to lose weight. I never have. I'm one of those lucky people who've been naturally skinny my whole life. I'm also not interested in body building, or even in how my body looks, so I don't have those as motivators. In fact, I can't come up with any concrete goals I want to work towards. 

The only reason I'm concerned with exercise at all is because I'm a nurse so I'm well aware of all the supposed reasons I should do it, and cardiovascular disease does run in my family, and my resting heart rate has always been in the 90s, which I know isn't great. I thought lowering my RHR could be a goal, but given that I'm not feeling any ill effects from it, it doesn't feel motivating enough. 

I do have dysthymia/mild depression. I haven't been on meds for a almost a decade, but this no-endorphin problem happened even when I was. And when you're depressed everyone and their mother wants to sell you on exercise like it's a fucking miracle drug. But then when I do exercise and feel only neutral to negative effects I end up feeling even worse. I've tried almost every exercise under the sun: running, walking, biking, calisthenics, weight-lifting, yoga, pilates, swimming, tennis, softball, volleyball....none of it makes me feel significantly positive after doing it. And when I hear everyone blindly say ""ExRciSe MaKeS yOu FeEl SO GOOD!!"" I just want to cry, because it feels like I'm looking through the window at this amazing house party that I can't get to because I'm locked out. I want that feeling too, damnit. I want to want to exercise. Sigh...Thanks for reading.

ETA: Ok wow this blew up! Thanks everyone who had words of encouragement. To clear some things up I'm female, 5'3, and 117lbs. Never been anorexic, and I don't have any special diet restrictions, although I never eat fast food or drink soda. My worst sugar offense most days is the one cup of coffee in the morning, though I use coconut sugar if that counts for something. Don't smoke or drink alcohol. My diet is...ok I think. I could use more vegetables and definitely am shit about drinking water. 

Fuck idk why but I almost never feel thirsty unless I've just had a really salty meal. I live in my head a lot and will legit forget to drink anything until dinner. I also don't have a great appetite in the morning so I skip breakfast. I have coffee with cream and coconut sugar and then not usually anything until lunch. But I do eat when I'm hungry. I've just never had to do anything different with my diet and I'm kind of a picky eater historically. I don't have a gallbladder so keto sounds terrible to me. I've tried other low carb stuff but I just feel hungry again an hour later, even with protein, because carbs are what keep me full without the nausea I get from too much fat.

Anyway, I appreciate all your suggestions. I'm definitely gonna try and up my water game. I figured exercise highs weren't comparable to actual drugs, but the way some exercise enthusiasts spoke about it made me wonder. I'm trying to focus more on all the logical reasons for exercise, just trusting that the enormous amounts of scientific evidence in support of it aren't total bullshit, even if my experience feels different than some. My mom has been living with us since the quarantine, and she's a HUGE fitness freak and her 10k steps a day at 63 years old finally made me feel shitty enough to start moving. She's a great coach and I'm going to keep trying till I find something that will stick even after she leaves.",2020-05-17 00:15:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/gl5gzu/any_way_to_increase_likelihood_of_actually/
g06zyf,Fitness,HIIT and the CNS,"So I have been doing the ‘Insanity’ workout series with Shaun T since quarantine started and am about to wrap up with the first month. My diet has not changed much (still eating 2K calories and hitting 1g/lb body weight of protein) and I have noticed that I have lost about 4 pounds in this month. I have also noticed that I have been extremely tired this last week. I went from rarely drinking any caffeine to requiring at least 1-2 cups of coffee to make it through the day. I have also noticed fatigue when climbing up the stairs. I also noticed that I have been sleeping an extra 30-60 minutes every night. 

My question: When people state “HIIT is very taxing on the CNS”, is what I have described about a byproduct of a ‘taxed’ CNS? Or is this just secondary to me ‘cutting’ (burning more calories than I’m eating)? What else should I expect?

[Progress pic!](https://imgur.com/a/Q3cUjBH)

Let me start this off by saying I've been lifting for around 8 years now. In the beginning, I did the classic bro split of 5 days a week, one muscle group per day. I built up a decent foundation of size and strength that way but eventually got really bored with it after about 5 years. The next 2 years were more experimental as I was playing around with changing up my rest times, rep ranges, types of workouts, volume, intensity, etc. I wasn't enjoying my workouts until I started doing a 6 day PPL routine. After about a solid year of running this, I've been hitting good numbers (for me at least) while still maintaining my weight. It took a lot of trial and error, but I'm finally happy with where I'm at so I've decided to share my achievement with ya'll.

I try to do at least 20 minutes of steady-state cardio and 1 hour of walking 3x a week.

**Diet**

I do a very loose version of IF so I'll fast anywhere between 12 hours to 30 hours depending on how busy I can keep myself. Weighing my food and tracking my calories was done religiously because I have a huge appetite so I'll eat even if I'm full. I allow myself 2300 calories a day and the macro breakdown is 200g protein, 200g carbs, 75g fat. Most of the time, I paid close attention to my weekly caloric intake. Some days I would only have 900-1200 calories and save the rest for a day I knew I was going out drinking or there was a special occasion. By the end of the week, I'd have anywhere between 4500-6000 calories to play with which was nice.

*Breakfast*:

Mostly coffee and water. I rarely eat breakfast unless I'm working out in the morning. Usually, I eat an apple pre-workout.

*Lunch 12pm - 4pm*: 

Either a turkey sandwich with mustard and an apple or ground beef with rice and an apple. 

*Dinner 7pm - 9pm*:

Baked chicken breast, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted green beans, grilled asparagus, 2-3 eggs with a slice of cheese, and soybean noodles with black beans, ground beef, a little grated parmesan, and pasta sauce. I usually skip dinner 2-3 times a week.

*Dessert* (always gotta have this):

Peanut butter and honey sandwich with an apple or whatever ice cream I got in my freezer.

*Snacks*:

Apple and protein shake with creatine post-workout. I eat a lot of apples.

That about covers everything. There's still plenty of work I need to do but I'm proud of how far I've come. Hopefully, this helps someone out there! Remember: Progress is slow, consistency is key, eat apples.

# The Journey (Extended Cut)

Aside from some swimming and soccer as a kid and martial arts for a bit in high school, I had no real athletic background and zero lifting experience. I was hefty in high school (around 200 lb), but not insanely overweight. When I hit college though, I ate nonstop garbage, drank a shit load of alcohol, and eventually ballooned up to about 270 at my heaviest in 2014. I did get it down about 20 lbs through half-assed dieting.

In late 2016, I had a serious life shake-up, went into a pretty heavy depression, and was coping with even more booze. Following that, I decided to kick the booze for one year.  Once I started feeling better, I decided to get serious about losing some fat in April 2017 and dove head first into keto, starting at 252.4 lbs. It went damn well and really clicked for me. A couple months in a started really getting into Reddit and frequented [r/keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/) and [r/ketogains](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/), which helped dial in the diet further. I also quit smoking (was at a pack/day) around this time (shout out to Allen Carr's ""Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" audiobook).

About a year later, in February 2018, I was down 40.2 lbs to 212.2 and discovered kettlebells. I was still too timid/intimidated to go to a gym but wanted to start gaining some strength and muscle. Figured kettlebells would allow me to workout at home and do it quickly. Did the basic Enter the Kettlebell and Simple & Sinister stuff, before moving to more intense double kettlebell routines.

After doing this for several months, I started reading up on barbell training and following r/fitness. In October 2018, I pulled the trigger and got a gym membership. I followed the Fittit suggested routine to the T, starting with Phrak's Greyskull LP and an empty bar. I had dropped 26.6 more lbs and weighed 185.6 at this time, less than I was in high school.

I did Greyskull for about 3 months before I started missing reps and deloading more often. I was also just getting antsy to mix things up, so I switched to 5/3/1 for Beginners in January 2019. I was *really* into lifting at this point, reading the 5/3/1 books and Starting Strength and getting a form check with a coach. Then, in May, I switched to Boring But Big because: 1) I was fully bought into the 5/3/1 style of programming and 2) I wanted to get big. I loved the simplicity and solid volume. I ran BBB for several cycles and started using anchor/deload/test cycles. At some point, I switched to the [Beefcake Training](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/boring-but-big-beefcake-training) version of it, and I've been running that until now. I also started getting more serious about my conditioning and have been doing incline treadmill sprints. Current schedule is lift Mon & Tue, sprint on Wed, lift Thu & Fri. Just tested my lifts this week.

When I started lifting, I slowly stopped being so anal about my diet and my weight has bounced between 190 and 210 but mostly hovered around 200 lbs. Guess I've been on a slow recomp for the past few months. I've clearly still got plenty of fat to lose (probably around 25% body fat currently), but I'm comfortable and allow myself to enjoy meals.

# Diet

As I mentioned, I started with keto. 1 g protein/lb lean mass, 20-25 carbs, then however much fat to fill the calories. My daily calories were normally around 1500 – 1700. Occasionally dipping lower, if I felt aggressive, or going higher during parties or holidays. I enjoyed the simplicity of only having to think about one macro since protein and carbs were always the same.

I’m a lot less strict now and it’s been weirdly fun to reincorporate carbs. Eases the guilt if I want to splurge a bit on weekends. Only real macro I shoot for is >150 g protein. Don’t care so much about carbs vs. fat but try to keep calories <2000.

I prefer to skip breakfast and eat a bigger lunch and dinner. And I meal prep religiously. Not having to think about food during the week is awesome. [Here’s a link to a couple of my staples](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ckmd1o/monthly_recipes_megathread/evss568/?context=3). Weekends are looser; I try to eat a giant salad or two and vegetarian on Sundays.

I do drink occasionally now, but knowing that I have to wake up 5:30 to head to the gym makes it easier to say no. Basically, *any* amount will make a noticeable negative impact on my lifts.

Nothing crazy on supplements. Protein shakes if I need protein, pre-workout because it’s faster to prep than coffee, and ZMA before bed.

# Exercise

* **February 2018: Various kettlebell complexes/routines**
   * Favorite/most used routines: [Simple & Sinister](https://www.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Simple-Sinister-Pavel-Tsatsouline-ebook/dp/B00GF2HP9G), [Total Tension Complex](https://www.strongfirst.com/total-tension-kettlebell-complex/), & [Prometheus Protocol](https://www.chroniclesofstrength.com/prometheus-protocol-build-muscle-kettlebells/)
   * This was my first time seriously working with weights. Loved how it felt.
   * The simplicity really helped me build the habit. The fact that I could smash through a workout in 20 minutes was great to start with.
* **October 2018:** [**Phrak’s Greyskull LP**](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/) **(**[**r/Fitness**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/) **Basic Beginner Routine)**
   * I lifted MWF mornings, didn’t go to the gym TTh or weekends unless I missed a session
   * I kept it bare bones, no assistance work or cardio; wanted to keep the time as short as possible (I was still getting mentally bought-in to this whole gym thing and was protective of my free time)
   * Since I was starting with just the bar, the first few AMRAP sets were comically long
   * Hit a wall with OHP and had to deload a couple times; this is when I got annoyed and switched programs
* **Also October 2018: 50-mile march**
   * In September, I had joined The Strenuous Life, which is basically Boy Scouts for adults. One of the optional challenges was to march/walk 50 miles in under 20 hours. For some reason, I decided I needed to do this.
   * I had no experience with this kind of endurance/distance. To prepare I went on progressively longer walks each weekend for several weeks. I also got a new pair of shoes, some back-up socks, and Foot/Body Glide to avoid blisters.
   * My wife joined me on bicycle and on the day we were planning on doing 23 miles, said fuck it, and did all 50.
   * We completed the 50 miles in 17 hours and 53 minutes. I promptly fainted in the kitchen upon returning home. No blisters though!
* **January 2019:** [**5/3/1 for Beginners**](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/)
   * Really liked the progression/style, working with a sub-max weight and learning the difference between training and testing helped a lot, reading the books got me in the right mindset
   * Still no cardio but started doing assistance work, stuck to basics – dips, chins, leg raises, face pulls
   * Pulled a muscle in my lower back while squatting during this time and got super paranoid about form/technique. Since I’d been flying solo the whole time, I decided to go do a form check session with a coach. He was super helpful and gave me some pointers to prevent it from happening again. Been good ever since.
   * After losing a bunch of fat, my main goal was always to get jacked (Thor and Captain America are to blame for this). Since I was fully bought into the 5/3/1 philosophy, Boring But Big was the logical next step.
* **May 2019:** [**5/3/1 Boring But Big**](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big) **&** [**BBB Beefcake Training**](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/boring-but-big-beefcake-training)
   * Going from two main lifts per day down to one felt weird at first but made more sense as the weights continued to increase, and I liked the simplicity of doing one main lift per day.
   * I started out still doing 3 days/week and 4-week cycles, but I didn’t like how long the gap was between repeating a lift. Around the time I switched to Beefcake Training, I also switched to 4 days/week and 3-week cycles. Lifting Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri & conditioning Wed. A light walk or something on the weekend, nothing structured.
   * No particular reason behind the switch to Beefcake, just wanted to be doing the latest version of BBB and I liked the specific assistance work it called for.
   * After dropping Couch to 5k (C25k), I started doing incline treadmill sprints on Wednesdays to improve my conditioning (sprint 15 sec, rest 45 sec, increase speed, repeat until dying)
* **Summer 2019:** [**Couch to 5k**](http://runmoreapp.com/couch-to-5k/#workout-schedule)
   * Sometime in the summer, I decided it was time to get serious about cardio. I was in decent shape at this point but had zero running experience. C25k seemed like a good beginner program.
   * The first couple weeks were miserable. Apparently, I was just going too fast. I slowed my pace quite a bit and the whole thing got *dramatically* better.
   * 2 things caused me to stop before finishing the C25k program:
      * Lifting 3 days and running 3 days was just too much (mentally/time-wise, not physically). I had a hard time staying consistent on weekends.
      * I learned more about the difference between cardio and conditioning. By this time, I was preparing for Building the Monolith; I needed more conditioning, not the ability to jog for distance.
* **Last couple weeks:**
   * BBB Beefcake Training, deload week, 5’s Pro 5x5 FSL anchor cycle, training max test week
* **November 2019:** [**Building the Monolith**](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size)

# On the Horizon

Fitness goals for the future:

1. \~15% body fat
2. 1/2/3/4 plates for O/B/S/D
3. Learn the Olympic lifts — power clean, clean & jerk, and snatch
4. Keep getting big and strong

After reading some reviews of Building the Monolith, I've decided that's next. I'm kicking it off Monday. I'm simultaneously very excited about it and slightly terrified. Since I've still got a decent amount of fat on me, I don't want to gain a *ton* so I'm going to try to eat primarily for recovery/performance.

Then in the Spring, I'm going to drop fat like crazy. While I'm comfortable now, I want to see what it's like to walk around with body fat around 15% or so. And sometime next year, I’d also like to learn the basic Olympic lifts; mostly out of curiosity.

# Random Notes & Thoughts

* As I mentioned earlier, I joined The Strenuous Life in September 2018. It’s been great to keep me active and continue my self-improvement journey. I’ve done a ton of awesome stuff that I never would have done otherwise.
* 3 biggest game changers for me: Stopping drinking booze, tracking food, and getting a least 8 (ideally 9) solid hours of sleep in a dark-ass room.
* Dropping the first 20 lbs was a huge help to my mental state and made me look at other areas in my life that I could improve.
* The confidence boost from feeling/looking better is *significant* and has helped a lot with social anxiety. Also, it’s insanely rewarding going from not being able to do one regular push-up to doing a few in the morning to get warmed up.
* Finding something that I genuinely enjoy (barbell training) has made willpower/discipline a non-issue. I don’t have to force myself to hit the gym because I WANT to go to the gym. This made consistency a non-issue as well. I've only missed 4 planned lifting sessions since starting a year ago, including when I pulled a muscle in my back during squats.
* Once you’ve been lifting for a bit, go get a form check with a strength coach. I just called/emailed a few local gyms and most offered the first session for free, even after I told them I just wanted form check. No reason not to do it!
* I don’t foam roll or stretch. I don’t do 5/3/1’s jumps and throws either. Just some inchworm push-ups, air squats, and shoulder dislocates to get the blood flowing when I first wake up, then warm-up sets of whatever lift I’m doing that day when I get to the gym.
* I do sometimes get a little frustrated looking at my lifting progress. It feels slow, especially when looking at some of the others that frequent r/fitness. I’m still learning to stop making that comparison and remind myself that I’ve made most of this progress while still trying to lose fat.
* That said... u/MythicalStrength and u/ZBGBs are fucking monsters and both of you dudes are super inspirational. Love reading your write-ups.

I've gotten so much out of others’ progress posts, I kinda felt obligated to share. Hope some/any of this is helpful! I appreciate all the help I’ve gotten from this community!",2019-11-01 13:32:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dq49yu/keto_kettlebells_barbells_25_years_of_losing_fat/
ddol07,Fitness,Barbell Complexes as Post Workout Cardio?,"Hi, I've been lifting weights for years, but just learned about barbell complexes this morning while drinking my coffee. The one thing I haven't been able to find is a clear explanation of how to use them. It doesn't seem like the sort of thing you should do as your only workouts throughout the week. So what I wanted to know is this:

**Is using barbell complexes after a workout a good alternative to traditional cardio (i.e. walking at a steep incline and moderate pace for 30-60 minutes)?**

My biggest concern with doing this would be over-training. (though my understanding is that complexes typically use pretty light weight since they're brutal cardio and you have to be able to do the same weight for all the exercises). 

Any thoughts, helpful links, or suggestions are welcomed.",2019-10-05 15:22:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ddol07/barbell_complexes_as_post_workout_cardio/
cn7xt6,Fitness,Sweating because of the carbs before a training,"So for the last 4 months I've been cutting. Because of the lower kcals and lower energy balance overall I trained first thing in the morning. Waking up, drinking about 1L of water and a black coffee and straight to the gym.

Gave my all, never sweating this much.

Now I've been reverse dieting my way back to maintenance and preparing for my first real lean bulking season.   
Because of the extra kcals I can expend now I've rescheduled my day and hit the gym straight after work. I use some of the extra carbs as a pre-workout meal next to some caffeine to fuel my session. 

This actually results in me sweating my ass of during the workout. Not that it is an issue for me but just being curious so why not post it here.

Is it just the thermic effect of the food that's making that big of a difference?

Anyone else having the same effects of a pre-workout meal or anyone that can give me an other (semi) scientific explanation?",2019-08-07 16:22:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cn7xt6/sweating_because_of_the_carbs_before_a_training/

cg9c8d,Fitness,The Absolute Beginner's Guide to the Gym,"Hello all,

&#x200B;

First, this is not a post about exercise. This is a post about going to a gym!

I notice that every once in a while someone asks a question about gyms: joining them, using them, etiquette, etc. I also noticed that there isn't much about using or accessing gyms in the wiki, so hopefully this gets added (or not, if it's not useful). If you're new to getting in shape and want to use a gym for that, I hope this will answer any questions you may have.

This is based on my personal experience, and I'm sure many of you will have ""but my gym doesn't do it this way"" comments, so please feel free to comment and I'll adjust accordingly. Without further ado, let's talk about gyms!

&#x200B;

**What and why**

A gym is a place that makes working out easier. It's usually a space dedicated to some form of physical activity that allows members to reach their fitness goals. Gyms vary quite drastically in what they offer, how they offer it, what they prioritize, etc. While you don't have to join a gym to get active or hit your fitness goals, it usually gives you access to equipment and resources you can't get otherwise (like weights, cardio equipment, pools, personal trainers, etc.). Unless you're hitting a specific exercise (running or swimming, for example), joining a gym is an easy way to get access to those resources.

Different gyms will prioritize different aspects of fitness and well-being. Most large gyms are all-rounders: they try to cater to weightlifters, bodybuilders, yoga enthusiasts, swimmers, runners, etc. Some gyms are more specialized: for example, some may have weights only. Or some might be single function (and probably not be called a gym at all): wall-climbing, yoga studios, Pilates studios, etc. What you join should depend on your goals, and this guide will cover as much as possible to help you decide and navigate the gyms.

&#x200B;

**What you would find at the gym**

**The reception**: almost without fail, there will be a desk at the front where someone will greet you and check that you're a member before letting you in. The people at the front desk are sometimes also trained as sales people, so they might try to sell you stuff, but once you're a member, they're there to help you out.

**Free weights**: this will be one of the the most common items you'll find in gyms. The most basic weight option will probably be a [rack of dumbbells](https://www.tuffstuffitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TuffStuff-Evolution-3-Tier-Dumbbell-Rack.jpg), but you'll also see free weights, [Olympic barbells](https://www.titan.fitness/media/catalog/product/cache/8/thumbnail/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/8/6/86obar-v2-1_3.jpg), benches, [racks](https://samsfitness.com.au/image/cache/catalog/atx-fs-240/atx-professional-half-rack-800x800.jpg), and all sorts of muscular [individuals](http://5stepmarketing.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gym-owner.jpg) hauling these weights around. The variety and scale of equipment depends on the clientele, with some gyms having a much bigger area dedicated to weightlifting.

**Resistance** [**machines**](https://ua.all.biz/img/ua/catalog/1949352.jpeg): these vary greatly in variety and function. Most will have some sort of weight selection, and they will mostly focus on one muscle or muscle group in the workout. While not very popular in r/Fitness, they do serve a function and are sometimes necessary (for example, they're good for back exercises). Some of them will have [cables](https://5.imimg.com/data5/FC/NY/MY-2277102/lat-pulldown-machine-500x500.jpg), some will have complex [levers](https://www.fitnessfactoryoutlet.com/images/products/12338.png), and almost all will have a small [guide](https://sep.yimg.com/ay/fitnessgiant/legend-fitness-selectedge-shoulder-press-machine-1101-12.png) on how to adjust the machine, how to use it, and which muscles it targets.

**Cardio** [**equipment**](https://www.noosaaquaticcentre.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Noosa-Aquatic-Gym.jpg): these are typically [treadmills](https://iconfitness-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,fl_progressive,fl_lossy,dpr_1.0,w_800/v1/site-51/NTL17219_gallery_1_L%402x.jpg), elliptical machines, stationary bikes, rowing machines, and other devices that allow you to perform cardiovascular exercises without changing your location. They'll more often than not be seen in rows, usually opposite the windows or mirrors. As their name suggests, they help get your heart-rate up. They're probably the easiest to use, as you probably can run or cycle.

**Body-weight and suspension area**: better equipped gyms might also have an area that seems somewhat emptier and allows for more freedom of movement, but might have a device like this [suspension rack](https://theclublg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TRX_SFrame.jpg), and might have the big bouncy balls, or thick ropes attached to racks. These areas are designed for body-weight exercises, and will often attract personal trainers or even small group classes in ""[bootcamp](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2018/08/08/5b747cf380eb35045d8b4f36.png)"" format.

**Studios**: a [studio](http://www.dancestudioforfar.co.uk/s/cc_images/cache_8440126.jpg?t=1506983348) is an area that is somewhat separated from the rest of the gym, usually by glass walls and doors, usually has mirrors on one side, and will sometimes have a stage. Studios are used for things like yoga classes, group exercise classes, etc. You might find yoga mats or exercise balls in there. Some are specialized: they might cycling studios or Pilates studios. Studios are usually open to members if there isn't an active class, and they're good for stretching or warming up/cooling down.

**Specialized equipment**: some gyms have climbing walls, swimming pools, etc. It's worth asking about these if anything interests you.

**Group exercise classes**: many gyms offer these classes (Les Mills, Spinning, yoga, Pilates, etc.). These are sometimes part of your membership, and are sometimes extra. You should check with your gym on if they have them and how you can sign up.

**Gender-specific areas**: other than the obvious ones (showers and bathroom) some gyms might have female-only areas: could be a class, could be a studio, could be a certain time in the week. If you're female and would a ""safer"" environment, you can always ask about these

**Showers & sauna**: most gyms will have lockers, changing rooms, showers, and some will have hair dryers, ironing boards, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzis, etc. These are not important to everyone, but a shower might be worth confirming if you're planning on showering after a workout. Many gyms will also offer towels (a small one to carry around and a big one to dry yourself after showering).

**Personal trainers**: as the name suggests, these individuals dedicate their time to just you in the gym! PT sessions are usually an hour to 90-minutes each, and are designed to help you focus and get better results. PTs are not for everyone. First, they're expensive. Second, they need you to agree on a predefined time and place to exercise. Third, you might not need them if you've been doing this for a while. However, they can be good if you're an absolute noob and prefer someone to handhold you for the first month or so. PT sessions are sold by the # of sessions, and can used over a specific period. Check with your gym on what options they may have.

**Chillout area**: some of the nicer gyms will have a lounge area, with coffee, a juice bar, etc. available to the members. This isn't really related to exercise, but having an area like that makes a gym more appealing to some.

&#x200B;

**Cool, sound like fun! Where do I start?**

First, find a convenient gym. I highly suggest a place that is either near work or near home; anything too far will lead to excuses for not going. You also need to make sure your gym has the equipment/timing/price that's good for you. Google is your friend (and I guess Yelp). Once you have one or two options, head down before the day you intend to start working out. Walk up to the reception and ask them for a tour of the facilities, and about their pricing options. I suggest you go the gym around the time you intend to work out, to see how busy it is. Don't forget to see the showers and lockers. Before signing up for a long-term contract, see if you can get a test run (some will give you a 3 day trial, some have one-month options). A one-month option helps you see if a gym is really for you (some people will always prefer to run/cycle/swim outdoors). If there are several gyms that are convenient location-wise, I suggest you see them all before signing any commitments.

A small note: while in general gyms and gym-goers are welcoming, some gym environments could be toxic (judgmental, show-offy, superficial). Don't be discouraged! That's why I suggest trying a gym out for a month, to make sure the environment is positive and supportive. You need to find a place that you'll be happy going to.

Second, once you've settled on the gym, get ready on the day you want to go. Wear some comfortable clothes and shoes, pack a change of clothes (if you need to change), a bottle of water, and head to the gym (I wouldn't initially worry about things like gloves or wraps; you won't need those for a while). At the reception, check in and ask for a towel (if the gym provides it), and ask for help for whatever you're trying to do: if it's weights, ask them for help with the weight area, cardio, ask for help with the machines, etc. The staff should be able to orient you and give you the basics of the gym. Ask about any special rules (use of chalk, grunting, music, etc., some have funny rules). At this point you should follow whatever program you've researched before. Remember, this is not a working out guide!

Third: shower and change, and congrats! day one is done! Keep in mind that a gym is not the cleanest of environments, so make sure you also wash your bottle, etc.

&#x200B;

**Gym etiquette**

The most important thing you need to keep in mind is that no one in the gym cares about what you look like, how much you weight, and what exercises you perform.

Having said that, a gym is a common area, so it pays to be considerate. While exercising, observe the room. See how people wait for machines to be ready, how they behave, etc. Look for signs that talk about rules (for example, some gyms limit cardio machine usage ). If you're unsure about something, ask. Unless they're in the middle of their workout, most people are more than happy to help. The gym staff are there to help, so always feel free to ask them as well.

**Weights**: if you're weightlifting, you're going to rest between sets. If the gym is busy, it is good form to share: other people can use the machines/devices/weights while you're resting between sets. Racks (squat, bench) get busy and sharing helps everyone move more quickly. Quick note: if you're sharing equipment/machines, and you're listening to music, male sure you take your headphones/earphones off so you can communicate. You need to hear your buddy. This is especially important if you're ever spotting someone.

If you're using a bench or a seat, it's good form to place a towel where you might sweat on it, and wipe it down after you're done. Before grabbing weights from a machine/bar, check to see if someone is still using them (asking won't harm). Always return your weights to the weight rack. Don't be the disruptive asshole (grunting loudly, dropping weights). If you're unsure about something, or need help with an exercise, ask other people who are not actually working out. The big buff guys are probably the nicest as they usually remember what it was like being a beginner.

Some seasoned lifters in here pointed out that dropping weights and grunting are part of the workout. That's very true, but doesn't mean you get to be an asshole about it. Is there rubber on the floor? Is there a deadlift area? Are you grunting in effort or to show off? Again, it's really about being considerate.

**Cardio**: observe the time limit if there are people waiting, and wipe your sweat off when you're done.

**Studio use**: return everything you use in there. Turn off the lights if necessary. Don't drop weights on the wooden floor.

**Body weight area**: make sure there isn't a class or someone else using the equipment. If it's an individual, ask if sharing is ok. If it's a class, either join in/sign up, or wait for it to finish.

**Group classes**: these usually need you sign up early, and your membership needs to include them. Always put your equipment away after the class is done, or wipe your sweat puddle.

c04jq6,Fitness,Switching to strength program for a cut?,"Hi all, 5'11 205lbs guy here who is looking to cut to get my body fat percentage down, have been lifting casually for a few years and have messed around for the most part. I have read that maintaining intensity is best for a cut so thought about switching onto a more strength focused program, Ivysaurs to be exact([http://i.imgur.com/SKruJBF.png](http://i.imgur.com/SKruJBF.png)). Firstly is this a good idea for a cut? I am expecting lifts to go down somewhat. I also chose it as I feel that I do need to get my lifts past some numbers which I have hovered around for far too long, this includes a 100kg bench(for reps) as well as moving past a 100kg squat into the realms of 140kg. I also wanted to get back to dead lifts and actually try and get somewhere with these.

&#x200B;

Ultimately I imagine the cut on this program will just be to adapt to it and once the cut is over start reverse dieting to start moving towards those goals.

&#x200B;

I lift firstly as a form of therapy as it clears my head but also for the aesthetics, one issue I have with a strength based program is that aesthetics don't factor in as much, is that just a load of shit though?

bwof9x,Fitness,"Lost 30kg, now wondering about losing the last bit and building muscle."," 

Lost 30kg last year with PT and calorie deficit (biiiig deficit). Went from 108kg to 78kg over 8 months and i got a taste for lifting. Stopped in november 18 and put on 2kg (back to 80kg) since. I am getting back to it now as I miss going to gym and don't want to lose the progress I've made. Plus i love the structure it provides for me.

I can't justify the cost of a PT 3 times a week to make sure I go like i was and i want to be able to do this independently.

My goal now is to lose the love handles/belly fat and build muscle.

So i have a gym membership and have started doing the PPL split from the [r/fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/) recommended routines. Aiming to do at least 3 visits a week minimum maybe more if i can fit it in. I lack a bit of confidence attempting new exercises but I'm willing to give it a go if there are alternatives. 

After 2 weeks of it, i've already noticed improvements in the number of reps (not so much in the weights yet, not that i'm expecting quick results or anything)

Am i understanding correctly that if i manage 12 reps or the max reps stated by the routine for an exercise then i should increase the weight by 2.5kg and repeat when i can meet it everytime?

Also along with this routine, i am aiming to eat about 150-180gm protein each day for muscle mass but keeping my calorie intake somewhere around 1800 per day. As I said, I really want to get rid of this stomach fat that's hanging around and I can easily drop the calories to get a bigger deficit but I don't want to interfere with the muscle gain too much either. I looked around for recomposition information a lot of what I found, I didn't find to be helpful for adjusting my current plan.

&#x200B;

Meals

Breakfast is usually banana and 2 eggs and a coffee

Lunch is usually a wrap of some kind with chicken or turkey. Or a meal prepped tub of veggies and chicken thigh

Dinner generally the meal prepped chicken and veggies similar to lunch.

Protein shakes mixed in there too with almonds, rice cakes, eggs and fruits as snacks.

&#x200B;

Slightly NSFW fat guy in boxers. 

https://imgur.com/a/ZEiP2db

&nbsp;

In early 2017 I actually was up to 420lbs (sadly I have no pictures from those days, I wasn't ahh very photogenic) and slowly without any real plan I started toward my goals with small steps like cutting out soda and cutting back on junk food and spending a little time getting introduced to the gym.  January 2018 I knuckled down and put a more disciplined routine in to effect.  January to December of 2018 I lost 107 pounds 377 to 270.  Off to a rocky start this year mostly on the diet side, but I've been kind of compensating by still killing it in the gym,  currently I'm at 245 lbs.  Lately as I've been getting lighter I've introduced some of the big compound lifts likes squats and deadlifts and it's been doing wonders I didn't know where possible on my posterior chain and general muscle balance.  Lately between compounding weight loss and muscle gain the difference I've been feeling in my overall physical capabilities has been staggering and of course, immensely motivating. 

Heres a breakdown of my routine. 

&nbsp;

-**Intermittent fasting** 16 hours fasted & 8 hour meal periods.  This has been a huge help in caloric intake management but I've also definitely noticed many other health benefits while I was maintaining I. F.  I had a very good experience using I. F. for a while and would suggest it to anyone looking to lose a lot of weight but I've had a harder time maintaining it in the new year as I've grown fond of morning coffee to help me get started...

&nbsp;

-**Weekly meal prep** with high protein, low carbs veggies and fruits.
https://imgur.com/gallery/5ZldALS
Heres a folder that showcases a lot of the meals I've made.  I worked toward a balance of nutrition but also being able to enjoy the meals so I certainly didn't maintain perfect discipline.  Always included fruit but it didn't always make it in the pictures.  This is the single biggest game changer in my routine, without my meal prep I absolutely never could have made this much progress on my weight. 

&nbsp;

-**Meal replacement shakes** for dinner. 3-5 times a week.  I've been through many brands, currently using Labrada High Protein meal replacement shakes, not the best flavor or nutrition, but balanced with price point I've found it pass-able.  Been trying to rely on these less as proper whole foods are priority but I've still found it to be a reliable crutch.

&nbsp;

-I use C4 Preworkout and Gold standard 100% whey Isolate for post workout shakes, sometimes with some fruits and stuff blended. 

&nbsp;

-5x days at the gym weekly. Usually the weekly routine is. 

Sunday: Cardio

Monday: Lower Body 

Tuesday:  Upper Body

Wednesday: Rest

Thursday: Lower Body

Friday: Upper Body

Saturday: Rest

&nbsp;

I'm not the type to catalogue workout routines or keep tabs on numbers. This means I can't accurately quantify my overall gains when it comes to muscle progress or cardiovascular health. That being said I will just kind of go through where I'm at right now with my workout routine and numbers to give you an idea.    
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Cardio Day:**
A lot of times I just go in stretch and hit the elliptical hard for an hour (heres my personal record on the elliptical atm https://imgur.com/a/x2S5QZz 
Lately I've been mixing it up using different machines mostly arc and treadmill and starting with some step burpies and high steps etc.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Lower Body Day:**
15 Minutes HIIT on ARC to warm up. 

**Squats** (Recently added this month, Smith machine, no squat rack, assuming Smith bar is 20lbs.) 
5x5 Working sets are 240 lbs, first set is 120 for warmup. 

**Leg Press** 5x10 (Dunno sled weight something like 80-100 lbs? Just including 45lbs plate count here) 
5x10 10x Plate Warmup 16x plate working sets, drop weight on last set if necessary. 
I do 5x step burpees in between each set here to try and keep heart rate up.

4x10 Superset

**Calf Extension Machine** 350lbs after warm-up set

**Leg Curl Machine** 100lbs

**Deadlifts** (Another new lift, chose leg day as upper body time table is pushing it.)
5x5 110lbs Warmup,  160lbs working sets, usually fail fifth set.  Got a lot of work to do here.. 

Thats about it, after the dead lifts I do a little core work like planks or leg lifts 3x10 and then spend some time on a full body stretching routine on the true stretch.  On my weekends(monday tuesday) if I'm feeling it I'll spend 30 minutes minutes on the elliptical after the workout as well.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Upper Body Day:**

15 Minutes HIIT on ARC to warm up. 

3x10 Superset

**Flat DB Bench Press** 60lbs

**Standing alternating DB Curls** 40lbs

**Standing DB Shrugs** 60 lbs

Usually sneak a lil super set of 3x5 Step Burpees and high knees here to keep heart rate up

3x10 Superset

**Under Hand assisted pull-ups** 55lbs of counter weight. 

**Assisted Dips** 10lbs counter weight(Recently become strong/light enough to do this w/o assistance but I find my legs swing all over the place..) 

**Ab Machine** 130lbs (the one with verticle handles ahead of you that you push forward with stiff arms as you lean forward.) 

Sneak in another single set of step burpies on the way to next super set. 

3x10 Superset 

**Rope pull downs** 60lbs

**Standing Barbell curl** 60lbs (max barbell weight at gym)

**Standing shoulder press** 60lbs

3x10 Superset

**Smith shrugs** 160lbs (my traps have been a bit neglected trying to change that) 

**Standing side lateral raises** 15 lbs (New lift, shoulders have been neglected) 

**Front plate raise** 25lbs (another new lift) 

Also considering barbell rows or maybe another back excercise?

Otherwise thats about it, I hit up a few more sets of step burpees then go to the true stretch for my stretching routine and if I'm feelin it on my weekends I'll do a recovery pace jog on the elliptical.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Every day:**  
School yard stretch routine & 5~10 minute jump rope session.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Closing:**

Right now my top priorities are weight loss, correcting muscle imbalances, gaining mobility & building muscle.  My routines tend to stay static too long as I'm a creature of habit so I've tried to develop a kind of all encompassing routine but I know how much my inflexibility is holding me back and I've been working on getting out of my comfort zone lately.

bmamh1,Fitness,Diet Review - Lyle McDonald's RFL Diet - 20 lb in 40 days,"I recently decided to give Lyle McDonald's Rapid Fat Loss (RFL) diet a try.  I thought I'd share my experience with it.  Overall I lost 20 lb in 40 days on this diet.

##**Results**

Results up front.

Before: 175 lb, 22% body fat

After: 155 lb, 16% body fat

Time frame: March 29 to May 8 (5.5 weeks, or 40 days)

[Before and after photos](https://imgur.com/vOXUoQV)

**Diet td;dr**

900 Calories per day

174 g protein per day

2 diet breaks / re-feeds per week

2 full body minimal exercise days per week

##**My background**

I've been weight lifting for the past 5 years, real barbell stuff for the last 3.  I recently hit the 1000 club with a 405 deadlift, 340 squat, and 255 bench press, as well as a 175 overhead press (my body weight!).  I had to bulk a bit to get to that goal and reached it weighing 175 lb and (according to my foot-to-foot electrical impedance scale) 22% body fat.

I've done several bulk/cut cycles in the past, usually gaining or losing 1 lb per week with a 500 Calorie surplus/loss.  So I have had prior experience in slowly, reliably losing weight.  But I've seen some buzz around the internet about aggressive cuts being better in the long run and some people responding better to them, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Plus my life is about to get very busy coming up, and I wanted to cut my body weight down before it became difficult to meticulously manage my diet and training anymore.

##**What the diet is**

I got Lyle McDonald's RFL diet manual and read the whole thing front to back, and wanted to try this diet by the book to really give it a fair evaluation.  A note here that I'm not going to describe the entire diet in full, just what I did.  If you want to do this diet for yourself, buy/acquire his manual and it'll tell you how to set up your protein intake and plan tailored to your situation.

This diet is what's known as a ""protein sparing modified fast"" (PSMF), or at least a modified version of it.  Basically this diet is ""only eat what you need to and nothing else"", which means ""eat X amount of protein and minimize fat and carbs"".  I ate about 900 Calories per day of foods that were straight protein, as little fat/carbs as possible, and supplemented fish oil for fats and other vitamins.  Twice per week I interrupted the diet for either a free meal or a structured carbohydrate re-feed, both to prevent metabolic slowdown and for a little sanity.  This diet is not intended to be implemented for bursts longer than 6 weeks without at least a 2 week break in between, so my 5.5 weeks was right on target.

This diet is intense, not going to lie.  Especially as you feel all the carbs leaving your system.  But once you learn to accept hunger as just a sensation you don't have to act on, and once all the keto bullshit kicks in, it is surprisingly manageable.  In the end, some people would rather do a very intense diet for 5 weeks than a slow meandering diet for 20 weeks to achieve the same weight loss.  Neither approach is wrong, just different strategies about what you are willing to live with and for how long.

##**What I did specifically**

Each day I ate 4 meals, spaced out at 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00 roughly.  With each of those meals I also took a number of supplements spaced out rather than take all my daily supplements at once.

**Meal 1** (240 Cal, 46 g protein, 12 g carbs, 1 g fat)

* 220 g plain Greek yogurt

* 30 g Gold Standard chocolate whey powder

* 2 packets Splenda

**Meal 2** (180 Cal, 40 g protein, 0 g carbs, 2 g fat)

* 6 oz shrimp

* Lemon wedge

* Tabasco sauce

**Meals 3 and 4** (Per meal - 230 Cal, 44 g protein, 3 g carbs, 5 g fat)

* 7 oz chicken breast in a toaster oven

* 40 g marinade from apple cider vinegar and Sazon liquid seasoning (and habanero sea salt)

* Yucateco black label hot sauce (good stuff!)

**Snack** (20 Cal, 0 g protein, 4 g carbs, 0 g fat)

* 1 cup chopped celery

* 1 cup spinach

**Supplements** (60 Cal, 0 g protein, 2 g carbs, 6 g fat)

* 6 x 1000 mg fish oil capsules - to supply essential fatty acids my body can't produce on its own

* 4 x 500 mg methylcellulose - just fiber to keep things moving

* 1 x daily multivitamin - self explanatory

* 1 x 250 mg potassium magnesium aspartate - for electrolytes

* 1 x 1000 mg calcium carbonate (Tums) - for calcium

* 1 x 2000 IU vitamin D3 - not for the diet, I just take that because it's cloudy where I live

* Plenty of salt on my food, sometimes a little salt in my water - for sodium

**Unlimited items each day**

* Water

* Black coffee or tea without cream or sugar

* Diet soda or any 0 Cal drink

* Sometimes sugar-free Jello, which I'd have on reserve if I got a craving

**Daily total**

Calories: 900 (960 including supplements)

Protein: 174 g

Carbs: 22 g (24 including supplements)

Fat: 13 g (19 including supplements)

**Structured diet breaks**

These are *important*, and necessary for the diet to work correctly.  Going at 900 Cal / day without breaks will cause metabolic slowdown after a few days.  And no matter how meticulous are are with your supplements, you're probably missing something, so it's important to refill your body.  I had a structured break 2x per week, on Monday and Friday.

**Monday Re-feed**

Over the course of 5 hours in the afternoon, I would eat ~2000 Calories of mostly bready carbohydrates (bagels, muffins, bread) while keeping my overall consumed fat to less than 50 g.  This is important to refill glycogen stores in your body, especially your muscles.  This would take the place of my lunch / ""meal 2"" so long as I got 40 g of protein in there as well.  Basically I just went to Panera to work on my laptop and kept ordering toasted bagels (no butter) over and over again.

**Friday Free Meal**

On Friday evenings in place of my Meal 4, I'd go out to dinner with friends.  One meal, in one sitting, no leftovers, but no restrictions other than ""be reasonable"".  This wasn't an opportunity to consume as much food as I could in a single sitting, nor a chance to order the absolute biggest gut-busting thing on the menu.  Just have a normal meal.  Share an appetizer, get a light beer, have an entree, just normality.  I greatly looked forward to these nights.

##**Exercise**

Despite being the gym guy that would spend hours in the gym 5-6 days per week before this, I did very little exercise on this diet, as recommended in the manual.  2x per week I would do a basic full body day, mostly machines and dumbbells, hitting each muscle group for 2-3 sets of 6-12 reps.  No barbells, no powerlifting, no big movements.  Believe me, on this diet, you won't have the energy.  Just enough to remind your muscles you still want them around.  No cardio (other than walks in the park sometimes).  This diet is not built around losing weight via exercise.

I would try to line up each of these 2 days to be on my structured diet break days (before the food).  Because after these workouts, even minimal workouts, you just feel absolutely drained.  Putting food back into your body shortly afterwards was a relief.

##**Overall impressions**

I lost a decent amount of weight in a very rapid amount of time on this diet.  The first few days were brutal, but once you get over the initial hump, it becomes surprisingly manageable.  People would look at me like I was insane when I said what I was doing, but I monitored myself carefully and the 2x/week diet re-feeds really made the difference between sustainability and reckless weight loss, at least for me.  As well as responsible supplementation.

Did I probably lose some muscle along the way?  Yes.  Those 20 lb were not entirely fat, I'm not kidding myself.  But muscle is easier to regain than initially gain, so I suspect any losses I made in mass will be regained without too much hassle.  Overall, I can see how it makes sense rather than a slow, conservative cut for 20 weeks, doing a rapid cut for 5 weeks, spend a few weeks getting back up to speed, and then start bulking or maintaining again.

Did I get shredded?  No.  It wasn't a crazy aesthetic transformation.  Going from 22% body fat to 16% body fat isn't going to get me shredded.  It took my belt down a couple notches, and now my gut sticks out considerably less.  Overall I feel lighter and more comfortable.  If I wanted to get shredded, I would probably do a second stint of this diet to get myself down to 12% body fat and then take a more conservative approach to close the gap to ~10%.  But life circumstances are going to make that difficult for me coming up.  I'm comfortable with where I'm at.

Would I recommend this for others?  I wouldn't *not* recommend it.  Read about the diet carefully, read the manual from Lyle McDonald carefully (not just a summary) and make an informed decision.  And if you do it, do it correctly.  This diet is extremely fast, and it can probably be dangerous if you try to cut weight this rapidly without doing things by the book.  It would probably be best if you have some prior (successful) experience in dieting before you try this diet.",2019-05-08 20:50:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/bmamh1/diet_review_lyle_mcdonalds_rfl_diet_20_lb_in_40/
bk7eu8,Fitness,"Been on Strong Lifts for 3.66 weeks, Actually Read the Wiki Today...","My bad.  I've had the SL app on my phone for years and a month ago when I started to get serious about my journey, I never thought to check if SL wasn't great.

So I've now actually read a good amount of the wiki, and I was hoping some of you may weigh in (ha) with some advice to a few questions:

Stats:
>25 M 5' 6""
>199 lb (90.2 kg) starting weight (Down to 195 as of last Saturday)

>The goal is to, surprise surprise, lose weight and begin building a foundation for fitness.  I lack confidence of my image and this is the obvious starting step.  I also work in healthcare so it's pretty hypocritical to have a body just ripe for arthritis, back pain, and heart problems come my 40's. My perfect body is a well defined ""sleak"" build.  I enjoy both longer duration running and weight lifting so I'll have to see where my journey takes me.

>Everyone is surprised at my weight, apparently I'm just real solid?

>I'm doing the C25k app for cardio, always a day of that immediately before lifting.

>I was in a lot of sports through 9th grade (Baseball, Soccer, Black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Swimming) but was never super serious/gym rat, so real training/working out is fairly new.

>I'm working on the diet.  I'm very much into food/cooking etc and it's going to be the hardest part (shocking, I know...).  I have, however, successfully done a few things: no fast food (besides Chipotle), 0 soda/sugary drinks for 4 weeks woot, no dessert stuff (but for a brownie on easter), upped my black coffee and water intake massivly (especially water).  I don't currently count calories but I have in the past and I'm honing in on sticking to using MFP soon.  I just try to not overeat/eat high protein items.

 I have added a few ""supplements"": 
>-the occasional Ensure/Protein drink either from work (hospital) or gym
>-one scoop (40 kcal 10g protein) collagen powder into a cup of coffee a day for general benefits to skin/hair/joints etc along with a bit of protein
>-Fish Oil Pills
>-Cayenne pills an hourish before meal


So finally the questions:

>1.  Should I start doing Grey Skull routine as laid out in the wiki?  I am supposed to work out today, so I'd really like to hear opinions on if this is still the regimen of choice for a 3 month start.  If nothing else, I'm grateful for SL for getting me into lifting, I really do enjoy it, and like I'm sure most of you realised when starting out, it's fun and not the hard part of Fitness.

>2.  I use the SL app, it's nice for recording progress/remembering the routine/weights.  Is there an app or two you guys like that would be good to use?

>3.  When I finish the initial 3 months, do I need to let my body rest a bit before beginning a new 5/3/1 or PPL?  Matter of fact is it important to take breaks from lifting routines (ie more than the 1 or 2 rest days, and just do some light stuff for a bit every so many months?  Is it a case of ""however your body feels, everyone's different"" , or is there a good rule of thumb for long term health?

>4.  I have a Planet Fitness membership atm, but I am moving to Bodyworks come July (free membership with new apartment).

>5.  You guys are great thanks in advance, once I get a plan and enact it I'll post some progress.",2019-05-03 11:34:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/bk7eu8/been_on_strong_lifts_for_366_weeks_actually_read/
bjllu3,Fitness,Regarding Intermittent Fasting and Losing Weight,"Hello r/Fitness!

&#x200B;

I've been running an Intermittent Fasting diet for the past two and a half months (used to do 20/4, but doing 18/6 now), and it's allowed me to go from 210bs to 190lbs from when I started, but I feel that I've been plateauing lately.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks I've been floating around 188-190, and I'd really like to get down to 180 by the end of the month, if not that, at least 185.

&#x200B;

My primary goal with losing weight is to reduce body fat, while maintaining muscle mass. I'm not too concerned about gaining muscle mass at the moment, although if I could lose fat AND gain muscle that'd be the best scenario for me.

&#x200B;

I'm currently taking in about 1800 calories, and my macro spread is 35% carbs, 40% protein, 25% fat.

&#x200B;

I lift 5 times a week (Mon-Tues, Thurs-Sat), with one day being my ""active resting"" day (Wed) where I do 20 min of cardio and 10 min of core, and the other day being my ""full resting"" day (Sun).

&#x200B;

I have a few specific questions:

&#x200B;

1. Will I continue losing weight if I workout this much and take in about 1800 calories a day, or do I need to reduce my calorie intake?
2. Is my macro spread influencing my ability to lose fat while maintaining muscle mass?
3. I'm still doing Intermittent Fasting, but I tend to have coffee creamer in my coffee in the morning. I also have a half serving of BCAAs that I drink passively at work. I know these break my fast, but I assume that since I'm staying within my calorie limit, I'll still lose weight. Is this true, or am I screwing up my ability to lose weight/fat by breaking my fast like this?

&#x200B;

If you'd like me to provide additional info to better answer my questions, let me know.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: What the fuck I didn't expect so many people to respond to this LOL.

&#x200B;

Since I originally forgot to put this in my OP, I'll put my personal stats here now:

&#x200B;

Age: 25

Height: 5'9""

Sex: Male

&#x200B;

After reading the comments, I've narrowed down the likely cause of my problem to ""I cheat my diet on some days so that may be fucking up my progress"". I also have a bad habit with changing up my diet a bit every week or so because I want to experiment with new macro distributions, food types, etc. I really don't stay as consistent as I make it sound.

Like I'll stay consistent with the food I eat and exactly how many calories I eat for about a week at most, but I always fuck it up somehow by the 5th to 8th day cuz I just really want a Chocolate Cake Shake at Portillos or something LOL.

I think the reason why I was able to make progress in the last 2-3 months is because I ate at *roughlly* 1700-1800 calories every day, even though I still cheated on some weekends. I really wasn't staying that committed to a strict regimen or anything. I just guesstimated a lot of the time.

I also went on a 2400 calorie diet last week or so cuz I just wanted to see if I could still lose weight at that many calories, but I wasn't so I moved back to 1800 calories about half a week ago.

ax4ew8,Fitness,How to feel energized while lifting?,"Hi all.  I've only been lifting for about 3 years, but for the first about 2 years I would feel very energized while working out and although tired and sore afterwards, I didn't feel sick.  Now for the past year or so I never seem to have enough energy to get through all of my lifts and I usually feel nauseous/sick afterwards.  As a side note, my diet before lifting usually consists of some toast, an apple and banana and some coffee.  Does anyone know a solution to this? Is there food/supplement I could take that would help?

awzrlv,Fitness,Are chest strap monitors good* for monitoring resting heart rate? (“good” not just “accurate”),"I am looking for a way to compare the different factors affecting my heart rate for a given period. 

For example, I’m looking for 24/7 data so I can compare my resting heart rate to my heartrate when I:
-have an important meeting at work
-drink coffee
-take a beta blocker
-speak publicly
-meditate
etc.

I tried a fit bit a few years ago, but it broke easily and was not good with exercise. I’m looking into chest straps but every site parrots “theyre good for exercise”, “good for athletes”, “good for HIIT”...

Every google search turns up results that fall into two categories:
1) A 300 dollar watch where heart rate is backseat to 50 other features
2) An expose on why chest straps are good for exercise.

What would you recommend for the use I described?

aoqpcz,Fitness,Cutting to look as lean as possible,"      So Just a few numbers to start, M25 6’0” 160 (as I’m writing). I’ve always had a pretty good physique. Always have been able to see my abs. At my worst I could still see top abs. Last year I started to put work in to training and build some muscle the right way. I was probably 168 when I started. Finally followed somewhat of a routine and developed a decent back, shoulders, and leveled out things in the upper half of the body. But I never really took it past some hard pumps and a protein shake after. 

     Last month, I’ve become very invested in diet. I’ve finally got my macro nutrients in place but I may be taking it to the extreme... I’ve been idolizing physique competition winners and their insane ripness. So I’ve made it a goal to cut as much of the little body fat I have to get shredded. 

     My diet right now is about 1750 calories a day. A regular day of eating this last week has been 4 egg whites and 1 yoke in the first meal, 8oz chicken breast + roasted veggies + spinach for 2nd and 3rd meals, then a late night workout ending with a protein shake I do with a banana, peanut butter and milk. 

     This last week has been the most shredded I’ve ever been in my whole life. I’ve gone from 163 average to 160 when I go to bed. I’m worried I might be losing muscle mass. So to counteract my body burning muscle, I try and work out as hard as I can. 

     Also wanted to mention this is the most energy I’ve had in my whole life. I wait tables at a French restaurant and work late long hours. Usually I’ll have over 5 cups of coffee and still feel drained all night. Since starting my heavy protein but very clean diet (which I try to eat in a 10 hour window as well) I haven’t had a single cup of coffee at work. I’ll usually just have one or two when I get up in the morning and I’ll have energy the entire day. 

     Basically wondering if you guys think I should add more calories to maybe build a few more pounds of muscle but keep the diet low carb and I’ll still be able to stay shredded. Or wait out my current diet and if I drop below 155, probably start adding back in more carbs to get back to a weight I’m more comfortable at

   Hope someone reads this. Sorry for the long post! Happy fitness to everyone out there, cheers ",2019-02-09 08:59:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aoqpcz/cutting_to_look_as_lean_as_possible/
amspkg,Fitness,Question about energy drinks,"I drink Monster Absolutely Zero, which lists zero sugar carbs on the can.  I've cut out all tea, coffee and soda and my weight has been dropping steadily the last 2 months.  I've heard the FDA (in the United states) doesn't require everything to be on the can and for myself, Keto has been working very well.  

I'm sure a few will say there are better ways to do this, buy I need SOME source of caffeine to get going daily.  I use water and crystal light for the majority of my water intake per day, but I'm drinking 3 to 4 of the 16 ounce monsters to 'get going' or wake up since I currently work 12 to 16 hours per day. 

Does anyone know anything detrimental to my diet or weight loss journey.  I have been addicted to caffeine for over 30+ years and I've completely 'stopped' twice for over 200+ days at a shot, but it takes over a full month of feeling like I can't get any energy at all to get there.  I can't do that at this time, so I'm hoping for 2 things.

1.  Is there any info people can give me about Erythritol (the main sugar substitute for Monster) I'm watching EVERYTHING like a hawk this time and I've been able to drop 27 lbs so far, I'm hoping by planning and watching as well as educating myself I can keep this going to my goal of 100 lbs gone (which would make me 'normal')
2. Secondly, if there is anything anyone can suggest to keep this focus going and to avoid plateaus I'd appreciate it as well. I have looked at intermittent fasting and it seems to help me bust through so far, but it's not a fun time.  I will be adding exercise back into my routine (slowly) starting middle of next week. 

Thank you for any info and suggestions, I'm tired of being the fattest man in the room and hope getting info from others will help this journey to actually work this time.  ",2019-02-03 19:04:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/amspkg/question_about_energy_drinks/
am5kos,Fitness,How much essential amino acids should I take on days that I fast (24 hour) and work out?,"I do alternate day intermittent fasting (water/coffee only). I am 100% committed to this--comparing ADF to ""regular"" dieting at 75-85% of my TDEE calories daily, which left me feeling hungry, weak, and tired all the time, my energy level and strength is incredibly high (above normal, surprisingly, especially on my fasting days) despite consuming 60% of my TDEE calories over the week. I don't even like to have one small meal on the fast day, because that triggers my hunger terribly and makes me feel tired. Zero food=great mood. So, moving on..

&#x200B;

I lift weights 3-5 days per week, and I'm trying to maintain a much muscle as possible over the next month while I diet (I'll be done by then). I consume plenty of protein for my size (130-150g at F, 5'6, 133lb) on my eating days, but so far in this last week I haven't been having any protein on my fast days. I'm interested in taking essential amino acids on my fast days, because having no calories, I imagine the aminos won't trigger my hunger, and they should help me maintain muscle.

&#x200B;

akl5al,Fitness,Intermittent fasting messed my eating up. Now I never get hungry and I feel like I'm not healthy,"Plus side, I've lost 11 pounds this month. Yay I guess?

However I really feel weak and I dont know what to do. My heart beats really fast and I get really sweaty in the morning when I try to get up. On the weekends I feel like I have to get up at noon just to recharge.

I dont starve myself.....I just simply dont get hungry that much anymore. Usually around 3 or 4 is when I really need to eat something. 

Breakfast is always just coffee. The caffeine alone fills me up. 

My pre workout also has enough caffeine to power me through a workout and not have me trying to eat everything in sight.

So I guess my question would be. Should I start eating more? I like losing the weidgt and I dont feel hungry. I'm lifting more and getting stronger.

For reference, I am 6'3"" and weight 221 pounds and I regularly only consume 1300 to 1500 calories a day. Usually I CAN hit this with a fast food meal a day nothing else, but I usually only eat fast food once a week.

ajd1hq,Fitness,Tea/Coffee and Intermittent Fasting,"Does anybody have an answer, with research to back it up, on whether or not drinking tea/coffee during the fasting period breaks the fast?  

I've seen people I trust with intelligent and research-backed opinions state both sides, but I can never find the research.

For example, from Thomas DeLauer:
> Creamer:  
> A “fasted state” is merely a definition of a specific metabolic state — no food (calories) whatsoever in the gut. Any food or drink with a caloric value will cause a spike in insulin because insulin is the hormone that regulates whether you store fat or release it. In a fasting state, the metabolism draws a significant amount of its energy from stored fat, any small amount of calories coming in (cream in your coffee, for example) would nudge the body away from metabolizing fat until those calories are used up. Also breaking the long term effects of a fast. By maintaining low levels of insulin throughout your fast, you ensure that the body has a chance to release — and use — fat stores. Enough calories would elicit enough insulin that fat metabolism would diminish, since insulin discourages lipolysis (2)

Would tea with a sweetner like splenda have a similar effect?",2019-01-24 14:40:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ajd1hq/teacoffee_and_intermittent_fasting/

adp0m0,Fitness,Insane levels of energy after pushing too hard,"Greetings!

I started going back into gym a few weeks ago. At first I could barely go half way through all my exercises as I would get nauseated and tired since out of shape.

Today was different.

I went hard on all machines. Even when the muscle was too tired I would push more and more for each set. And what was weird that it gave me even more energy.

I spent the whooping 90 minutes in the gym with nothing but a minute rest between sets.

When I left the gym I felt like I could run a marathon, I was skipping to the bus stop.

Several hours later I'm in bed feeling ""shaky"" on the inside, feeling hot and can't sleep from all the energy. My heart rate is normal tho.

I don't drink coffee, alcohol and I haven't had any sweets. Before bed I ate some chicken and nuts.

Have any of you had this? Is it normal when you push yourself too hard? I'm afraid my body is using up muscle to get all the energy I'm getting which is not what I'd want.

abvyy6,Fitness,15 Months Progress on Texas Method,"Hey /r/Fitness! It's the start of a new year and I also think it's time I put this program to the side and continue my strength journey with another program. I've never given a program review before so bare with me if some formatting is off. I'll try to keep this review orderly and easy to understand.

**First, about me:**

I never touched a barbell in my life until September 2017. I started college and I decided I wanted to be strong. I never did any sports prior to this and my only real ""activity"" is I worked on a farm for most of my life. I decided to do Texas Method because I liked the name, no other reason. The first day I was in the gym I just put a 45 pounder on each side of the barbel for my bench, squat, and deadlift and went from there.

**Starting Stats:**

Keep in mind some of these weren't true maxes because I had no idea where to start. All of the weight I use will be in pounds, my height is in inches.

Squat: 225x10

Deadlift: 225x10

Bench: 135x10

Strict Press: 95x5

Chin-Ups: 10 @ bodyweight

Bodyweight: 160lbs

Height: 5'9

Age: 19

**The Program:**

I picked Texas Method because it had a cool name. I read it was for ""intermediates"" but I figured any program would work for me if I just lifted heavier and heavier weights. The program had me lifting 3x a week as per here: https://www.t-nation.com/training/texas-method. I also joined a BJJ club at the same time I started lifting and have done that 2x a week since then.

The only modification I made to the program was I replaced the power cleans/power snatch with rows. (Barbell, cable, and dumbbell)

**The Diet:**

I was pretty small, but kinda chubby. I guess some people call it skinny fat. I never cared about my physique, I just wanted to be strong. I estimated my TDEE at 2300 calories and I used myfitnesspal to track my daily calories. I ate at a 500 surplus for a few months, then eventually stopped counting calories and just listened to my body for when it needed more or less food. I made sure to get 150g of protein every day and didn't focus on my carb/fat intake.

Some staples of my diet were/are milk, chicken, beef, pork, eggs, pasta, rice, and oats. I love frozen blueberries and would eat them before my workout as well as a cup of coffee.

**Results:**

I took the last 2 weeks to test my maxes, a true 1RM of various things (not just what I trained.) It was cool to see that even stuff I didn't train (front squat) was a decent weight. All of these stats were recorded December 17th-December 29th.

Back Squat: 410lbs

Front Squat: 275lbs

Deadlift: 465lbs

Bench Press: 300lbs

Strict Press: 175lbs

Weighted Dip: +45lbs for 10 reps

Weighted Pull-Up: +45lbs for 6 reps

Bodyweight: 190lbs

Height: 5'9

Age: 21

**Thoughts:**

I'm so happy I stepped into that gym. In my opinion, any program would've worked for me. I don't think I'm advanced enough to be giving recommendations to beginners, but I'd say Texas Method is a good program to run for anyone who is new to lifting. Is it necessary? No. Is it the best? I don't think there is such a thing.

Although I love Texas Method and it's done me well, it's so brutal now. The weight is tremendous. If I don't get plenty of carbs and coffee right before my workout I am done for. My lifts have stalled more, my OHP and bench are tough to move. I want to move onto a new program. I'm not sure what. I keep seeing 5/3/1 around the corner but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that or what variant would be good for me. (I only have 3 days a week to train in the gym so full body BBB or 5/3/1 for beginners maybe?)

abnos7,Fitness,"Just how ""bad"" is fast food?","Hello r/Fitness

I hope it's alright that I'm asking this, I do want to hear people's honest opinions and statistical science on this. 

I got into cycling about a year ago and have dropped a lot of weight. One thing aside from cycling that has kept me honest is MyFitnessPal. I log everything to a T, quite religiously. The thing MyFitnessPal and several studies I have read about have lead me to believe that the most important things are counting your calories, consistent exercise and having some healthy things in your diet. My day pretty much always starts with a bowl of Special K with red berries and a cup of coffee. It usually ends with a PBJ with all natural PB on 1 slice of low calorie bread, a tbsp of all natural spread and 1 cup of milk and my lunch is either a non so whey protein shake or a packet of tuna with a few triscuit crackers. This seems to have worked well for me but what always has me guessing is dinner...

Some times I will get Panda Express. I am careful about how I order. I get things like the String Bean Chicken, Broccoli Beef and switch the rice or Lo Mein for mixed veggies. I also *gulp* enjoy taco bell. I either get a power menu burrito or 3 taco supreme's (570 calories). Some times I will even get a cheeseburger. Most nights I eat things like a sub sandwich (Publix FTW) or things like rotesserie chicken with veggies. I make sure to get my veggies in. 

So, how bad is this for me? Will I still lose weight? Will I still be healthy? I usually cycle quite intensely 4~5 times a week for 1~3 hours at a time. All I drink is coffee, milk and water although when I'm at taco bell I'll have about half a glass of the Mountain Dew Lemonade. 

I know healthy food is all the craze these days. If I had more money I would definitely eat healthier but I try to work with what I can and always count calories. I just ask this because in the past 3 weeks I've only lost 1 pound but my cycling does seem to improved a bit, could I be putting on some muscle?

a505si,Fitness,Aiming to look more Aesthetic - What am I doing wrong/some help or tips?,"To firstly explain simple: My goal is to look more Aesthetic. However, progress towards this seems to be quite slow and I'm wondering whether I'm doing something wrong or if there are some simple tips to be able to make the progress faster.

&#x200B;

**Some background info:**  
I'm a 20yo male and currently a student. I'm 178cm tall and my current weight is 77.4kg on average. I've started fitness about 9-10months ago. After nearly 2 months of fitness I decided to first lose some weight as my weight was roughly 88kg at that time. I decided to follow the ''zero-carb'' diet for almost 4 months while continuing to try and build muscle. at my lowest point, close to the end of those 4 months, my weight was at 72.7kg at which I decided to quit the diet. for the past 2-3months I've been eating rather normal and have been gaining muscle faster. Although at one point I noticed I wasn't eating enough so I started to increase my intake. My weight went within the first month back up to roughly 77kg where it stayed for the past 2months while increasing significantly in strenght. However, around the lower stomach I've not been seeing a decrease in fat and it seems that the ''love-handles'' won't go away either.   
Just added info: I'd say that I'm currently somewhere inbetween an endomorph and mesomorph.

&#x200B;

**Workout schedule:**  
I try to work out 5 times a week as following:  
3 times a week I train mainly for muscle and strenght, and use a split-schedule for this.  
1 time a week I try to do more cardio and further focus on ab-exercises.  
For the remaining 1x a week I also throw in more cardio and usually train light, for more endurance training for the muscles.

&#x200B;

**Eating Habits:**  
As I mentioned above, I've stopped dieting and started eating more normal. After I noticed my weight started dropping again (it went back down to 74.8) I decided to track my calories and protein intake daily.  
Usually on the days I train hard for muscle/strenght growth I eat around 2000-2500 calories, and take roughly 180-250gr of protein.  
On the other 2 days I eat usually somewhat less as I feel less hungry, but try to reach the 2000 nonetheless. Somehow this doesn't seem to work and I usually end up around 1500-1800. On these days my protein intake is around 130-170gr.  
I occasionally have a day where I'm too busy and forget to eat and see on my tracker I only ate around 1000 calories.  
These days don't occur more than once a week though.  
Maybe also good to tell: some time ago I decided to cut out sugary drinks and alcohol.  
I only drink alcohol on special occasions, same goes for sugary drinks. Usually I either drink water, or a protein shake. Sometimes in the morning if I feel tired I take one cup of coffee before working out. (Usually I drink around 4-6 liters of water a day)  


I've heard many different opinions on whether a strict diet is needed to become somewhat more Aesthetic or like a mesomorph. But as a student on a budget and not too much time, I doubt I will be able to follow a strict diet.  


Before you get this wrong: in the past 9-10months I have changed quite significantly in looks as well as strength. I just feel like I've hit a block where my strength increases, my weight more or less maintains, fat percentage goes down, but still not seeing it in lower part of my upper body.

&#x200B;

BF: coffee and/or sandwich/muffin

Lunch: usually balanced

Dinner: usually balanced

But then crap in between.

&#x200B;

So basically no exercise and poor diet just kills me. I'm always tired and hungry = gaining weight and losing muscle mass fast.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What kind of eating habit can I develop and any exercise I get in with this type of life style. I hope this won't be forever, but at the same ""just move closer to work"" is not an option, for now.",2018-11-30 02:24:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a1o68e/new_job_long_commutes_gaining_weight_and_losing/
9yrce4,Fitness,I eat @ maintenance + now feel fatigued during workouts (ICF 5x5). Should I increase calories?,"Sup!

Been on a recomp for 2 months eating at ~ maintenance weekly (+200 workout days, -200 rest days) But i've found im now getting fatigued/tired during workouts. I was skinnyfat + never ever lifted in my life before so I chose to recomp and now I think i'm just skinny and lack muscle mass with no stomach bulge.

Im 175cm, 64kg (~140lb) and pretty much stayed the same weight these past two months with a little change to my body composition. My lifts have all improved a lot (tripled squat, doubled OHP etc) also but I'm now finding it harder to increase the weight every workout. 

Should I be looking to increase my calories? Would this help with the fatigue/make it easier for my lifts to increase?  

I get enough sleep, eat pasta + drink coffee before my workout and get sufficient nutrition (take a multivit;eat vegetables for dinner) but it seems as though this fatigue has suddenly come. I've been find the past 2 months, bar some bad days in gym which I imagine are normal

Also if I increased calories would this be a good thing to do? I now look skinny and pudgy, presumably from lack of muscle mass; if I increased calories over maintenance would I fill my body and look a lot better? Thanks

EDIT: Also just to add I am eating ~220g carbs a day with ~60g coming two hours before my workout on training days. On rest days/other days I eat ~160g",2018-11-20 11:27:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9yrce4/i_eat_maintenance_now_feel_fatigued_during/

i would appreciate if anybody can think of more questions to ask, or has links to reputable articles or studies with answers to any of these questions.

thanks!

&#x200B;

when should i bulk or cut?

(bulk at 10-12% bf, cut at 15-16%?)

&#x200B;

should my first bulking cycle be sooner than usual to make losing weight faster?

(my guess is yes)

&#x200B;

how long should bulking and cutting cycles be?

(i found answers like 2 weeks/2 weeks, 4/2, etc.)

&#x200B;

how can i get consistent measurements of body fat % at home?

(i found that calipers can vary depending on the skill of the person using them.  other devices have mixed reviews)

&#x200B;

are any routines better than 5/3/1 for beginners for cutting or bulking?  if 5/3/1 is good, which accesory exercises should i do?

(i have heard 5/3/1 is good for cutting)

&#x200B;

should i always do the same ab exercises, or is variety better?  which ab exercises should i do?  how should i progress them?

(i know and do many ab exercises, and some have variations for progression)

&#x200B;

what should i eat before and after lifting? should i have macronutrient goals for my pre and post workout meals?  should i have macronutrient goals for every day?  do you know of any good calorie cycling or carb cycling methods?  do you have any other advice for my diet?

(i have coffee with protein powder before and after.  after i also have a meal with toast and vegetables usually.

&#x200B;

what should i do before and after lifting? (foam roll, stretch, yoga, cardio?)  for how long?

(i sometimes foam roll and do jumping jacks or box jumps before, and do stretches / yoga after.  i have heard foam rolling, 5-10 mins of cardio and dynamic stretching is good before, and yoga or static stretching is good after)

&#x200B;

how often should i do sets to near-failure?  should i do that when cutting or only when bulking?

(5/3/1 tells me when to do that and i do it while cutting)

&#x200B;

is lifting heavy to near failure better than lifting light weights to near failure?  should i do both?

(i have heard lifting heavy is more beneficial for the release of hormones and stuff, but i've heard they're equally good for building muscle.  i hear lifting heavy is better for strength, but lifting light might be as good if you lift heavy sometimes)

&#x200B;

should i use a timer for sets to hit a target time under tension?

(i heard doing this can cause greater hypertrophy and i did it for a while until i remembered i wont build much muscle while cutting)

&#x200B;

how long should i rest between sets?

(i usually rest 60-90 seconds)

&#x200B;

should i ever do different methods of sets like drop sets or circuits?

(i do a circuit for my accessory exercises)

&#x200B;

how much cardio and which method when cutting or bulking?

(my cardio routine varies, but usually 1-2 HIIT per week on rest days, and \~40 mins of cardio 2-3 days/week)

&#x200B;

proper form for main lifts?  (other lifts if we have time)

9vypok,Fitness,"5 Year progress, 39 years old male, 195lb to 132lb, 5'7""","Firstly I would like to thank everyone on r/fitness for all their advice & motivation, you guys are awesome! It’s been a massive help & really helped me in my journey. Although this is 5 year progress I didn't start lifting & taking fitness seriously until the beginning of 2017 when I stumbled across r/fitness.

Although I have a long way to go I feel that at almost 40 I am in better shape now then I was back in my 20's!

**Background**

I Separated from my ex in 2013. Weighed 195lb, smoked & drank way too much. Office job & very unfit. Decided I needed to make a change. Initially started doing the Insanity workouts in my living room then progressed to cycling. Started with a low carb diet then just simply watching what I was eating. From 2013 to 2016 I was yo-yo dieting & hovered around 152lb until I finally quit drinking & started counting calories seriously. Dropped to a very low weight of 118lb by the end of 2016. I eventually joined a gym at the end of 2016. Started to lift free weights in February 2017.

|Deadlift|\-|110lb|300lb|270lb|
|OHP|\-|45lb|115lb|110lb|

**Exercises**

Squat - Really found this exercise hard to master. Started with low bar, then high bar & now back to low bar.

Bench Press - This was probably one of the easiest exercise to learn.

Deadlift - Another tricky exercise to learn. Had some real problems keeping my lower back from rounding. I have swapped to trap bar deadlifts recently as I find it easier on my back.

Overhead Press - I tried progressing on this lift too quick when I started & ended up hurting my shoulder. I swapped for seated smith OHP a while back & find it a lot more easy on my shoulders.

Other exercises -

**Training**

2013 to 2016 - Insanity DVD & cycling

2017 to 2018 - Started following a 3 day full body routine called Fierce 5. After around 3 months I wanted to get into the gym more so I switched to the PHAT routine which I absolutely loved. Followed this for 6 months & I shoved loads of food down my throat. I basically dirty bulked until I realised I had put on a massive amount of fat on. From April 2018 I switched to the Reddit PPL which can be found in the side bar & it's a fantastic routine. I followed this throughout my cut. My lifts dropped a bit which I expected on a cut. But, relative to my current bodyweight my lifts have not suffered much & I am hoping that I can get these back up now I have started eating at maintenance.

**Tips**

Don't forget to warm up & stretch. Spend the first 10 to 20 mins warming up before you dive into lifting. Forget what other people are lifting & how big they are, they have more than likely been lifting years.  Ask people if you need help or advice, most people in the gym enjoy helping. Pick a routine that matches your goals & above all else pick one that you enjoy. There's no point doing a routine that you cant stand as you will not be consistent & will more than likely half ass it.

**Diet**

I have a very small frame & my TDEE is very low. This caused a problem when bulking because it was just so easy to over eat.

Bulking Calories - 2300.

Cutting Calories - 1400.

Macro split - 35/35/30% C/P/F.

Supplements used - BCAA, creatine monohydrate.

Drinks - 3 cups of coffee per day. Probably 3 drinks of alcohol per year.

Snacks - I have been having a carb reefed once per week during my cut eating a lot of cereal & my favourite pancakes with peanut butter a jam........mmmmmmmmm I can feel one coming on right now!

Typical days eating during my cut would be:

Breakfast - Protein shake.

Lunch - Brown sandwich with 100g sliced ham.

Dinner - 140g Chicken breast with steamed veg.

Supper - 40g Peanut butter, 1 apple.

Pre workout snack - 250g Greek Yoghurt with 35g oats, banana.

My bulking days would be similar but i would add some oats with breakfast, double my lunch sandwich & add a protein shake post workout.

**Do's & Dont's**

Do's

* Weigh & count everything that passes your lips including sauces & other little things that you may not consider but they do make a difference. Get yourself a good electronic food scale & use an app like My Fitness Pal.
* Whether your bulking or cutting make sure you weigh yourself at the same time each week after the toilet. I use a great app called Libra that lets you enter your weight & it gives you an average over the week / month.
* Do include at least some cardio just for cardiac health. Your blood pressure & heart rate will thank you for it. Plus you will feel more energetic to lift. Just don't over do it.
* Do drink plenty of water & limit alcohol intake
* Do concentrate on your compound lifts, Bench, squat, deadlift, OHP. Give all your energy & effort to these & make sure they are first in what ever routine you try.
* Do pick a routine from the side bar & not try to make your own.

Dont's

* Don't yo-yo diet. Pick cut / bulk / maintain & stick with it for at least 3 months.
* Don't stop eating the things you enjoy. If they fit within your calorie allowance its fine. Even if they dont, dont deny yourself. The odd piece of cake will make little difference in the grand scheme of things & will keep you motivated.
* Don't think the more you eat the more muscle you will add. You can only add a certain amount of muscle per year. There's a lot of different opinions of this but my research suggests from the bottom end of around 10lb per year to around 20lb. This is for beginners & is dependant on diet / rest / routine.
* Don't be sacred of cutting. Keep protein high & the weight on the bar as high as possible & you will lose very little muscle if any.
* Don't be scared of a fluctuation in scale weight. You can add 2lb to 3lb over night with an increase in carbs. This will stabilize over the week.

**Going forward**

I am going to maintain for a couple of weeks then start a slow lean bulk with a surplus of around 200 to 300. I want to concentrate on increasing my compound lifts so I may drop the accessories a little. I'm also considering adding 5/3/1 BBB progression to PPL or may even switch to 4 day 5/3/1 BBB for a while & add 2 days of conditioning. My goal for the next 2 years is to add 10lb of muscle per year. I would love to be a lean 150lb.

Thanks for reading & I hope someone might get some use from this post.

9vej51,Fitness,I lose significantly more weight when I eat junk food the night before I run. Why?,"Last night, I ate half of a medium pizza (a whole pizza not a slice - thin crust cheese pizza with salami) and an ice cream bar before bed.

&#x200B;

I got on the scale when I got home, and I lost significantly more weight than I normally do. It seems to happen basically every time I have a significant cheat meal, and my run was easier too. My normal diet is modified keto, where I eat a keto-esque lunch and dinner. I usually just have black coffee for breakfast. On my normal diet days, I never lose as much as when I  have a big cheat meal the night before a run.

9v5ep3,Fitness,Insomnia Remedies Recommended By A Naturopath Orange County Locals May Follow,"By Joshua Murphy
   
   
Every night, you should get 7 to 9 hours of high quality sleep. Failure to do so may cause a number of unfavorable issues to come into being. They can be anything from irritability to elevated blood pressure. This is the reason why sleep deprivation should be managed effectively right away. Prior to placing a sleeping pill inside your mouth in order to enjoy a trip to dreamland, read on first. Below are some effective tips for sleep deprivation offered by a [naturopath Orange County](https://www.drlarisa.com/) locals may try.
   
   
 Keep stress to a minimum. Your body is not the only one that stress affects negatively but your mind as well. It's because of this why being stressed all the time may keep you from getting much needed shut eye. Other than dodging as much stressors as you can, it's also a good idea for you to partake in various activities that are proven to lower stress levels.
   
   
 Control your depression or anxiety. These days, millions of people all over the globe are battling depression and anxiety, say mental health professionals. No matter which particular mental disorder you are suffering from, managing it effectively is the secret to keeping the many complications at bay such as insomnia. Consider seeking the help of a psychiatrist or therapist as soon as possible.
   
   
 Steer clear of anything with caffeine. If you are an avid coffee drinker, then it could be the reason for your inability to fall asleep at night. Scientists say that caffeine lingers in your system for up to an hour. Avoid consuming coffee or any other beverage with caffeine in it a few hours before you hop into bed.
   
   
 Drink tea that promotes sleep. Go for a cup of herbal tea rather than coffee. You have plenty of choices if your ultimate goal is to attain much needed relief from insomnia, and some examples are lavender, lemon balm, chamomile, jasmine, passion flower and oat straw. By the way, these relaxing herbal teas may also be procured in the form of tablets or pills.
   
   
 Drink ginger tea. In some instances, chronic pain is the one to blame for failure to get a good night's sleep. One of the best all natural solution for it is ginger tea. Possessing superb anti inflammatory properties, it can fend off insomnia by easing joint and muscle pain naturally and effectively.
   
   
 Sniff calming essential oil. According to scientists, several types of essential oils are capable of promoting a good night's sleep. A few examples include chamomile, lavender, sandal wood, cedar wood and jasmine. Choose one that you like and place a couple of drops of it on your pillows. You may also mix it with massage oil or add it to your bathwater.
   
   
 Get your regular exercise dose. Despite what many think, exercising is not only perfect for those who wish to slim down but also people who like to fall asleep without trouble. Studies have shown that exercise is effective for dealing with various sleep issues. Just make sure that you avoid exercising a few hours prior to catching some shut eye.

9uuvlb,Fitness,Upping my bench press weight - Is it really that important?,"I've been having a lot of trouble upping my bench press weight even though I've been going to the gym for about two years now I have not made progress increasing weight a whole lot.

&#x200B;

I think one of the main factors might be I do chest once a week and I need to up the routine of my benching. i've been doing a few things my fellow gym goers have recommended to up weight and I wanted to make sure their advice wasn't conflicting in a place like reddit.

&#x200B;

Support Exercises:

I was told t-bar is great recently I have not done it at all the last 2 years it's new to my work out. I've been doing deadlifts and squats after initial 6 months and I've been swimming pretty often 20-30 laps in a 25 meter pool thats after the work outs. I've dropped the swimming though as I have moved to a place with no pool now I'm only doing it on weekends sometimes.

&#x200B;

T-bar

Dead Lifts

Squats

&#x200B;

Swimming Laps

&#x200B;

Increasing reps - I was told by a PT that if I wanted to do more weight I should maximize reps per set on my current weight.

&#x200B;

Original reps: 6-8 upped to 10-12 comfortably after 1-2 weeks and have been doing this 2-3 months.

Increasing weight: This has been the hardest for me to do. Even with the increased reps of 10-12 upping the weight has been difficult and I'm failing after maybe 6-8 reps with an extra 10kg on the bar.

&#x200B;

At the moment I'm doing 3x10-12 on my comfortable weight. When I up it by 10kg I'm doing 6-8x2 and tiring and scaling back to my original 10-12.

&#x200B;

Other Factors:

I'm 31 now when I was younger I was scaling weight with no problem; now 15kg on each side of the bar is effort enough for me.

I can lift 20kg on each side but can only do 2-3 reps before I fail and cannot get it up even if I take a rest and come back.

&#x200B;

Any advice would be awesome; In terms of diet I'm having protein after every work out and red meat/chicken at night.

For lunch I eat salads and fruits normally I also have coffee during the day.

&#x200B;

Please let me know if anything else is needed.

9tbvrd,Fitness,Patience is hard for me (weight loss struggles),"For the past 3 weeks or so I've cut out essentially all excess useless sugars (sweets, candy, cakes, desserts) and replaced them with fruits. I've stopped drinking soda and now I only drink water (with an occasional 0 calorie flavor packet) and black coffee.

I eat a serving of veggies, sometimes two, with every meal now. I've upped my calorie intake since a lot of people here have told me I wasnt eating enough calories (I was at 1000 to 1200 daily). I also go to the gym for chest, arms, and back workouts and I do planks and crunches at home for abs. I workout about 4 to 5 times a week. I do NO cardio whatsoever because I hate it with a burning passion.

I'm loving the way I feel since I've changed my eating and lifting. I've discovered I dont even like to eat useless saturated foods that I used to.

Problem is, I see no results at 3 weeks and of course, I internally freak out. I'm still flabby, I still have moobs and a gut. Chubby cheeks and a double chin. Its demoralizing a bit, not gonna lie.

I've been doing a lot of lifting and I also eat really well and I dont eat a lot. Drink nothing but water and black coffee. I don't eat sweets, when I feel the need for sugar i go for fruit. My caloric deficit is about 1500. I eat generally around 1000 calories a day. It's usually less during the week, I try and ""catch up"" and might dip above 1000 during the weekends. Seems pretty massive but my doc recommended it because I made it a week with no serious issues other than the occasional headache, and after 8 days I got this random hot flash where my face turned red and I started sweating for a bit.

 I also dont do cheat days, because I feel they would do me more harm than good.

I try and lift 4 to 5 times a week as well, doing exercises such as benchpresses, flies, curls, squats, and leg presses. On my off days where I'm at home, I do simple body workouts because I feel bad if I do absolutely nothing, so I try and do push ups, sit ups, planks, etc. 

I've been doing this for almost 3 weeks now and I love it. My problem is: cardio. I dont do it. I cant STAND it. I've had people tell me I should do it. I've had people tell me I shouldn't do it. I figure since I have been at a pretty significant caloric deficit for the past few weeks, I shouldn't have to do cardio and I will lose weight.

What's the verdict on this? Should I add cardio? Running is fucking torture for me. Its insanely boring and after half a mile I just want to quit. Is it a waste of time?",2018-10-29 00:57:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9s8k10/how_important_is_cardio_to_losing_body_fat/

1kzrs5v,veganrecipes,Wild Mushroom Magic - Dehydrate & Powder Power!,"Today, we're diving into the amazing world of wild mushrooms! These nutritional powerhouses are packed with flavour and can elevate your WFPB meals to the next level.

Once you've got your hands on some beautiful, safe wild mushrooms, what's next? Well, fresh mushrooms are amazing, but they don't last forever. That's where our trusty Ninja Airfryer comes in! Today, I'm going to show you how to easily dehydrate wild mushrooms and then transform them into an incredibly versatile and flavourful mushroom powder. This stuff is like magic dust for your WFPB kitchen!

Full video guide here… https://youtu.be/n0Lm1hJVn8g

Part 1: Why Dehydrate Wild Mushrooms?
So, why bother dehydrating? Great question!
 * Preservation: Dehydration extends the shelf life of your precious mushrooms by months, even up to a year if stored properly. No more worrying about them going slimy in the fridge!
 * Concentrated Flavour: The dehydration process intensifies that amazing umami flavour mushrooms are famous for. A little goes a long way!
 * Nutrient Retention: While some very sensitive vitamins might slightly decrease, dehydration is generally a great way to preserve most of the mushrooms' nutritional goodness, like B vitamins, selenium, and potassium.
 * Versatility: Dried mushrooms can be rehydrated for use in soups, stews, and sautés, or, as we'll see today, powdered for an instant flavour boost.
 * Space Saving: A huge basket of fresh mushrooms shrinks down significantly once dried, saving you precious pantry space.

Part 2: Prepping Your Wild Mushrooms for Dehydration
Hibby: Alright, let's get these beauties ready for their drying session.
 * Cleaning is Key: Wild mushrooms can be a bit... earthy. Avoid soaking them in water if you can, as they'll absorb too much moisture, prolonging drying time. A soft brush, a damp paper towel, or a quick rinse followed by thorough patting dry is usually best. For some varieties with lots of nooks and crannies, a very quick dunk and immediate dry might be necessary.
 * Slicing for Success: Uniformity is your friend here. Slice your mushrooms to a consistent thickness. I recommend about 1/4 inch or roughly 0.5 to 1 cm thick. Thicker slices will take longer to dry, and uneven slices mean some bits might be damp while others are overly dry.

   * Pro Tip: For smaller mushrooms, you might be able to leave them whole or just halve them. Use your judgment based on their size and density.

Part 3: Dehydrating in Your Ninja Airfryer

Now for the magic of the Ninja Airfryer! Most Ninja models with a dehydrate function work brilliantly for this.

 * Arranging on Trays: Lay your sliced mushrooms in a single layer on your Ninja Airfryer's dehydrating racks (or air fry basket if that’s what you’re using – though racks are better for airflow). Don't overcrowd them! Good air circulation is crucial for even drying. You might need to work in batches depending on how many mushrooms you have.

 * Setting the Temperature: We're aiming for a low and slow approach to preserve those nutrients and flavours. Set your Ninja Airfryer to the Dehydrate function. The ideal temperature range for mushrooms is typically between 110-125°F (or about 43-52°C). Check your Ninja's manual for its specific dehydrate settings, but this is a good general range. If your model has a specific ""mushroom"" setting, even better!

 * Time to Dry: This is where patience comes in, folks! Dehydrating mushrooms can take anywhere from 4 to 10 hours, sometimes even longer, depending on:
   * The type of mushroom (some have higher water content).
   * The thickness of your slices.
   * The humidity in your kitchen.
   * Your specific Airfryer model.
 * Checking for Doneness: Start checking your mushrooms around the 4-hour mark, and then every hour or so after that. They're ready when they are ""leathery"" to ""crisp"" dry. They should feel dry to the touch and snap easily if you try to bend them (especially if aiming for powder). If they still feel pliable or damp, they need more time.
   * Important: It's better to slightly over-dry than under-dry, as any remaining moisture can lead to spoilage.

Part 4: Conditioning & Storing Your Dried Mushrooms
Hibby: Once your mushrooms are perfectly dehydrated, there's one more important step called ""conditioning.""
 * Cool Completely: Let the dried mushrooms cool completely before storing.
 * Conditioning: Place the cooled, dried mushrooms into an airtight glass jar, filling it about two-thirds full. For the next few days, shake the jar once or twice a day. This helps to distribute any residual moisture evenly among the pieces. If you see any condensation forming inside the jar, the mushrooms aren't dry enough and need to go back into the dehydrator for a bit longer.
 * Proper Storage: Once conditioned and confirmed dry, store your dehydrated mushrooms in airtight containers (glass jars are perfect) in a cool, dark, and dry place. Away from direct sunlight and heat. Properly stored, they can last for many months, even up to a year!

Part 5: Creating Wild Mushroom Powder.
Okay, team, now for the really exciting part – transforming these flavour bombs into an incredible mushroom powder! This is where the culinary magic happens.
 * Ensure They're CRISP Dry: For powder, your mushrooms need to be absolutely cracker-dry. If they have any bend or chewiness, they won't powder well. If needed, pop them back in the Ninja on dehydrate for another hour or two until they snap.
 * Choose Your Weapon (Grinder):
   * Spice Grinder/Coffee Grinder: A dedicated coffee grinder that you use only for spices is perfect for this. Don't use the one you use for coffee beans unless you want mushroom-flavoured coffee (or vice-versa!).
   * High-Powered Blender: A good quality blender (like a Vitamix or Blendtec, or even the Ninja blender attachment if it's powerful enough) can also work, especially for larger batches. You'll need to use the smallest blending cup if possible for finer results.
 * Grind in Batches: Don't overload your grinder. Work in small batches for the finest, most consistent powder.
 * Pulse and Grind: Pulse a few times to break up the larger pieces, then grind until you achieve a fine powder.
   * Safety Tip: Let the powder settle in the grinder for a minute or two before opening the lid to avoid a mushroom dust cloud! You can even drape a damp paper towel over the lid as an extra precaution.
 * Sieve: For an ultra-fine powder, you can sift it through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any larger bits. These can be re-ground or just tossed into your next soup.

 * Storing Your Mushroom Powder: Store your beautiful homemade mushroom powder in a small, airtight jar, again in a cool, dark, dry place. It's even more susceptible to moisture than whole dried mushrooms, so a good seal is vital. It will last for months, retaining amazing flavour.
Part 6: How to Use Your Wild Mushroom Powder (WFPB Style!). 
Now for the fun part – how do we use this incredible WFPB flavour enhancer? The possibilities are endless!

 * Soups & Stews: Whisk it into broths for an instant depth of flavour. Amazing in lentil soup, bean chilli, or vegetable stews.
 * Sauces & Gravies: Adds a rich, savoury, umami kick to your plant-based sauces and gravies. Perfect for mushroom gravy without needing fresh mushrooms!
 * Seasoning Blends: Mix it with other herbs and spices to create your own unique seasoning blends for tofu, tempeh, roasted vegetables, or potatoes.
 * ""No-Cheese"" Sprinkles: Combine with nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt for a savoury sprinkle over pasta, popcorn, or salads.
 * Burgers & Loaves: Add a tablespoon or two to your homemade veggie burger patties or lentil loaves for an extra layer of deliciousness.
 * Dips & Spreads: Mix into hummus, cashew cream, or bean dips.
 * Bread & Savoury Bakes: You can even incorporate a little into savoury bread doughs or muffin recipes!

Seriously, this wild mushroom powder is a game-changer for adding complex, savoury notes to your WFPB cooking without any oil, salt, or processed ingredients if you choose. It’s pure, concentrated mushroom goodness!",2025-05-31 08:00:50,https://i.redd.it/vber15wtq24f1.jpeg

1j84qeq,veganrecipes,Hemp & Cashew milk (+ how to buy sustainable cashews),"I’m loving making my own plant-based milks more and more—it’s just so easy! This one, made with cashews and hemp, is packed with goodness. Rich in healthy fats, protein, omega-3 and 6, vitamin E, and magnesium. It’s ready in minutes and keeps for 3-4 days in the fridge in a bottle. I use it in drinks, for cooking, or simply with a bowl of cereal! 

- cashew nuts 180 (g)*
- Hemp seeds 50 (g)
- water 875 (mL)

Soak the cashews in a large bowl of water. If using cashew pieces like the ones I get from Umano, soak for 45 minutes. For whole cashews, allow about 2 hours.
Drain the cashews. In a blender, blend them with the hemp seeds and half of the water. Blend on high speed for about 2 minutes.
Add the rest of the water and blend for another minute. Strain the milk through a fine mesh strainer or a cloth. Store in a bottle for up to 4 days.

* I’ve been raising awareness for several years now about the origins of the cashews I use in my recipes. Because being vegan also means being empathetic—and not rushing to buy products that cause human disasters!

To recap, when cashews are shelled by hand, a corrosive substance from the nut can come into contact with the workers’ hands (mostly women). This issue has been widely discussed. Some importers (like Umano in Quebec, where I buy mine) source their cashews from ethical cooperatives (notably in Burkina Faso). Their technique involves combining steam preheating with coating their hands in vegetable oil. These standards are required by the Fairtrade label, so nowadays, harmful shelling conditions have become much rarer.

However, we’ve realized there’s a significant amount of waste in the process, as not all cashews come out perfectly intact. That’s why I buy cashew pieces—they’re cheaper and help reduce waste. They’re also super convenient to cook with and take less time to soak.

We’ve all been made aware of fair trade when it comes to buying coffee and chocolate. But the same applies to cashews—we can choose fair trade products that ensure better pay for producers.

Cashews go through an intensive process—growing, harvesting, drying, shelling—it takes hundreds of hours of labor, and that labor deserves fair pay. The worst part? Over the last three years, the price paid per kilo outside of fair trade has dropped by 40%! Meanwhile, fair trade pricing is always calculated to ensure a viable income for producers. Right now, fair trade cashews are paid twice as much as conventional ones. It’s not just “a little better paid”—it’s twice as much! That makes a real difference, with positive impacts for the entire community.

Another thing most people don’t know about the cashew industry is that almost all cashews are grown in West Africa, but many are then shipped to Asia for shelling—before being sent back to us for sale. Ridiculous, right? Why make things so complicated when they could be simple?

So, for me, buying fair trade-certified cashews from a direct importer is the only way to guarantee fair pay for producers, the most direct transportation, and steam shelling.",2025-03-10 17:51:40,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j84qeq

Any way to make the flavor more robust? I was thinking of adding some sugar since dairy milk has way more carbs than plain soy milk, so maybe it would feed the cultures a little more. I've fermented for up to 14 hrs, maybe I could push it longer? Any insight would be great.

Edit for you future googlers: I made a lot of changes at once but had my most successful attempt yet with 1 qt of Trader Joe's soy milk, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 probiotic capsules (the Trader Joe's brand, idk if it's special) and a 24 hr fermentation in the instant pot.

Plus it frees up their parents for an afternoon so they can shop for gifts or have a little peace. All good stuff, inspired a few years ago by American movies.

"," Ok, let's be real for a second. Maple syrop 100% pure it's one ingredient. 

Recipe : The ideal conditions for a good harvest are a period of frost during the day and temperatures that fall below freezing. 

**Maple syrup is made in five stages:**

**Tapping**

The maple syrup producers drill a hole 1 cm in diameter and 5 cm deep using a drill bit. It is possible to make more than one a maple tree. However, it is not recommended to make more than one  multiple taps in a maple with a trunk diameter of less than less than 25 cm. After drilling the hole, the maple syrup maker inserts a torch which allows the sap to flow into a boiler.

It's important to know that tapping does not affect the tree's health.  of the tree. It is true that, after the spring flow, a thin, long scar long scar appears at the top and bottom of the notch. However, the  wood is no longer active there. The tree fills the hole in two or three years. years. It insulates the wound and continues to grow, enabling it to live to live up to 200 years.

**Collecting sap** 

Traditionally, maple syrup producers collected sap by hand in the metal boilers. They then transported the harvest by horse-drawn sleigh to the sugar shack. Today, an elaborate system of pipes connected to the trees to each other and carries the sap directly to the sugar shack.

Today, it's an elaborate system of pipes connected to the trees to each other and carries the sap directly to the sugar shack. 

**Partial sap concentration by reverse osmosis**

Many maple syrup producers have their own partial concentration by reverse osmosis, enabling them to increase the sugar content of the sap, thereby reducing boiling time.

**Sap evaporation**

The sap is boiled in flat metal tanks called evaporators, until the syrup is obtained. The sap must be boiled on the same day as the harvest. What's more, maple syrup producers need to keep the fire to obtain good maple syrup. An average of 32 liters of maple sap is needed to make 1 liter of maple syrup.

The sap is boiled to evaporate the water and concentrate the sugar it contains.The boiling sap undergoes a complex sequence of chemical reactions responsible for the development of the unique color and flavor of maple products.The sap is transformed into syrup when it reaches a temperature of 104 C (219.2 F).

**Syrup filtration**

Before syrup can be packaged or processed into different products, it must be filtered to remove all impurities. impurities. There are two filtration methods: gravity filtration (bonnet) or under pressure, using a filter press.

1dpxuxb,veganrecipes,Why has my cashew milk watered down my coffee?,"To preface, I have never had cashew milk before (at home or made commercially) so I really don’t have a frame of reference. 

But I made some the other day and this is the recipe I used: 1) Soak 192g of raw cashews in hot water for 30 min. 2) drain and add cashews+ 1c water and blend until smooth. 3) add another 1c water and combine. 

I used probably about half the amount of water that was suggested to blend the cashews because I wanted it to be really creamy. But, I used about 4oz of it to make a latte (with espresso) and I feel like it has watered down or muted the coffee a lot. The flavor is still strong/bitter but everything else about the coffee is flat and even tastes a little watery. I usually use chobani extra creamy oat, so that’s what I’m comparing it to, which really boosts and enhances the espresso. Am I doing something wrong w the cashew milk or is this just how it is? I know commercial oat and homemade cashew are completely different, but just looking for some insight here, as I would be primarily using this for coffee. TIA!!

1d9g3yc,veganrecipes,Looking for breakfasts with 20g of protein that are not oats,"Hey! I try to get 20g of protein per meal. I used to do overnight oats for breakfast but due to recent events in my life the oats are not appetizing anymore. So I am looking for other ideas.  Please do not come at me about how people don't actually need that much protein, I feel my best when I get at least 60g a day, and I work an extremely active job.

Qualifications:
-under about 400 calories per meal
-will keep me relatively full until noon. I work an extremely active job and while I can top up with some fruit or something on break, I need to have a good foundation for the morning.
-not crazy expensive
-Ideally no real cooking required morning of. I have the time but I am not a human in the morning so I try not to turn on the stove 😅
-I also drink cold brew coffee, so some of the protein could be hidden in the coffee, but I tried mixing protein powder in and it was gross.

Some ideas for current breakfast items to upgrade:
-wasa cracker with pb and agave nectar
-breakfast sandwiches-current situation (English muffins, homemade or impossible breakfast sausage, Chao cheese, folded just egg) only gets to 10g protein by the time it hits the calorie cutoff. This is probably the best option to upgrade but stuck on ideas.

I also usually eat some fresh veggies and/or fruit with breakfast with the goal of upping the fiber content to make me feel fuller longer. I do not include this in the calorie count.

I am an avid home cook so really any recipe is doable, as long as it can be prepped ahead of time.

Thanks for any suggestions!

194r5io,veganrecipes,Can I salvage my homemade coconut yogurt?,"I followed a simple recipe I found online in order to make my own vegan yogurt substitute using just coconut milk and probiotics. The instructions said to cover it with cheesecloth and keep it at above 75 degrees for 48hours. I didn’t have cheesecloth so I used a coffee filter. Well, I didn’t check it and ended up leaving it out for about 60 hours instead of 48. Maybe a little less, but around there. It is SO sour.

There’s no mold and it doesn’t smell bad (just a little …like, yeasty? Fermented, I guess?)  It’s been in the fridge since and I’m just wondering if there’s a way to lessen the sourness with sugar or something. I wanted to use it to make dips for my chickpea potato patties. One would be a green chutney and the other a tahini-based dip, but I don’t want to use other ingredients to flavor it if the sourness will overpower everything else.   


So, my questions are:

1. Is it safe?
2. Can I mellow the sourness?
3. Is there any use outside of dips it might still be good for?

Thanks in advance!

Recipe I used: [https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-2-ingredient-coconut-yogurt/](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-2-ingredient-coconut-yogurt/)

Update!: the dips actually turned out pretty great. Props to the person who said I could forgo the lemon juice. I mixed one dip up with sesame oil and honey as an experiment and it was actually pretty nice. 
What didn't work out was the chick pea patties. Maybe I didn't make them correctly as they were falling apart even after cooling. But outside of the texture/looseness of them, they just didn't have much flavor to me.
I only made a quarter batch before deciding I needed to figure something else out. I don't have a refined or sensitive palette so it might just be me and not the recipe. 

I did salvage the mix (for my tastes) by adding aquafava and olive oil to get it to stick together a bit better, plus curry powder, garam masala, smoked paprika, cumin, and salt. Then I baked them instead of frying. They came out...  Well, I'll be honest. They looked like hockey pucks but they actually tasted really good with the dips.
Not a recipe I'd publicize but they'll all get eaten now and that wasn't the case before. ",2024-01-12 09:33:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/194r5io/can_i_salvage_my_homemade_coconut_yogurt/

1. Brew a strong cup of coffee using a French press. Allow it to cool slightly.

2. Substitute the ham with vegan ham, smoky tempeh strips, or mushrooms.

3. Sauté your vegan substitute in a pan with a bit of oil until it's nicely browned.

4. Remove the substitute from the pan and deglaze the pan with the cooled black coffee. Scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any bits stuck to the bottom.

5. Add a splash of soy sauce or tamari for umami, and a bit of maple syrup or your preferred sweetener to balance the bitterness of the coffee.

6. Simmer this mixture until it reduces to the consistency you like.

7. Adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper, then serve your gravy over vegan biscuits, grits, or alongside your vegan protein.

14oqpdv,veganrecipes,Vegan mayo with soy lecithin granules instead of soy milk?," 

Hey everybody,

I love making mayo, and have used whole eggs for a long time before I went vegan. Since then I tried to make it work with aquafaba and soy milk, which generally went great - however, both these ingredients pose a practical problem for me.If I want to use aquafaba I have to either use up a whole can of chickpeas everytime I want to make mayo (or at least use it up at a reasonable time after opening it). Health wise that would probably be an advantage, kind of forcing me to incorporate more legumes into my diet, but its just kind of impractical. The other option would be to get separated aquafaba at a store, but even then I'm not sure about how long I could store that in the fridge.The soy milk option gives me better results. Unfortunately I prefer oat milk for any other situations (e.g. in coffee), so I can't effectively use up a whole carton of soy milk unless I make tons of mayo.

Since there is no pulverized soy milk available yet (like with oat milk), I thought about using soy lecithin granules from the drug store, so I could just take the amount I need for a batch of mayo and then easily store the rest. However, with these granules I've had nothing but failures yet.My recipe so far was mostly about a Tbsp of lemon juice, a Tbsp of mustard, somewhere between 3 and 5 g of soy lecithin granules, salt and pepper and about 200 ml of granola oil. Mixing up all ingredients except for the oil first, then adding the oil and blending it with an immersion blender (sticking it right down a narrow beaker, then going full blast and slowly lifting it up).

The results so far reminded me of how regular egg yolk mayo breaks when you pull up the immersion blender too quickly (or if using a whisk: adding oil too quickly). Its just a greasy mess, with air bubbles quickly emerging from the liquid.

Have any of you tried making vegan mayo with soy lecithin granules instead of soy milk/aquafaba? Is there something like a conversion chart for X g soy lecithin granules equals one regular egg yolk for example?

Edit: I have looked for what seemed like an eternity for me so find info on this on google, but so far the only recipe even mentioning soy lecithin I could find was from [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-vegan-mayo-aquafaba-recipe-vegan-experience), and he just mentioned some sprinkles to help an already prepared vegan mayo to keep its shape/consistency. I don't know if he is using granules or a more pure powder, though.

Thanks for your input and happy cooking!",2023-07-02 15:12:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/14oqpdv/vegan_mayo_with_soy_lecithin_granules_instead_of/

I usually do some almond or oat milk with both my black tea and coffee, and add sugar/syrup to my coffee most of the time.  I know black coffee is healthiest, but I’m working my way there.

I also just started drinking MUD\WTR, and I have to say, I’m really liking the energy I get from it. The taste isn’t bad, and I get some crumbs now and then, but it’s pretty good for a morning drink before work.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I’ve switched from brands like silk, califia farms, and Oatly to the Elmhurst brand.  It seems like most of the vegan/non-dairy milks on the market have so many other ingredients like vegetable oil.   But there’s a few brands like Elmhurst that are just straight up almonds, oats, cashews, etc.  So if you’re looking for a healthier option try another brand where the ingredients are just the oat/nut and water.",2023-05-02 00:23:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/13563qy/coffeeteabrew_people/

For years I've tried different hot cocoa recipes. But this recipe is the best I have ever made. Enjoy!

&#x200B;

Ingredients

    ▢ 6 ounces (170g) 70% dark chocolate, chopped
    ▢ 4 cups (960 mL) oat milk (or soy milk)
    ▢ 1 (13.5-ounce/400 mL) can of vegan coconut milk*
    ▢ 1/4 cup maple syrup (80g) or organic cane sugar (50g), plus more to taste**
    ▢ 2 teaspoons espresso powder or instant coffee powder (optional)
    ▢ ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
    ▢ 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract***
    ▢ 1/2 cup (48g) Dutch process cocoa powder****

Instructions

\-Add oat milk and coconut milk to a 4-quart / 4L (or larger) saucepan. Add chopped chocolate, maple syrup or sugar, espresso (if using), salt, and vanilla.

\-Use a mesh sieve sift the cocoa powder into the pan. Sifting removes the clumps.

\-Simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, whisking occasionally til the hot chocolate has slightly thickened.

\-Cool for 5 to 10 minutes",2023-04-26 22:48:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/1302986/best_hot_cocoa_ever/
1hi32v9,gainit,"3 Yrs, 170 -> 195, Recently decided to get big","28 years old, weigh 195lbs now. First pic Jan 2022, 170lbs.

History/goals: Trained like a powerlifter for the longest time and just wanted to get strong but stay lean. Then a few months ago I hurt my shoulder and couldn’t bench anymore, so I decided I just wanted to get absolutely massive (and stay lean if possible of course).

Training: Still squatting big, currently doing the Russian Squat Program and it’s going fantastic. Trying to learn how to train upper body like a bodybuilder since this is new to me (watching a lot of Jeff Nippard he’s my fav). Still figuring out a split but putting extra emphasis on side delts and biceps since I feel they’ve been neglected. Almost never train abs. Sometimes do cardio (rower) but I’m fairly active and it’s ski season so it’s really hard to fit that in right now.

Diet: relatively clean but a little inconsistent. I try to mostly align with whole30 (mostly meat and veggies) but I also allow myself the carbs (bread/pasta). Rarely drink alcohol. Coffee before workouts. Casein shake before bed.

This is really my first ever round of progress pics (intentionally at least), would love some suggestions on what I may need to work on the most. Thanks!",2024-12-19 21:04:47,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hi32v9
1bnhgr4,gainit,Pre-workout for the evenings?,"I tend to work out in the evenings (5pm or so). I've taken pre-workout in the past, but it was 3 or 4 years ago when I was working out in the mornings so it's hard for me to remember how it really affected me. I know it definitely helped my workouts though.

Anyways, I'm considering taking it again before my workouts but now I workout in the evening. I don't really love to have a ton of caffeine that late, I stop drinking coffee around 3 or 4pm. 

Is there a pre-workout that doesn't contain a huge dose of caffeine? Would the caffeine in a pre-workout affect me differently than coffee? Is there any point to taking a pre-workout without caffeine?",2024-03-25 16:08:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1bnhgr4/preworkout_for_the_evenings/
1985ucp,gainit,"Zero appetite, I force myself to eat and feel bad physically","22M, 180cm 56kg

I cant eat anything, I cant finish my meals, sometimes I barely can eat 2 meals per day, sometimes less than that. If I force myself to finish the meal I feel like my stomach is full and I struggle a lot.

All my blood tests are fine, no thyroids, no other suspicious things related with my lack of appetite, all vitamins look good.

I consume B12 and multivitamins daily basis.

I go to gym every 2 days.

I only drink one cup of coffee per day, and sometimes dont.

I tried many diets, went to several very professional doctors multiple times, nothing useful found that explains why I cant gain weight.

I used antipsychotics for a while during my high school days for years, and those pills make people gain more than 50kg. Even company got sued multiple times and wasted billions to customers to pay up fines because of that (it makes people diabetic and increases appetite very significantly). During 3 years I barely managed to gain 10kg and reached 61kg or so, from 51. Which means I cant gain weight when I eat a lot too.

I never used suspicious products, always tried to gain weight in healthy manner, slowly and steady. But nothing works.

Im not looking for solution, I understand that is issue likely is related with something going on with my body. But I cant convince my doctors that this is an issue. They just say ""metabolism"" or ""you are just like that"".

Any hints where should I look for? Which doctor I should see? Which tests I should do?

11ddesf,gainit,I will start working out next week and here is my plan for the next year of bulking. What do you think?," I am 21M, 5’7 and weigh about 123 pounds. I am really skinny. I have worked out in the past but always end up quitting because of my inability to eat so much food. However, I want to change this. I want to get bigger. Here is the plan.

Workout

3 days a week.

Deadlifts: 3 sets, 8-12 reps

Squats: 3 sets, 8-12 reps

Pull ups: 3 sets, 8-12 reps

Push ups: 3 sets, 8-12 reps

Dumbbell rows: 3 sets, 8-12 reps

Dips: 3 sets, 8-12 reps

I will do progressive overload. Whenever I am able to do 12 reps, I will up the weight.

Diet

This will be the hardest part

Breakfast- Coffee, and a 900 calorie oatmeal bowl

Lunch- Rice and chicken

Dinner- Chicken sandwich, a fruit cup.

Snacks: Peanuts, protein bar.

And I also plan on drinking a 2000 calorie shake I found on YouTube throughout the day. It contains ingredients like peanut butter, choclate milk, mcp oil, protein powder and chocolate. 

I also plan on taking one scoop of creatine a day.  

I will bulk until I reach 160 pounds, then cut.",2023-02-27 14:40:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/11ddesf/i_will_start_working_out_next_week_and_here_is_my/

111oho2,gainit,"Try It Before You Ask About It; Or, Why ""Fuck Around and Find Out"" Beats Fuckarounditis Every Time","Friends, I would like to humbly suggest something. If you get an idea--especially an idea along the lines of ""what if I do X every day?""--go ahead and try it. At least once.

It's pretty common around here for people to ask whether it's okay to eat 1,000 calories of peanut butter every day, or whether the lifting routine they just wrote is any good. There's nothing wrong with being curious about these things. But then what happens when you ask?

Well, usually you'll get answers. The answers might be things you don't like, such as ""your program sucks"" or ""that's too much peanut butter."" And then you'll start arguing that, actually, your two hours of googling made you an expert in program design. Or that you have digestive issues that prevent you from eating your last 1,000 calories of the day as anything other than peanut butter. But if you knew this routine or this diet was the perfect one for you, why did you bother asking? You could have just slurped down your peanut butter without telling a soul.

## Asking is preparation but also avoidance

There is a way that psychologists think about behavior change. Before you start doing a new thing (such as going to the gym or eating more), there is a ""contemplation"" stage. In this stage, you haven't fully committed to doing the thing and you may not really understand how to do it, but you're researching and considering your options. Talking out your options with other people is a part of this stage. It is good and healthy to move through this stage.

But you can't stay here forever. It's like meeting someone online: you're not actually dating if you just text them for weeks on end. You have to eventually meet them for coffee or whatever and see what they're like. Are you really still contemplating, or are you just afraid to take action?

Call your own bluff and *actually eat the peanut butter.* If you think you can stomach a jar a day, open up the jar right now and see how many spoonfuls you can get down. If you want to do the One Punch Man workout every morning, get down on the floor and see what it's like to do those 100 pushups. **The first step toward doing something every day is finding out whether it's possible to even do it once.**

## How to properly fuck around and find out

This is the scientific method, folks. To be clear, you do not need to figure everything out yourself. The entire point of the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index/) is that we have a list of pre-vetted programs, and some tips on nutrition. You can search the archives for program reviews and success stories. It is totally fine to [copy the smart kid's homework](https://purplespengler.blogspot.com/2019/05/copying-smart-kids-homework.html), as they say.

But you have a question that isn't answered in the wiki, or you don't like the answer. So, should you ask a question or should you fuck around and find out? Well, consider how you'll react to someone telling you that your idea is not good, actually.

* If you would listen to them and consider changing your course of action, congratulations! You have a real question and you should ask it.
* If you would argue that no AKSHUALLY your plan is good, then STOP. Do not ask the question. Go find out for yourself.

It is very important that you *not* spend all day arguing on the internet about the thing you're about to do. Yes, this may serve to get you psyched up about it and determined to prove everybody wrong. But in the meantime, you are wasting *everybody else's* time. They think they are helping you. You are merely using them for motivation. Put on some pump-up music instead and give yourself a pep talk in the mirror.

Here is what you do.

1. You decide on your plan for doing the thing.
2. You do the thing.
3. You document your results. Did you stop after three spoonfuls of peanut butter? Or did you eat the whole jar and feel great, and eat another one the next day?
4. If your results are noteworthy, make a thoughtful post and tell us about it!

Note that this works particularly well with homebrew workout routines. It breaks my heart that **so many people post ""How is my original workout routine?"" but nobody posts ""Results from my original workout routine which I actually did for 12 weeks.""** Tell us about it! Contribute to society!!

xotx1h,gainit,"If You Struggle with a Low Appetite, this Could be a Game Changer.","Here’s a powerful tip yall, if you struggle with a low appetite and are looking to gain weight, seriously consider removing stimulants from your diet: mainly caffeine  (coffee, tea, energy drinks) and theobromine (dark chocolate). 

I used to intermittent fast by skipping breakfast in the morning. What I’ve noticed is that when I drink black coffee, fasting is a breeze: I feel no hunger at all until about noon. On days when I try to fast without coffee, the hunger and low energy are almost unbearable. I’ve noticed the same with dark chocolate as well.

I know giving up coffee is one of the hardest dietary changes you can make. Personally, coffee used to be the one thing I looked forward to most in the morning. It is really tough. But since quitting, I’ve noticed a massive increase in my appetite. Now, I can power through five meals a day no problem.

So should I take pre workout only on leg days?


Is it true that the body gets used to pre workout and if I stop taking it , it'll make me lazy to workout?


Also what are the precautions if I do consume it, like drinking a lot of water etc.

&#x200B;

Reflecting on what's kept me a spooky skeleton for decades, some of the following come to mind. Please add yours since we all find it hard to reflect & identify our habits that keep us behind.

&#x200B;

Eating more than average, one day a week, feeling stuffed, and thinking I eat a lot all the time.

Skipping breakfast a day or more a week cos you can tolerate the hunger easily, or just don't want to roll out of bed

Eating less in a meal because the taste didn't hit the spot

No snacks between meals at all even if hungry - just wait till the meal.

Staying dehydrated i.e. drinking less than a liter of water a day (incl all liquids)

Ending meals while still a little hungry since that's supposed to be good for you

Eating heavy for a meal and then skimping on the next 2 because your stomach is full

Substituting a meal with a coffee/tea while in a hurry (or being lazy)

Ordering a little less at a restaurant, just to make sure there are no leftovers or food waste

whuk9u,gainit,how to help someone with autism who hates eating gain weight?,"My little bro (mid 20s) desperately wants to gain weight but eating feels like torture to him. He finds most foods disgusting and even the ones he does like he doesn't seem to have an appetite for. 

All he wants to do is play video games all day and eating for even 15 minutes takes away from his game time so he just doesn't do it and will have a meltdown if he has to stop playing. 

As a result, he is more than 30 lbs underweight and hates the way he looks so much he is afraid to leave the house. He is an adult, so I can't force-feed him (nor would I want to do that to him). He drinks a lot of coffee and will not budge on that even though he knows it's an appetite suppressant. I'm afraid he's going to have a heart attack because of the caffeine use and because he's so underweight. 

He hates most calorie dense foods. He won't eat pasta or mac and cheese. He finds nutella nausea-inducing. Trying to get him to eat any vegetables is a lost cause. About all he'll eat are bean burritos without any sauces. He'll also occasionally eat cheese burgers without any sauces or vegetables. But, even then, he'll let his food sit there and get cold while he plays his game and so he ends up taking just two bites out of his meals and then either throwing them away or putting them in the fridge until they either go bad or I end up eating the leftovers. 

I know that they use weed to help cancer patients eat and weed is legal where we are but I know nothing about drugs so I wouldn't even know what to get him to help him develop an appetite. I guess my questions are:

1. What are some calorie dense foods that won't make him feel full immediately?
2. What kind of weed products will help him to develop an appetite? (He is of legal age to do this and interested in trying it for weight gain purposes.) 
3. What are some calorie and nutrient dense ingredients that can be added to his food (or even his coffee--though he refuses to drink sweetened coffee or milky coffee) that can help him to gain weight without tasting gross to him? 
4. Are there any low-effort high-calorie foods that picky eaters can make on their own (he has a normal IQ but he won't prepare any food that requires him to stop playing his game for long)?

vxfney,gainit,THE HOLY TEXT AND PATRON SAINTS OF R/GAINIT: 3 GREAT ARTICLES AND 2 EXAMPLES TO GUIDE YOUR GAINING,"Greetings Once Again Gainers,

**INTRO**

* I’ve noticed that, over the past several months, I keep linking the same 3 articles and referencing the same 2 individuals when it comes to go to examples of “How to Gain” such that I felt it was necessary to gather it all in one spot for the sake of easy consumption.  And, fun fact about me: I have 8 years of formal theology education along with a minor in philosophy, which tends to color how I view the world.  As such, I thought it’d be interesting to shape it in the paradigm of Catholicism.  Please don’t let that dissuade you if religion isn’t your jam: this is all for funsies.  First, I’ll start with the Holy Scriptures, then move on to the Patron Saints. 

* Without further ado…

**THE OLD TESTAMENT: “HOW TO STAY SMALL AND WEAK” BY CHASE KARNES**

* [CLICK HERE FOR THE LINK TO THE ARTICLE]( https://www.elitefts.com/education/novice/how-to-stay-small-and-weak/)

* Folks, this is THE article.  It’s not the oldest of the group I am going to share, but as far as The Genesis of r/gainit goes, you could do no better.  Chase directly calls out all the things that small and weak trainees do to STAY small and weak, and gives guidance on how to correct it.  Much like the 10 Commandments or the 7 Deadly Sins (the latter of which are actually NOT Biblical text, but I digress), you’ve got your “thou shall nots” spelled out right here.  In fact, let me do that, so you have an idea of what is contained within.

* **“Buy the Newest, Latest, and Greatest Supplement”**
* > This is key. You see, the biggest, strongest guys in the world have found the one secret supplement that makes you 10,000-percent more anabolic and unlocks your growth potential through a magical mechanism that’s only been done in Belgian blue bulls. If this one doesn’t work for you like it did for the guy who is pictured in the ad, then it isn’t your magic supplement. Turn the page and find the new preworkout that gives skin-tearing pumps and contains a key ingredient that is one molecule away from pure methamphetamine. If you follow it up with their post workout formula, the protein and special super-secret patented carbohydrate combination will go straight to your muscles and add up to 150% more muscle than eating the same amount of protein and carbohydrates in a meal.
* **” Follow the Insanely High-Volume Training Programs, Training Multiple Days a Week”**
* >Because your base of strength is so low as a beginner, we want to make sure we are doing enough volume that you are forced to use even lighter weight. We don’t want any adaption response from the body getting bigger or stronger; we just want to burn a ton of calories and get a sweet pump. We want to do stuff like hit failure on incline dumbbell presses on our drop sets that start with 30-pound dumbbells and end with 15-pound dumbbells. Why train three days a week if you can train six days a week? We don’t want to have time to rest and recover, and we want to keep burning maximum calories, because burning calories is trendy.
* **” Eat like a Pre-Contest Bodybuilder Year Round”**
* >This diet is key to staying small and weak. You should only eat egg whites, chicken, broccoli, tuna, brown rice, sweet potatoes, and protein powder. Carrying around a gallon jug of water is optional but recommended. You definitely don’t want to take in many carbs and should keep calories low. You can have a cheat meal once every 14 days — but be careful here as well. We are trying to stay below maintenance on calories. Carry your meals around in plastic containers. If you can stay hungry all the time, this is even better. https://www.elitefts.com/education/training/powerlifting/overcoming-the-pressure-of-a-six-pack-how-i-gained-100-lbs-in-high-school/
* **” Obsess over Always Needing to See Your Abs”**
* >To stay small and weak, your abs must always be visible. Every single day of the year, you need to look at your abs in the mirror to make sure that they are still there. If they start to look less crisp or a little soft, you must immediately pull some carbs out of your diet. We can’t have you getting any bigger or stronger.
* Don’t just read these wavetops!  The whole thing is gold.  No joke: I started training in 1999.  If ALL I had was THIS ONE article, I would have been LEAPS AND BOUNDS ahead of where I am today.

**THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS: “Overcoming the Pressure of a Six-Pack: How I Gained 100 lbs in High School” by Charles Fay**

* [Click here to read the article]( https://www.elitefts.com/education/training/powerlifting/overcoming-the-pressure-of-a-six-pack-how-i-gained-100-lbs-in-high-school/)

* This is something of a lost article.  I discovered this back in 2008, when I no joke read every single article on Elitefts (at the time, not nearly as significant an undertaking as it would be today, but still a fair bit of reading).  This one always stuck with me, and doesn’t seem to get nearly enough love.

* With so many gainers being of high school age, this article is just absolutely perfect for them.  There is NO BETTER AGE to gain than high school.  There’s a fair chance your meals are provided for, cooked for you, cleaned up after you, etc.  You have minimal obligations (yes yes, I’m sure school, sports and social life is tough: just wait until you have to MANAGE that for another human as a parent AND still have your own work, school and social life, haha), and your body is primed to grow.   You can use this opportunity to lay down an incredible foundation of size and strength, or a noteworthy physique, OR simply just not be a skeleton.

* Not as instructional/informative as the Chase Karnes article, but VERY demonstrative.  The author does a fantastic job explaining the benefits of weight gain, the dedication required to achieve it, the positive outcome, and how he personally pursued it.

* A fantastic read to help keep “vector checked”.  As Dan John says “The goal is to keep the goal the goal”.

**THE GOSPEL AND REVELATIONS: “EATING THROUGH THE STICKING POINTS” by Matt Reynolds**

* [Click here for the article]( https://startingstrength.com/article/eating_through_the_sticking_points)

* We’re making this the Gospel and Revelations because it’s going beyond the Old Testament here.  At this point, you’re bought in and looking to REALLY benefit from gaining it. 

* In this article, Matt Reynolds (himself an accomplished strength athlete) is employing a strategy taught to him by Hugh Cassidy, one of the OG Godfathers of powerlifting who learned the value of increasing bodyweight for the sake of increasing weight lifted in competition.  If Hugh ran into a sticking point, his solution was to eat through it.
  
* Spoilers: it worked.  It ALWAYS works.  SO many gainers need to learn and appreciate that, because SO many questions regarding stagnation in training boil down to stagnation in bodyweight gained.  We frequently see posts asking “How do I increase my bench 50lbs in 8 weeks”, and these same individuals scoff when the solution is given “try to gain 30lbs of bodyweight”.  Weight moves weight.

* Key takeaways here are the prodigious amounts of food consumed in order to achieve these goals, along with the ability to drop the fat once the gain was done.  Examples include

* >A pan of cake or brownies a day for a month

* >Two boxes of Kraft Mac & Cheese and two cans of tuna in one sitting, which provided 2500+ calories and tons of protein for under $5.

* >Family size Pizza Hut’s creamy chicken alfredo Tuscani pasta 4 times a week

* >20 Jack in the Box tacos, each covered in buttermilk ranch dressing

* The author acknowledges that many of these choices aren’t considered healthy, but this is, again, a good vector check.  The goal wasn’t maximized health: it was maximized poundages.  This was a short, shotgun blast of a diet to reach that goal, and it worked.  Extreme measures are often needed for extreme goals.

* Now let us discuss 2 fantastic examples of gaining it.  Randall is a bodybuilding throwback from way back in the day, while Blakely is still alive, well, and making the rounds on the internet.

**BRUCE RANDALL**

* [An after and before photo](https://i.imgur.com/yUJ9bvC.png)

* [His story](https://www.chaosandpain.com/blogs/chaos-and-pain%C2%AE/anybody-can-get-lean-bulk-first-then-worry-about-your-abs-the-story-of-bruce-randall)

* What you need to know about Bruce Randall is that he gained up to 400lbs with a leg that was broken in 7 places from a motor cycle accident, relying on the good morning for his lower body development (so I don’t want to hear anymore about your bad knees), became one of the strongest humans to ever walk the planet, then cut away all the fluff to become a champion level bodybuilder.

* Breakfast usually consisted of two quarts of milk, 1 1/2 loaves of bread and 28 fried eggs, when his bodyweight was about 340lb.  At times his milk consumption reached 19 quarts per day.

* Bruce’s programming was absolutely bonkers and proof that effort is ultimately the driver of success when gaining.

* He existed in an era with limited supplements and, if steroids WERE available, they were in their infancy.  The old school method still work.

* If Bruce can get to 400lbs and still be a bodybuilder, you are NOT going to ruin your body by getting to 20% bodyfat in the pursuit of growth.

**J M BLAKLEY**

* [The story](https://www.t-nation.com/training/37-tips-and-tales-from-dave-tate)

* >“For breakfast you need to eat four of those breakfast sandwiches from McDonalds. I don’t care which ones you get, but make sure to get four. Order four hash browns, too. Now grab two packs of mayonnaise and put them on the hash browns and then slip them into the sandwiches. Squish that shit down and eat. That’s your breakfast.”

* >“For lunch you’re gonna eat Chinese food. Now I don’t want you eating that crappy stuff. You wanna get the stuff with MSG. None of that non-MSG bullshit. I don’t care what you eat but you have to sit down and eat for at least 45 minutes straight. You can’t let go of the fork.” 

* >“For dinner you’re gonna order an extra-large pizza with everything on it. Literally everything. If you don’t like sardines, don’t put 'em on, but anything else that you like you have to load it on there. After you pay the delivery guy, I want you to take the pie to your coffee table, open that fucker up, and grab a bottle of oil. It can be olive oil, canola oil, whatever. Anything but motor oil. And I want you to pour that shit over the pie until half of the bottle is gone.” 

* >“Now you’re on the clock,” he continues. ""After 20 minutes your brain is going to tell you you’re full. Don’t listen to that shit. You have to try and eat as much of the pizza as you can before that 20-minute mark. Double up pieces if you have to. I’m telling you now, you’re going to get three or four pieces in and you’re gonna want to quit. You f**king can’t quit. You have to sit on that couch until every piece is done.

* J M Blakely was one of the greatest benchers to ever live.  A back injury limited him from being able to compete in full powerlifting meets, but he owned many records in MANY weight classes based on his ability to manipulate his bodyweight through EXTREME nutrition.

* There are LOTS of videos out there further detailing this diet

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaU6TnUoe24 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqtI7XdtY4

* The key to remember is that this was NOT a 6 month approach.  It was a 3-4 week plateau breaking approach.  But again, extreme results require extreme measures.

**CONCLUSION**

* Gainers, I hope this was fun to read, because it was a blast to write.  I’m 36 years old, I’ve been training since I was 14, and I envy those of you that are just getting started and have SO much great information available to you.  I get legit, genuine joy by sharing as much as I can with you to help you there so please, if you have any questions or comments, leave them here and let’s chat!",2022-07-12 16:43:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/vxfney/the_holy_text_and_patron_saints_of_rgainit_3/
vuvc50,gainit,how long until my stomach adjusts to a larger diet?,"I (25 m, 150 ish 6'0"") realized last week that i had been basically living on coffee for a week and it's really wearing on me. My weight never fluctuates more than 5lbs up or down. I climb trees for a living so always active, plus this summer heat is nuts right now. 

Anyways, moral of the story. I am getting strict on myself about a minimum of 3 meals daily plus a shake before bed. I'm not measuring macros like crazy yet or meal prepping but would guess in the ballpark of 2500-3000 cal per day, which is way better than the 1000-1500 cal range that i was in. 

Tonight though, i missed the usual window for dinner by an hour so hastily made 2 thick PB&Js and had that shake of about 750 cal maybe 30 minutes later. It felt like i was gonna throw up though so it took about an hour to get down and now I've been trying to sleep for 3 hours but my stomach is still uncomfortable full. I already pooped so it's not an intestinal issue. 

Probably just stretched my stomach too much in one sitting. But damn, this sucks. 

My work schedule means i make a small breakfast at home then grab something from the gas station like a hotdog or toquitos an hour later. Lunch is maybe 4-5 hours later. Dinner is another 5-6 hours. Then maybe another 2-3 for the shake. 

Do y'all have any feedback on either the stretched stomach discomfort or advice for the rest of this. I'm hoping to get up to 180 (+30lbs) by the end of the year. I don't care about clean or dirty bulking because my job won't let me keep fat for long.",2022-07-09 06:19:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/vuvc50/how_long_until_my_stomach_adjusts_to_a_larger_diet/
vtvfer,gainit,A little advice on diet,"Before bulking, work out what foods you can't tolerate.

Pissing out of your ass several times a day, getting stomach cramps, and waking up in the middle of the night with acid reflux is NOT normal or necessary, even on a bulk.

Bulk on the right foods - healthy foods but more importantly foods that don't cause you grief - and you might go to the toilet twice a day, instead of once like before. You may get the occasional and inexplicable stomach niggle. And you may sometimes get indigestion of some sort because you ate a big meal and deadlifted straight after.

But as a rule you shouldn't experience these things regularly or to any extreme. It's OK to feel full, but it's not OK to feel genuine malaise because the foods you are eating don't agree with you.

Some people are lactose intolerant, or wheat intolerant. In some people, coffee causes all kinds of trouble. Even some vegetables will cause problems, and beans. Unfortunately, some people get used to the thought that their guts are just messed up, and that's just the way it is, and in the case of something like coffee, they can become addicted. It becomes an every day thing to be in discomfort, but that needs to be addressed if you are interested in performance (and longevity).

So pay attention to the signals, consult a doctor (or ideally a dietician/nutritionist) and experiment with some exclusion diets. Fix it and you'll be able to eat more, because you'll be digesting easier, and your body will be better nourished, because the foods you put in will have a good environment in which to be processed, rather than a battleground.

It is well worth the investment to get your gut in order.",2022-07-07 22:55:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/vtvfer/a_little_advice_on_diet/

Morning: grilled cheese (2 loaves of bread and 2 slices of cheese) and buy a snack from a coffee shop (1 and a half hot dog covered in a layer of bread)

Noon: 4/5 tablespoon of rice and approximately 200g of meat (chicken, pork, beef or fish depending on the day but usually chicken) with one or two side dishes depending on the day as well (beans, potatoes, lettuce, etc.) 
2 bananas and a glass of whole milk

Evening: snack on whatever i can find, usually bread, milk and cheese

v5sd0z,gainit,Ever since I've started gaining/put on weight I've been sleeping way more and I'm tired all the time,"When I was 65kg @ 6,1 I could function on 6 hours sleep and feel alright, I'd usually nap during the day.

Now that I'm 72kg Im sleeping 10-12 hours and honestly feel so much more tired than when I was borderline malnourished and drunk alcohol regularly. I eat a healthy balance of food and take multivitamins, my fitbit indicates my sleep quality is fine. Also had blood tests when I was eating nothing most days and wasn't low on iron or anything

The only thing that has really changed in this period of time from feeling ok with no sleep to tired all the time (was about 4 months) is regular overeating.

I've had a coffee today and an energy drink but I'm pretty sure I could have a nap right now even though I had 10 hours sleep.

Partially I'm wondering if it's because I've been underweight most of my life and my weight hasn't increased since like 14 that now I'm actually eating adequately my body is growing again (I'm 21)",2022-06-06 02:12:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/v5sd0z/ever_since_ive_started_gainingput_on_weight_ive/

During lockdown in 2020 I hit rock bottom. I was in the worst shape of my life and depressed out of my mind. I was barely eating, sleeping or excercising. I think for a long time there I was just existing. 

When lockdown ended I realized I needed to get my shit together. I was 6' 3 and 155 pounds. I looked like a stick. I got my ass back in the gym and onto a proper bulking diet. Slowly but surely I made the gains and the rest is history  


##Pics

##Programs

5x a week hypertrophy based program with alternating rep ranges each week. I took a few principles from different programs and customized them to my needs/goals. It was primarily based on PHAT  

##Diet

**Total**
4000 calories 

**Breakfast:**
4 eggs
4 hash browns 
4 peanut butter toasts with coffee 

**Lunch:**
Chicken breast, broccoli and rice 

**2nd Lunch:**
Same as above 

**Pre workout meal:**
Banana shake with berries and oats 

**Post workout meal:**
100g cashews 
Bowl of cereal/oats

**Dinner:**
Mince Beef pasta  


Overall it was a pretty standard bulking diet. However, eating this much everyday has made me hate food.....until I look at my training partner who is cutting and seeing him look absolutely miserable with his 1200 calorie limit makes me feel a bit better about the whole thing. 


The one thing that I really love about working out is that it's one of the few things in life where results are pretty much guaranteed and tangible if you do it right (you can literally see your progress in the mirror). 

That isn't true for a lot of other activities. For example you could be a great student and prep really hard for an exam but you might still mess it up on the day if you aren't feeling well or if the paper has content that wasn't covered in class. 

Or conversely you could be a terrible investor but you buy during a bull market and make mad gains not because of your ingenious stock picks but because the market as a whole was being pumped up.  

But with working out there's very little luck involved - just effort, consistency and shit tons of oats",2022-05-07 11:29:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ukbcax/m236_3_155_200_lbs_15_years/

ryvvgl,gainit,Halp: Under-eater hitting a satiation wall,"I have undereating tendencies. Some mild health conditions recently tipped the balance and now I also have unintentional weight loss. Given all the screenings I've gone through in the past year I'm about 95% sure it's not cancer, just loss of appetite and increased fidgeting/restlessness.

Things that I am doing: 

  Daily light cardio helps, but it's mostly making me crave low-calorie fruits, and beans. I try to load up the latter with cooking fats and this is my main food I eat large amounts of right now. Olives are great. Loaded oatmeal is great. I've been adding sesame seeds to everything for the iron and extra calories. With vegetables I aim for sweet starchy ones like peas, corn, winter squash. I enjoy bread, pasta, buttery pastries, but I realized I'm not actually consuming as much as I thought I was. I love cheese and yogurt but have an ethical aversion to cheap dairy so this is not cost-efficient. (Also why is buying full fat like playing Where's Waldo with the dairy aisle?!)

 I cut back on caffeine to one tea/coffee a week. I was an occasional edibles user but I completely stopped because I heard weed kills sober appetite. No alcohol either because that also kills my appetite. 

\-

Things that are not working:

  I hit a satiation wall alarmingly quick with nuts/nut butters, eggs, meat, coconut milk, fried or creamy foods. Like a quarter portion of rich curry or *most* of a peanut butter sandwich and I really, really, don't want to eat for the rest of the day. Why am I like this. My tolerance for sweets has dipped over the years too. I put a gob of honey/sugar in most my savory meals. A couple cookies or half a snickers 2, 3 times a week. 

 I'm not a grazer/snacker and I struggle to make this into a routine that sticks. I was a big social eater but now I am immuno-compromised during a pandemic and don't even have coworkers whose habits I can mirror.

\-

Things that are confusing:

Avocados, hummus, sweet potatoes, dried fruit. Should I eat more/less?! Guacamole and hummus helps me put down more starchy carbs than mayo or peanut butter, and I like dried fruit rehydrated by cooking with oatmeal and pilaf. But people who try to lose weight/stay thin seem to swear by these foods so now I don't know. 

Just regularly mainlining a bunch of chips seems like a tempting but terrible option. Overweight but *healthy* eaters say they eat big quantities and a lot of rich foods, but volume and richness are uphill battles for me. Grain-based carbs like bread, rice, pasta make me full, but most people seem to have the opposite problem.

I feel like I eat a good amount, but my clothes tell me I'm deluded, stop being a big baby, and just put more food in mouth.

\-

Medium carbs, medium protein, stuffed with high fat seems to be my zone. Any good ideas? I'm always on the lookout for habit hacks too. 

&#x200B;

**TriggerWarning:** >!I can't mentally deal with tracking calories as a metric or regularly forcing myself to eat unpalatable food -- I grew up with severe ""clean your plate"" type food abuse (being forced to eat puke or stuff I was allergic to), and then later on I also had to distance myself from multiple individuals with EDs/body image concerns who lash out, control, and invalidate other people.!<",2022-01-08 09:15:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ryvvgl/halp_undereater_hitting_a_satiation_wall/

r6j9vd,gainit,Handy foods to have at the house (when life gets busy),"Hello Gainers,

I wrote this ""list"" up to help with some of my nutrition and to mainly get it out of my brain. I realise this is sort of a food list and there are plenty of food lists out there (like Jon Andersons Deep Water) for helping you get in good food when you are looking to build muscle.

I wasn't going to post it, but then I though someone out there may find something useful in here and might help those who are not so organised with their nutrition. 

Anyways this is tailored towards busy periods of my life (like right now), where I don't have enough time (or certainly not prioritizing it well enough) to do food prep. I have put this list together of good calorific and high protein foods that are usually available in the house, and that will allow me some flexibility of being able to whip up a meal or snack without much thought, prep and with what else I can find in the fridge/cupboard (I am blessed to WFH btw).

  
**Eggs**  
Staple of my diet, there are plenty of things you can do with them and they are a solid protein. My usual goto is 4 fried eggs with some vegetables and bacon. But I will also go through phases of scrambled eggs with cottage cheese, omelette etc.  I eat a lot of eggs so they are usually at the top of most shopping lists we have.

  
**Bacon**  
Because what goes well with eggs.....

  
**Peanut Butter**  
Must have item in the house. Buy the big 1KG tubs if you can as they are usually cheaper, last a little longer and also allow you to get teaspoons into the tub a lot easier than the smaller glass jars. I tend to have a variety of foods that go well with Peanut Butter these being:

* with apple slices (scoop PB with the slices off a plate)
* with a banana (slather it on top)
* of a teaspoon (just PB)
* in a sandwich with some jam/jelly/honey or anything else sweet
* in a tortilla wrap with see above (I find these little lighter on the stomach for me)
* on an egg omelette - sounds gross tastes great

**Protein Shake**  
Another staple at the house for an easy protein boost. I usually cycle between just water, water and milk topped up, water and plant-based milk topped up or full milk/plant-based milk. Depends what my goals are, how I am feeling and how much milk is at the house (we have children that take priority). It also mixes in nicely to Greek yoghurt if your not feeling a shake and fancy something more substantial. Plus overall Greek yoghurt tends to have  higher protein when compared to milk so thats always good.

**Milk/Dairy**  
The white stuff or the plant based stuff. Personally cows milk is my goto just because of the protein and it is always in the house, but the plant based stuff is a nice change - my usual go to is Hazelnut milk and Almond milk. Cottage cheese is a great little food to either eat on its own or mix in with your foods. Also Greek yoghurt is another staple thats usually in the fridge, as mentioned above and below this goes well with a lot of things.

  
**Fruit**  
Honestly whatever is in the bowl or the fridge I will use as a snack. The usual suspects are granny smith apples (the green sour ones), tangerines (or some variety of the orange family), banana, kiwi, grapes and berries (frozen or fresh).

  
**Vegetables**  
Avocado just eat it with the eggs and the bacon. Broccoli and cauliflower steam it and drop some butter on it, or oven roast/air fry it it. Peppers and onions are easy vegetables to fry up with your eggs. Also a key ingredient to the Brian Alsruhe Bulking Breakfast [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h6GdS0PHHk).

  
**Misc**  
Fruit and nut bars from Lidls, cottage cheese, nuts, hot sauces, oatmeal, meats and other items that would be apart of the evening meal.

  
Overall I try and drink between 4-6 litres of water depending how thirsty I am (and how often I am peeing). 3/4 cups of coffee and maybe a herbal near the end of the day.

Food wise a day could look like:

  
**Morning**  
*Fast* 

**Lunch**  
Pre-workout Protein Shake w/Water  
\*Workout\*  
Break the fast with a big meal that usually involves eggs, vegetables and whatever meat we have going (sausages, bacon, frikkadellen, cold meats etc)  
Apple and PB  
Protein Shake w/Water & Milk topped up to wash lunch down

**Second Lunch**  
This could be leftover food from the night before, sandwich or a big bowl of oatmeal.

**Afternoon Snack 1**  
Fruit, maybe a banana with PB or Fruit and nut bar

**Afternoon Snack 2**  
Greek yoghurt with PB or protein shake and some berries, nuts and seeds.

**Dinner**  
Whatever the family is having, usually meat and vegetables. I try and get plenty of vegetables here if its going.

**Evening Snack**  
Protein Shake w/Water & Milk topped up  
Anything else I fancy - Eggs or PB&J sandwich or Greek yoghurt or  scoops of cottage cheese straight from the tub.",2021-12-01 16:53:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/r6j9vd/handy_foods_to_have_at_the_house_when_life_gets/
q26rmv,gainit,Got GERD from Bulking... I need some advice,"I'm pretty sure I got GERD from a 3000 calories dirty Bulking which lasted a few months and even if this summer I was on cut and now I'm on a clean bulk with way less calories things only got worse...and burping isn't the main problem, feeling like throwing up even if I ate 2 hours before the workout is... 
It started a few months ago and became worse and worse. Burping extremely often and extremely loud, sometimes stomach burns, the feeling of fullness 80% of the day, nausea and difficulties swallowing in the morning and during workouts, also a sticky secretion appearing in my mouth for no reason mostly in the morning... From what I red pretty sure I have GERD. I'm currently on a 2600kcal Bulking diet with 160g of protein and I want some advice on how can I mantain it with avoiding foods that can make gerd worse.
 I recently stopped drinking soda and smoothies (which helped bcs 1 smoothie had 1000 calories) because I realized how bad they make me burp and trigger my stomach. I heard that I shouldn't drink coffee either and I don't know what should I drink in order to replace it and get the energy pump.

#Background

PICs:    
2018: [138](https://imgur.com/QmQMq5T)  Not a great photo, but the rest of my body looked the same.

2021: [195(as of writing this)](https://imgur.com/rLh322W) 

I’m just going to copy/paste this from my last meet report and add in the updated info:    

The last couple of years have been rough as fuck, and my training in 2020 really reflected that.   

Here’s a quick summary of my training/personal life since I started in 2018.    

- Jan 26, 2018 - First started trying to gain weight, I was 138lbs at 6 feet. Also started going to the gym, though with no plan, guidance or consistency.    


- August 2018 - Wife has an ectopic pregnancy, needs emergency surgery.    


- September 2019 - I begin strength training consistently. I think I ran a bro split for a few months? Then hopped on 531 for Beginners.    


- January 2019 -  1st miscarriage    


- September 2019 - First meet. S/B/D were 308, 165, 385. I ran out of steam around this time and took  a break until February 2020.    


- 2020: COVID. Made my home gym around May. Started training with /u/goose_dies in June.    


- July 2020: 2nd miscarriage.    


- October 2020: Ran out of mental steam and give a fuck. Took a break from training. Got into therapy. Prescribed antidepressants and ADHD medication shortly after.    

- December 2020 - Started training again. On and off consistency at first.    

- January 2021 - Trained consistently for 1 month. Contacted /u/goose_dies and began training with him again.    

- April 2021 - My wife and I separated. I began TRT due to low testosterone.    

- May 15, 2021 - 2nd meet - S/B/D - 365/185/455.    

- June 2021 - I’m currently taking a break from coached training, running 531 BBB Beefcake at the moment.     

Also to note, I work full time as IT support with an on-call rotation and am a part time student as well.    

I know my physique isn’t impressive, but that's not the point. The point is I’ve gained and kept 60 fucking pounds in 3 years, and done it through the shit show that is my life recently.    

&nbsp;

#My Day

&nbsp;

So, lets get into what my day mostly looks like, assuming everything goes well:    

###### Wake-Up - 5:30 AM:

This is the biggest variable. I haven;t had a solid or great night of sleep  in years and occasionally will go 24 hours without it.     

###### 6:30 AM: 

I have no appetite in the morning and by now my meds have mostly worn off, so my brain is mush. I keep it simple: 600ml Whole Milk, 2 Scoops Protein Powder,, 5g Creatine. 
On the weekend or if I have the day off, I might make an actual meal, but that happens at more like 10 am.      

###### 11 AM: Lunch:    

2 PB&J on protein bread - I get this(and most my food) from Aldis, I’ll throw links at the bottom.     

1 Greek Protein Yogurt or a prepackaged single serving Chicken Salad w/ cranberries and almonds, or both.     

Some sort of meat snack. Currently hard salami, but a lot of the time it’s beef sticks.    


######  6 pm:

 Training. Both weight and cardio. I use Granite Supplement Pre-Workout and Intra-Carb    

###### 7pm: Dinner:     

Meat - I buy these as frozen patties and cook 2 or 3 up a night depending on my appetite. If I want something leaner, I have frozen Chicken Patties I like as well that I’ll sub in.    

Jasmine Rice cooked in chicken bone broth    

.5 half a package of microwavable steamer veggies, normally broccoli or sweet potato    

######  Snacks: 

These are spread throughout the day, typically 1 mid-morning, 1 mid-afternoon, and another after work.    

- Sims Protein Snack Packs - these things are fucking great. Some jerky, roasted sunflower seeds, and nuts, depending on what package you get. 

- Park Street Snack Packs - Also great. Some cheese, and nuts with dried fruit   

- 4oz Cranberry Juice    
    
- Blueberries - I eat these fuckers by the pint    

- Mixed Green Salad with some light Caesar dressing

- Coffee and Energy Drinks     


&nbsp;
#Supplements/Medications
&nbsp;

Here’s my current supplement stack and what medications I’m on and why:    

- Sertraline x 75mg daily - Antidepressant/Anxiety meds    

- D-Amphetamine x 10mg daily - ADHD Meds    

- Chantix 1mg x Twice Daily - Stop smoking meds    

- Cialis x 5mg daily -  extended release to handle some side effects of my other meds    

- Fish Oil x 2 pills daily    

- D3 x 1 pill daily    

- Zinc x 2 pills daily    

- Magnesium x 1 pill daily    

- Granite Supplement Joint Care x 2 pills daily    

- Granite Supplement Collagen Peptides x 1 scoop daily    

- HCG x 2 lozenge weekly - Part of my TRT treatment    

- Testosterone x 1 .8 shot weekly    

The medications have definitely helped. Most of the supplements were recommended by my Dr., but the stuff from Granite I got for free as a gift. I really like the joint care pills, I used to have niggling knee pain that I don’t feel anymore. Just started the Peptides, so the jury is still out on them.    


&nbsp;
#Tricks and Tips    
&nbsp;

So, most the advice given here, at least from the handful of people who aren’t dumb and eating bird seed, is solid. Especially anything /u/MythicalStrength says. Listen to him, seriously.     

But they are coming from a place where their minds aren’t actively fighting them. Speaking personally, depression and ADHD are the biggest factors. There have been several days where I literally never leave the couch except to use the bathroom or get food. Before I started eating like this, the food bit may not have happened. Our brains being like that makes a huge difference. So, to do this, we need to trick our brains, or cheat or take shortcuts.     


Buy prepackaged/half prepped food. For me, having to cook or prepare all my meals is one of the biggest issues I’ve run into. Even crock pot cooking doesn’t happen consistently. Using pre-pattied beef and chicken, microwavable veg, and pre-portioned sides has helped considerably. Nowadays, the only thing I have to actually prep is my rice, which is done in my insta-pot. 


Avoid fast food. I know the convenience is tempting, but even if it technically hits your macros, it’s not worth it. Between cost and lack of other nutrients, it’s not worth it in the long run. 


I track my calories and protein, though I routinely go over what MFP says. I only track because it helps my ADHD stay on task with my diet.


If shopping is difficult for you to do, due to covid many places deliver groceries now. Even in bumble-fuck northern Wisconsin my aldis delivers. Deliver charge is either 3.99, or 7.99 depending on time of delivery, but I’ll pay that not to go shopping myself


Journaling has helped me keep my mind focused, especially with my depression/anxiety. Write out what your trying to achieve and reminders to yourself, especially when you fuck up your plan. Because that will happen.


When you fuck up, remember this: a day, week, month, none of that matters. Drag yourself kicking and screaming back through however helps you best. It’s a marathon, not a sprint is a common refrain here for a reason.  I know it’s hard. The thoughts keep coming in, and drive you down. They creep in when you're standing there cooking, or sitting on the couch trying to force yourself to get up. When you're going to the bathroom. As you're trying to sleep. Constantly digging into you. And I don’t have a real solution for that. If I did, I’d be one rich fuck. But there is no shame from taking a break to get yourself right then coming back. I’ve done 3 month(s) long breaks, and am still getting stronger. Your gains won’t just disappear forever. 


&nbsp;
#Wrap-Up    
&nbsp;

Listen. The point I’m trying to make is that there is a way. We can work around our problems and still accomplish our goals. It’s not our fault we have a mental illness(es), but it is our responsibility. Whining and complaining aren’t a solution, and while the advice we get isn’t bad, it might not be what we need, or won’t work for us. I’m not sure of this, but I highly doubt a normal person has had an anxiety attack over cooking. I have, recently too. Shit like this isn’t rational, but we can do it. For myself, my current goal is to reestablish my routine(again), and begin planning for my meet in January. And to keep gaining. One day I’ll lean out. Eventually.

nclq6j,gainit,Gain back some weight after an eating disorder?,"I'm 29 f, 182cm, used to live with 64kg. Regular me always lived with that stable weight,  and also was one of those people who ate a lot and still remained slim to which many did envy me. I really used to love food and eating, all my meals and extra snacks. Never paid attention to my weight,  or tried to lose or gain any. 

Then.. depression hit me, and I stopped eating,  I mean I drink a milk coffee with a biscuit,  and few were the days where I ate something else during the day or had something worthy to be qualified as a meal. 

6 weeks later I had an awakening! And found out my new weight was 57kg! And I looked at myself on the mirror and was like: where is my butt??!! I'm still too sad to eat though,  but forced myself a bit and paid more attention.. then a month later, which is.. today, I found out I lost another Kg T_T

To be honest, I really like how thin my waist is now, and the gap between my thighs. But I'm fully aware that I should eat!! Yet I don't even fancy eating and my appetite is gone. I don't know where to start or if even I should start, and I can't afford a nutritionist.

l7wam8,gainit,Example Bulking Diets/Advice From Past Eras,"Greetings Once Again Gainers,

After another 5 day stretch of weird shifts at work with lots of downtime, I've been pouring through the archives over at Physical Culture Study (fantastic website) and read through every single article on weight gaining.  I wanted to pass on some of that knowledge to you in an easy to parse through topic here on the r/gainit.  I cannot personally vouch for any of these approaches, as I've not had the time to employ them, but they come from some of the best in the business and, if nothing else, can serve as a contrast from the now standard ""eat X amount of carbs, Y amount of protein and Z about of fats"" that many of you are failing to find success with.  

Without further ado...

Please enjoy, and as always, discussion is awesome.",2021-01-29 16:06:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/l7wam8/example_bulking_dietsadvice_from_past_eras/
l3ssxv,gainit,Gaining weight without hitting calorie goal daily?,"A couple of months ago I was 185 and I’m shocked to see that I’m currently 199 exactly (6’2). 

Because of life, there have been many days where I don’t even come close to my daily goal, but despite that I’m gaining at a good pace and I don’t really understand how or why.

On an ideal day I eat 3 meals and drink my shake that rounds out to about 990 calories with rarely any snacking throughout the day.

Mornings are usually 3-4 eggs, toast, with some variation of a side , then I make my shake which I drink throughout the next few hours. Lunch has typically been a double wrap burrito from chipotle at LEAST 3 times a week. It’s expensive but hopefully it’s paying off. Dinner is whatever my mom makes, which I appreciate since I’m busy with school. It’s honestly hard to keep track of my calories for things like homemade food not prepared by me, but I typically stuff myself with whatever food is there and hope for the best which you will probably flame me for, but it seems to be working so far. I also drink half a gallon of water throughout the day and that’s it.

As I’ve mentioned there are just days where I simply don’t get it done. It’s usually the weekends, where I have a time commitment from the very early morning to almost mid afternoon. I eat breakfast (Bacon Egg and Cheese + Coffee from Dunkin’) those days, and will probably eat a late lunch (Moes or Chipotle) after I’m done with my obligations. But by the time I get home on weekends (after legs on Saturday especially) I find myself having been too tired to go and make my shake/figure out dinner. I just shower and crash until the next day. Let’s assume I get 1600 calories on those weekend days from my two meals.

Sorry for rambling, but my main question revolves around whether or not the “calorie goal” is as strict as people make it seem. Is there supposed to be room for error? I figured when people stress the daily aspect, it’s for a reason.

On average I may have 4 great days of eating a week, one solid, and two where I know I didn’t eat enough. Despite that though, I’ve had gained steadily. 

Primary goal is muscle gain and I’m trying to bulk up on a PPL Split for 6 days a week thanks to recommendations from some of you guys. Started a few weeks ago. Thanks in advance.",2021-01-24 04:53:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/l3ssxv/gaining_weight_without_hitting_calorie_goal_daily/
l1dy0b,gainit,"OFFICE DRONE GAINING: What to buy, how to train, what snacks to bring","Greetings Once Again Gainers,

Like many of you gainers, I work an office job in front of a computer at a desk that has minimal physical demand and lots of sitting.  This allows for unique opportunities for gaining, IF one is willing to take a few unique actions in order to maximize the potential contained within.  I wanted to share some tips I’ve picked up along the way so that you can make the most of your situation.  This should work for those of you that are stuck in an office OR for those of you that are full time students, but even those of you with less sedentary lifestyles may be able to pick something up from it.

---

**THINGS TO BUY** 

* INSULATED LUNCHBOX.  Having a way to bring food to the office is key to ensuring you have food to eat.  You don’t want to eat out for every meal, as it’s costly and you have minimal control over food quality.  You also run the risk of losing your parking space if you leave for lunch.  AND, if you bring food, you don’t run the risk of working through lunch, which is typical for you workaholics.  My wife bought me [this one]( https://www.amazon.com/Performa-Punisher-MealPrep-Bag-Accommodate/dp/B077GRQFQN/ref=sr_1_35?dchild=1&keywords=punisher+insulated+lunch+box&qid=1611162229&sr=8-35) for my birthday, and it’s really awesome, but you can get something simple.  The other benefit of having your own lunchbox is you can keep your food in it and next to you vs using the office communal fridge, which prevents food thieves from eating your lunch and leaving you hungry.  And, of course, I keep writing “lunch”, but in truth, I pack a LOT of food for work.  I literally eat something every hour that I’m at work, and that lunchbox goes a long way to ensure that I have enough food to get me through my shift.

* STAINLESS STEEL WATER BOTTLE.  I like a [half gallon size]( https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Bottle-AOZEX-Insulated-Leakproof/dp/B085S6M2TR/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3QOFYWV32ZGIW&dchild=1&keywords=stainless+steel+half+gallon+water+bottle&qid=1611162464&sprefix=stainless+steel+half+gall%2Caps%2C179&sr=8-8) like that one.  If you’re gaining, you’re eating a lot of protein.  Protein, as a macronutrient, requires more water for digestion than any other macronutrient.  It’s why most “survival food” has minimal protein in it and much more fats and carbs.  But you don’t run the risk of dying of dehydration in an office IF you’re keeping hydrated.  The other perk about drinking a lot of water while working is that it will force you to get up more frequently so that you can go use the bathroom, which can prevent the maladies associated with remaining in a seated position for so long.  I aim to fill and drink this 3 times in a shift, getting in 6 liters of water a day.  Oh yeah, and steel tends to have less toxins associated with it compared to drinking from plastic bottles, and this is environmentally friendly compared to junking a bunch of single use plastic bottles, so that’s cool too.

* GLASS FOOD CONTAINERS. [This]( https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Storage-Containers-Piece-Proof/dp/B082SN4QH6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=X03R665LMPQ6&dchild=1&keywords=glass+storage+containers&qid=1611162677&sprefix=glass%2Caps%2C196&sr=8-4) is the set I have, but there are a ton out there.  That lunchbox I linked came with containers, and I still use them for veggies and sandwiches, but when it comes to food that needs reheating or has sauces/staining elements to it, glass is the way to go. Zapping plastic in the microwave never sits well with me, and if you put something with pasta sauce in a plastic container the stain never gets out.  I also find that food tends to stay fresher in glass containers, which is great if you make things in bulk and eat them throughout the week.  I’ve had leftover last MUCH longer once I switched from tupperwear to glass containers. 

* GRIPPERS.  [Captains of Crush are King]( https://www.amazon.com/IronMind-Captains-Crush-Hand-Gripper/dp/B0094WEFJM/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=captains+of+crush+grippers&qid=1611165376&sr=8-4), but I have heard good things about heavy grippers as well.  These are great toys to have at the office whenever you have some downtime and wanna get in some sort of training.  People tend to neglect their grip a lot in their training, and these dudes will right fix that.  Make no mistake: these aren’t sporting goods store grippers that you’re going to mindlessly click for a million reps: this is a real workout.  

* PLASTIC OR BAMBOO SILVERARE.  If you’re fortunate enough to have your own desk, make sure it has a lot of ready to go silverware in it.  Nothing is worse than packing a whole bunch of food for work and then finding out you have no way of eating it because you forgot to pack THAT.  Consequently, I picked up some [bamboo silverware]( https://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Utensils-Cutlery-Set-BEWBOW/dp/B07MGVXFWJ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=bamboo+silverware&qid=1611162990&sr=8-9) that is attached to my lunchbox now so that I know I’ll never be without.  Also great when there are surprise office birthdays, because people always remember the cake and always forget the forks.

* SLOW COOKER/INSTANT POT.  I’ve written about all this already in my post on [bachelor bulking]( https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/), but seriously, get some sort of way to make a lot of food with little effort, put it in the BIG glass container, then transition it to the little glass containers and put that in your lunchbox for the day.

**THINGS TO DO** 

* WORKOUT BEFORE WORK.  One of the best things you, as a gainer, can do is to workout BEFORE you get to work.  Why?  Because training makes you hungry, and if you’re struggling to gain, increasing appetite before you get to work is a GOOD thing.  Sure, it also helps make you awake and is good for health and all that, but we’re talking about gaining here.  You can either do a full on lifting workout, a 10-20 minute conditioning workout, OR you could even do a simple short Tabata style workout.

If you’re unfamiliar with what Tabata is: [here]( https://www.t-nation.com/training/tabata-method) is a great article on it by Dan John.  Yeah, it talks about fat loss, but since we’re using it to TRIGGER appetite and THEN eat, it works well for our purposes.  Burpees are a great movement to use this on, as they require no equipment and you can knock it out stupidly quick.  If you have MORE than 4 minutes, look for some Crossfit WODs or just do a simple circuit workout.  You could do something like 5 burpees-10 push ups-20 squats for as many rounds as possible in 10-20 minutes.  Either way, get in the training BEFORE work and then spend the entire time you’re there eating out of that lunch box.  And speaking of eating…

**OFFICE DRONE SNACKS**

These are the foods you should have at your desk, ready to go at a moment’s notice to get your gain on.

* PROTEIN BARS.  I’m a big fan of [Quest](https://www.questnutrition.com/collections/protein-bars), but there are tons of great brands out there.  Costco sells a knock off of Quest that is quite good and cheap, and I buy a lot of those as well.  These are perfect to keep at the desk or in a backpack/pocket for when you need to get on a protein fix.

* NUTS.  I’m not going to link you to nuts: you can figure that out.  But nuts have just TONS of positive qualities associated with them due to their healtful fats, and they are very calorie dense.  Have a jar at your desk.

* DRIED FRUIT.  Raisins, prunes, dates, figs, whatever.  These things don’t spoil and are packed with calories, along with nutrients.  Another fantastic snack.

* NUT BUTTERS.  Peanut butter, almond, cashew, etc.  This, combined with your plastic or bamboo spoon, is absolute money for a quick and easy snack.  I’m actually really into the brand [Nuts N More]( https://nuts-n-more.com/collections/online-store), which is a peanut/almond butter mixed with a protein powder for a slightly better macro breakdown, but as long as you stick with the natural stuff that requires stirring you should be just fine.

* INSTANT OATMEAL.  I like [this brand]( https://www.betteroats.com/), because it coming with it’s own measuring pouch is pretty cool, but again, there are a lot of choices out there.  Instant oatmeal is a real treat on a cold day, and you can use your office microwave or coffee maker to get some hot water to make this quick.

jnv60o,gainit,Diet advice for powerbuilding (M/24yo),"Hi Guys, 

3 weeks ago I started on a power building program that consists of 5 training days a week with the days alternately focusing on building/powerlifting/building/powerlifting etc. So one day I do a bunch of accessory exercises (e.g. dumbbell rows, bent over rows, triceps rope pushdowns, pulldowns, skull crushers, etc.) and the day after that I do compound exercises (e.g. squat/bench/deadlift/shoulder press), then the next day I start again with the accessory excercises.  
The program is from **Kizen** and it's actually 6 days a week but I brought it down to 5 due to time constraints. Right now my 1RM PR on compound exercises are as follows:

\- **Deadlift** 155kg / 342 lbs.  
\- **Bench** 86kg / 190 lbs  
\- **Squat** 130kg / 287 lbs  
\- **Strict Shoulder Press** 55kg / 121 lbs

My primary goals is to get more muscle mass and more definition in overall physique in combination with more strength to up those numbers. However, I've been following a diet on which I'm not completely sure. I'm a 24 year old guy who is 185cm tall (6'1) and weigh in on 87kg (192 lbs). I'd consider myself as a normal to slightly muscular guy with normal body fat (12,7% currently).

Here's how my diet looks like:

**Breakfast:**  
4 slices of wholegrain bread, all of them with peanut butter and strawberry Jelly.  
1 Whey protein shake  
1 Glass of milk  
1 Mug of coffee

**Lunch**:  
4 slices of wholegrain bread, with a total of 12 chicken filet slices (so that's 3 slices per slice of bread) and cottage cheese on every slice.  
1 glass of milk  
1 Mug of coffee

**Diner**:  
1 to 1,5 plate of whatever is served in my household. It's always pretty basic: Pasta bolognese, white rice with tika masala sauce and chicken, potatoes with vegetables and a piece of meat (sausage, schnitzel, etc.)

**After training**:  
1 Whey portein shake + 5gr creatine monohydrate

If I feel hungry in between I usually take some low-fat quark with some syrup to give it some taste. But this doesn't happen very often. I cheat in weekends with snacks and soda (zero variant however) and don't really pay attention to clean eating, only on calorie intake.

I'm very curious if there's someone that is willing to give my any advice on how diet. Any remarks, notices, or whatever you'd like to say is welcome!!",2020-11-04 11:32:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/jnv60o/diet_advice_for_powerbuilding_m24yo/

jj49uu,gainit,Water consumption on non-lifting days,"Hello all, just a quick question.

I drink about a gallon of water, plus other liquids on days I lift, with getting at least half a gallon before I work out.

This is mainly, so I don't get faint before lifting, but I know the value of drinking water.

However, I noticed a trend that on non-lifting days, I tend to drink.....zero water. I drink a lot of liquids like coffee, soda, etc. And while I know these still hydrate you, not as much as water.

What is the negative effects toward MUSCLE GROWTH by not getting enough water?

I couldn't find anything that really answered that question, so I'm hoping that someone has something.

Thanks all!",2020-10-27 16:21:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/jj49uu/water_consumption_on_nonlifting_days/
j6rm5v,gainit,The Big Boys Meal Plan by JM Blakley,"[Thought this would be useful for people here. Enjoy!](https://www.strength-oldschool.com/blogs/news/the-big-boys-menu-plan-by-j-m-blakley)

————————————————-

JM Blakley is a bench press specialist who wrote many insightful articles for PLUSA magazine a few years back. Here is my favorite and it’s a must-read for those who complain about not being able to gain weight. Here it is:  

**Good Eating**  
Cold, hard fact number one: If you gain weight, you will get stronger. Everybody already knows that. Even if most of the weight is not good weight, it will nevertheless have a positive effect on strength. Of course, there is the argument that the weight one gains should be quality weight (i.e. muscle, which is preferable) but the truth is that even adipose and water weight can contribute to heavier poundages lifted. It is beyond the scope of this article to address the exact physiological mechanisms for this but tissue leverage is commonly cited as the main reason for the phenomenon. My purpose is not to explain why this happens but rather to explain how to take advantage of the fact that it happens. Weight moves weight!

If you understand and accept this, you have probably tried to bulk up? Eat some point in your training. You also have probably experienced the frustration, first-hand, of just how difficult it can be to gain weight. Anyone can gain 15-20 pounds (and they often do on accident!) but that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m speaking of adding on 35-40 pounds on purpose with a combination of extra-heavy lifting and extra-heavy eating! If anyone is confused about what I’m saying here then this article is not for you. I won’t waste your time explaining and justifying the need for some lifters to put on weight. But for those of you who have been desperately trying to get your weight up and crack through a plateau, let’s get to it. Why can’t you seem to gain weight?

**DO THE MATH**  

Quite simply, you aren’t eating enough! I know, I know, you eat all the time, you eat more than everyone you know, you have a fast metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda. I know all the excuses. I used them myself. I even believed them. But there are rules in the universe. We are bound by the laws of physics and no one is pardoned. Creating a positive caloric balance is completely defined by the equation: calories in vs. calories out = calories net. That’s it. No one escapes it. If you eat more calories than you use in a day, you will gain weight. Period. There is some fluxuation for metabolic shifts and the efficiency of the body’s absorption of calories, granted, but this effect is small and it is the rare person who exhibits a metabolism that could bear the blame for one unable to manipulate their weight. More about this later, but for now get it straight- your metabolism is not to be a scapegoat for your lack of discipline. You must eat more. If your metabolism speeds up then you must eat even more to cover that. There is a limit to how fast your metabolism can run. You must stay ahead of it. And you must learn to control it. Above all, you must accept the unarguable fact that you must put more food into your mouth.  

My favorite question to ask those people who think they are eating tons of food but not gaining weight is, “what do you weigh?” Then when they answer (let’s say 195 lbs. for example) I respond “and how long have you weighed that?” They almost always answer that they have been at their current weight for over one year and often much longer. To this I quip “then you are eating enough to maintain 195 pounds. If you want to weigh 215, you need to eat more than a person who weighs 195. You have to eat like a person who weighs 215! You have proven that you eat only enough to keep your weight steady. You’ve been 195 for some time now! And what you’re eating is enough to hold that. But it’s not enough to drive it up. So if you think you’re eating all this extra food, think again. You’re eating a maintenance feed lot. You need a growth feed lot! If you’ve been eating like a 215 pounder all last year, you would weigh 215 now! You’re not eating any more than any other 195 pounder! Try harder! Eat more!” The only hole in this example is the energy output of the individual. But all things being equal, I hope you are getting the point here. You can’t gain weight if you don’t eat more.

The general principle is this: train as hard as you can to create a stimulus for growth. Then feed the body everything it needs to adapt. You must cover three needs. The recovery, the repair, and the growth. Some trainees only eat enough to recover from the last workout. They will end up overtrained because they aren’t meeting the need for repair and their tissues begin to break down under the strain of heavy lifting.
Other lifters will eat enough to recover and repair, but not enough to cover the expense of growth. These lifters end up on a constant plateau, having hard workouts, recovering from them and not overtraining, but never seeing progress. It’s a stalemate (the maintenance feed lot group). They train for years and somehow excuse the lack of results to genetics or another bogey man.
You have to cover all three aspects of nutrient need recovery, repair, and growth. First , eat enough to recover from the stress of a training session. Second, eat enough to repair any damage the workout may have caused.(If you are training very heavy, there is always micro-trauma occurring at the cellular level). Third, you must eat even more to cover the cost of your body building itself up. If you don’t eat these extra calories, where will the body get the energy to do the building? And what ,pray tell, do you suppose it will use for building material? Your body needs stuff (matter) to build with. You can’t build something out of nothing. The body needs substance to convert into body mass. That substance is food.

The only way to be absolutely certain that you are getting the most out of your workout is to eat more than you need for recovery, repair, and growth. You will begin to see a bit of bodyfat start to accumulate. Please don’t misunderstand me and think I’m telling everyone to get obesely fat. I’m only suggesting a light layer of “winter weight” or a “softening” You should never let your bodyfat percentage rise above unhealthy levels, and never put on what you can’t get off.

This is what I call bathing the cells in nutrients. You give them all they need and then a little bit extra which you can see usually around your middle. Remember; it’s OK to put it on to gain strength if you also plan to take it off later and maintain your new strength level when you diet. Just make sure you get around to dieting sooner or later! This way every workout has the nutrients it needs to give it the chance to be fully effective.
Step one is the realization that you are ,in fact, not eating enough. Some trainees will admit this but then have trouble with the work of eating. To this I say only: DISCIPLINE! You must eat on schedule. You must eat what you are supposed to. You must not excuse yourself from eating what you are supposed to when you are supposed to. This is the self same discipline that everyone recognizes the need for in losing weight. It is no different for you who would choose to gain weight. No one feels sorry for a person who says they are trying to lose a few pounds and then proceeds to attend meetings with Ronald McDonald, Ben and Jerry, and Bud Weiser. And I don’t feel sorry for those who lack the discipline to eat more.

I know how difficult it can be. But I am reminded of the time I was complaining to a friend about how hard I was trying to get my weight up to 300 pounds and how tough it was for me to eat so much, and boo-hoo-hoo. The friend looked at me, clearly fed up with my whining, and remarked “I see several people over 300 lbs at work (he was a physical therapist) and they really don’t seem to be trying all that hard! They weigh 300 and they don’t try!”

This put it in better perspective for me. I even had the advantage of working out with weights to help boost my weight and these guys were out eating me and my best effort without so much as a second thought. If people can do it on accident, I could certainly do it on purpose! And I did. So can you.

Admit that you are undereating. Then admit that you are not trying your best. I don’t believe you if you tell me you can’t eat any more than you are eating now. If you tell me you can’t eat any more, I’ll tell you that you just can’t have what you want then. (I never argue with someone who tells me they can’t). That’s the universe’s law, not mine. If you can’t do the work, you can’t have the reward. Sorry. Now, do you really mean can’t or is it more like won’t? If you want it, you can. Ask anybody who has.

Those are the two biggest roadblocks to gaining weight. Admitting that you are not doing the job and that your effort has been less than stellar, and realizing that if others can do it so can you. Once you accept those responsibilities, instead of complaining and passing the buck, you can get to the business of getting down to it. And that, my friends, is the same in all endeavors, if you are willing to pay the price, you can have the reward. I will readily admit that it seems to be easier for some than others. But the price is relative. You are not anyone else. You must not compare the ease or difficulty which you are presented to anyone else’s situation. So what if it is easier for your pal to gain weight than you? What does that have to do with you? Nothing. Your task is your task. If you must eat 400 calories more than him to get the same results, then that’s the price for you . You decide for yourself whether to pay up or not. Oh yeah, I should mention – life’s not fair. He got a discount and you got taxed. So what? You can still both have it. Are you willing to pay or not? If you’re not, you’re not. But your reason shouldn’t be because it cost you more than someone else. When someone wants something bad enough they’ll pay double! They don’t care- they are just happy to get it.

What I’m telling you is that you can gain weight if you accept the fact that it is possible and that it is going to be hard. I never said it would be easy, I only said it would be worth it. Get rid of any excuse or explanation for not gaining other than I’m not trying hard enough. I must try harder. Then you’re on your way. Blame only yourself for past shortcomings and resolve to bring whatever it takes to the table from now on.

**Tricks of the Trade: Big Boy’s Menu Plan**  

One secret is caloric density. Learn to eat foods that provide more calories per unit volume. That is, they give you lots of calories for how much space they take up in the gut. 250 calories of salad fills you up even with the dressing but a chocolate bar would only feel like a snack.
Also, add lots of condiments to your food. Carry mayo with you and add lots of it to everything. Same goes for Thousand Island dressing and chocolate sauce. Be creative and never eat anything that you don’t add calories to in some way. Melt provolone cheese over your pasta. Put ranch dressing on your pizza. Dip potato chips in honey. I don’t care what sick and twisted combinations you come up with, as long as you find it palatable. You wouldn’t believe some of the things I’ve eaten. ( Try a bowl full of peanut butter smothered in maple syrup and a stick of butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. Lay two Hershey bars over it to melt and you’ll just start to understand.)

Carry food with you. Always have a jar of peanuts in your car. Carry Pop-Tarts, Slim Jim meat snacks, candy bars, anything handy that travels well and needs no special preparation. Never get caught away from food. Put it in your desk, your locker, your gym bag, your brief case, hell, carry some around in your pockets if you have to! Never miss a meal because you couldn’t eat. What’s that? Couldn’t eat? It takes less than 50 seconds to eat two candy bars. That’s over 500 calories. Even if you have to sneak it on the job, go to the john and wolf them down. You must never be without food. Take some with you. and never say you didn’t have time (50 seconds?!) or opportunity. Find time or make time.

Eat immediately upon arising. Start right away. You lost time sleeping – you weren’t eating! Fill up first thing in the morning. Don’t wait! You went several hours without any food. The longer you wait the less time you have to get all the food your supposed to eat down. If you wait long enough it will be impossible to make it. You’ll run out of time. Get off to a solid start. Minimum first meal calories: 1200. Eat over a grand right away and the rest of the day will be easier. Eat less, and you’ll be playing catch-up all day long.
Eat just prior to bed. You are going to go for hours without food? Euel up! This is your last chance to feed your body for a long time give it one last push. This is uncomfortable for many, but with practice you will adapt and be able to eat a good calorie load before retiring. Shoot for 500 calories minimum.

Try foods you used to dislike or have never eaten before. After several weeks of overeating, everything begins to taste the same. Even your favorite foods lose their flavor. You exhaust your repertoire of choices. Open it up. Go for the calamari or the shark fin soup. Try a quiche. Eat at an ethnic restaurant. Find new favorites that you can eat lots of. I hated cottage cheese as a youngster, but now I mix it in with spaghetti and dump it into soups! I even eat the fat free variety on a reducing diet! You will surprise yourself. Don’t be afraid to try. You may still dislike salmon, but you may get a taste for artichoke after all.
Drink regular soda pop (possibly caffeine free) and whole milk. Never drink any fluids that don’t have calories. No tea without sugar, no coffee without cream and sugar, no diet beverages whatsoever. No plain water! Canned soda pop is an excellent source of purified water. But it also has precious calories. Gatorade is fine and has electrolytes as well. 108 ounces a day is the minimum. But don’t fill your stomach without putting some calories in along with. A 12 0z. can of soda pop has about 150 calories. Quench your thirst and give your body more calories at the same time. ( I’m not knocking water, folks, I’m just illustrating that you can hydrate yourself and get calories in the bargain. )

Count your calories. You may think you are consuming an abundance of food, but you’re probably giving yourself too much credit. It is very hard to eat over 5000 calories every day for weeks on end. And if its 7 or 8,000 you think you’re getting in every day I think you’d better check that. Often a trainee will eat 6,000 calories on Monday, but then stoop to 3500 or so for the next two days. Then Thursday maybe get 5500 and follow that for two days of 3000. all the while they believe that they are eating 6000 every day. Avoid this kind of fluxuation. Keep a solid average. And keep track. At least for a series of days every now and then. A few days a month check up on yourself. If your goal is 5500 calories a day add it all up and make sure. You’ll soon get better at estimating and you won’t have to go through this so much. But take my advice, if you are not seeing the scale move the way you think it should, double check your count. You most likely are overestimating your intake. This gives you feedback so you can make adjustments. Even if you’re an old pro at calorie counting it’s a good idea to take account every so often.

**Issues and Precautions**  

This kind of diet is admittedly not the most conducive to your overall health. But we should get one thing straight – you are not doing it for health reasons, you are doing it for better performance in your chosen sport. This is one of those “quality of life” issues. You choose to pursue powerlifting because of reasons other than improved health such as challenge, personal pride, self esteem benefits, sense of strength, or any other of a basket full of psycho/emotional reasons not to mention the sheer fun of it! There are plenty of health benefits to the sport of powerlifting and weight training in general which have all been outlined many times before. I acknowledge those, of course, I’m just saying that if you are competing and trying to bulk up, you probably have more personal motives for continuing to put so much into this sport. And those motives most likely supersede any health benefits.

Having said that, let me turn the table back on your health. This style of diet can have very serious effects on your body. One effect is a dramatic improvement in your strength. But another effect is an increase in your blood cholesterol level! It would be irresponsible of me to ignore the down side? So I’ll give a few suggestions of what I feel is prudent and responsible behavior that would accompany such an eating program. (It’s all common sense, anyway!)

Have your cholesterol checked before you begin. Get a baseline. If you have high levels, you may want to reconsider and see your doctor about options to lower it.

Check your cholesterol every 15-20 pounds that you gain. Or every 10 weeks on the diet. Set a limit with your doctor as to how high you will permit it to rise and remain on the diet. If it goes above such-and-such a number, abort.

Do some form of cardiovascular exercise. Minimum 3 days per week. I know you don’t want to spend the precious calories on cardio, but the cv exercise will help keep the cholesterol down as well as abating some of the inevitable sluggishness that comes with weight gain. I’ve done it both with and without cv and I feel much, much better with a daily walk. And you can eat just one more snickers bar to cover it. All the while your heart gets some exercise and your metabolism doesn’t get so loggy.

Check your blood pressure at the start and then every four days while on the diet. Get your own monitor or find one of the countless free places that you can have it taken for you. Use the same equipment every time. Expect some increase in bp. Consult your doctor and make a decision as to what you both will tolerate. If your bp goes past the limit you have set, abort.

Issues of sleep apnea can develop. This is a tough disorder in which you interrupt your breathing for a few seconds all through the night and wake up in the morning exhausted from gasping for 8 hours! This affects a huge number of people in the US but commonly is made worse by gaining weight. If it affects you, you may not know it?You’re asleep while it’s going on. But sooner or later someone will tell you, your wife, your girlfriend, your next-door neighbor. It’s often confused for a bad case of snoring. But after a couple of weeks of full nights rest and an accompanying deep fatigue, you will begin to suspect something is wrong. I wish I had some sort of fix-it for this but the only advice I can give is to try propping yourself up at a slight incline when you sleep and put up with it as much as your significant other will allow. If it is too much of a problem, seek medical attention and decide what else to try. If you must, abort. You won’t see the progress you want in your training if you’re not getting the rest you need.

Have a full blood work up done (this will most likely accompany your cholesterol but ask for it any way. These days health care professionals are cutting costs and if you ask for cholesterol values that may be all that gets run!). Of special interest are : triglycerides, liver enzymes, thyroid levels especially T-4 and TSH, and any values having to do with pancreatic function. These can become upset with drastic changes in dietary habits and need an eye kept on them.

Measure your bodyfat percentage. Set a limit to how high you will let it go. Remeasure it every 10 pounds you gain. See how many pounds are muscle and how many are fat. A good bargain is 1 pound of muscle for every 2-3 lbs of fat.
If you are a master lifter, consider your medications and consult your doctor about the effect weight gain may have on any of them especially heart meds. Your dosage may need to be adjusted.

Remember that the weight gain is to be temporary. You should plan a reducing diet to follow at a specified time in your training. This is where you attempt to maintain most of the new strength you amassed during the bulking phase while lowering your body fat to the same level you started at. You are not training to get stronger, only to hold the strength you have while dropping the excess. Commit yourself to the goal of returning to your starting level of bodyfat and see how much of the new strength you’re kept. If you diet right, it should be above 80%. So that is your true gain. The gain you keep after gaining and losing the excess bodyfat is what counts. If you gain 20 lbs on your bench and lose 15 when you diet, you missed the point. If you gain 20 lbs on the bench and keep 15 (16) you’ve achieved something and done it correctly. Now repeat this process as necessary!! I suggest that you only hold your weight heavy for no longer than 5-6 months before you diet back down. Each time you repeat this process, you will hold more strength and have more muscle mass than before. Avoid staying heavy too long. It is only temporary!

These things will help you minimize the risks associated with the rigors of body weight manipulation. Competitive sports all have risks. Every highschooler who puts on a football helmet on Friday night and knocks heads with the cross-town rivals takes the risk of spinal injury. Risks are unavoidable and usually increase with the level of play. Just be responsible. Take care of yourself within the risks. Do what you can to minimize them. Pay attention. If you don’t watch your blood pressure, how do you know if you might not be begging for a stroke? For Christmas sake, at least know what you’re levels are. You can always decide to do what is right for you. Continue or stop. Or continue on a different course. But at least do the best you can to stay as healthy as you can.

Remember: If you want to beat the man, you’ve got to out-eat the man!

ifd11x,gainit,How to bulk while living in a dorm - a beginner's guide,"Hey, you. Skinny freshman. Yes, that’s right. You.

I hear you’re tired of feeling weak and skinny at 18 years young. I hear you want to pack on some muscle mass. I hear you want to enter the adult world as a strong, ripped, chiseled beast.

Well, I can help. I can offer the advice of a grizzled veteran, one who lived in a dorm with no stovetop or oven as you live in now. And I managed to figure out how to eat big and get big.

Everything in this list can be stored, prepared, and consumed within a standard college dorm room in under 15 minutes, assuming you have access to a microwave and minifridge. More importantly, a lot of the stuff on this list is common sense.

As a bonus, there’s a section on advanced dorm cooking techniques (i.e., ones that require appliances).

So if you’re ready, let’s begin.

# THE DINING HALL

If you have a meal plan, use it and abuse it to the full extent of the law. Get seconds. Thirds. Fourths. Bum spare meal swipes off your buddies. Grab a bagel on your way out. Smuggle fruit and slices of pizza out if you need to. The calorie and protein count of each food item should be listed somewhere, probably online. Find it, and eat according to your needs.

Don’t sleep on the salad bar, either. The salad bar is often overlooked by aspiring bodybuilders. “Where’s the chicken breast,” they say. But they miss out on what the salad bar has to offer- peas, shredded cheese, pepperoni, deli meats, and most importantly, VEGETABLES. Eat your greens, kiddos. I have heard many a tale of a wee lad freshman who succumbed to scurvy because mommy wasn’t there to remind him to eat his Brussel sprouts and spinach.

# PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICHES

A a good PB (jelly optional) sandwich is a good 300-400 calories and 10-20 grams of protein a whack. I recommend [Dave’s Killer 21 Whole Grains bread](http://www.daveskillerbread.com/21-whole-grains-and-seeds)\- a little expensive, but 110 calories and 5 grams of protein PER SLICE? It’s worth it to me. Any peanut butter will do. Just slather that baby up with a generous amount of PB and munch on it while studying.

# TRAIL MIX

You would be surprised how fantastic trail mix is, both taste-wise and nutritionally. Get you some of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Garden-Healthy-Trail-Snack/dp/B07D5BCH7D/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=individual+trail+mix+packets&qid=1598221794&sr=8-6) or something similar, or just a big bag of the stuff. Put a couple servings into Ziploc bags and munch on them during lectures.

# OATMEAL

Oatmeal is the shit. There’s a couple ways to prepare it.

One, if you have a Keurig, get you some of [these](https://www.quakeroats.com/products/hot-cereals/instant-oatmeal-cups) bad boys, fill up your Keurig with water and no pod, and let ‘er rip. (Pro tip- let your Keurig run a cycle with no pod in it once to clear out any lingering coffee, and then use the second cycle for your oatmeal.)

Two, if you only have a microwave, [these](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Instant-Oatmeal-Original-10-Pouch/dp/B00FNP1IQ2/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&keywords=microwaveable+oatmeal+packets&qid=1598221912&sr=8-12) will do just fine as well. A variety of flavors to choose from, and super easy to make.

Sounds pretty simple to me, you may say. And you’re right. So let’s spice up our oatmeal with a nice scoop of peanut butter. Or, ever better, pour some of that sweet aforementioned trail mix in. OR, better STILL, do both. 200-300 calories of oatmeal, 150 calories of peanut butter, and 150 calories of trail mix brings you to a lovely 500-600 calorie breakfast that takes like 5 minutes to prepare. A little carb and sugar heavy, but so it goes.

Too sugary? Well, then how about some SAVORY oatmeal? Just prep your normal quick oats, and toss in some shredded cheese, precooked bacon, salt, and pepper. Plenty of recipes online for this.

# RAMEN

The standard “broke college student” meal can be upgraded in a variety of ways- it’s just noodles, after all. To make your life easier, get you one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Rapid-Ramen-Cooker-Microwave-Dishwasher/dp/B00H8BFGPI/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=ramen+cooker+helper&qid=1598221434&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A3T0HRZE8TWY0J&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE4NE0zMTJTUU9MMFAmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA3NDc4MjcyWDdCS1c3MDg0OFNEJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA1OTE3MTkxMzE3VUVSWEU2MVVTJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) from Amazon.

# ADVANCED DORM COOKING

Let’s say the above recipes and foods aren’t cutting it. You need more. What are some compact, easy-to-use cooking accessories that you can use to enhance your diet? (Note- check in your resident handbook that the following devices are allowed. Some colleges prohibit these types of items.)

How about a [mini rice cooker](https://www.amazon.com/DRCM200BK-Steamer-Removable-Nonstick-Function/dp/B07CHZP91L/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=mini+rice+cooker&qid=1598221551&sr=8-3), in which one may cook white and brown rice, quinoa, pasta, and more? (A dorm room favorite of mine was to make white rice, mix in two or three packets of tuna, and drizzle soy sauce on top.)

How about a [George Foreman grill](https://www.amazon.com/George-Foreman-4-Serving-Removable-GRP1060B/dp/B00KDVJLJW/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=30H49AR5BMZ03&dchild=1&keywords=george+foreman+grill&qid=1598221585&sprefix=george+fore%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVDNTRDE1QlhYNENDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjkyMDk0MlpIV1ROQTEyRE1XMSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTYzMTgxMUEzU05XT09XMVhLWSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=), in which one may grill succulent and juicy chicken breasts?

How about a [mini blender](https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Personal-Smoothies-Blending-700-Watt/dp/B01FHOWYA2/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=magic+bullet&qid=1598221606&sr=8-3), the ultimate shake/smoothie/mass gainer creator? (Shake idea- 1 cup of milk, ½ frozen banana, 1 scoop of ice cream, 2 tbsps of peanut butter, 1 scoop of protein powder, 1 tbsp of olive oil, 1 tbsp of honey. About 800-900 calories and 40-50 grams of protein- and it actually tastes decent.)

# CONCLUSION

You can eat plenty of food in college, especially if you get up in time to make it to breakfast in the dining hall. That was something big for me as a freshman- getting up and allowing myself enough time to eat at least three solid meals a day was very important.

This guide is by no means comprehensive. I encourage any other current or previous college students to share their shortcuts and life hacks for making gainz in school.

Godspeed to ye, lads, and good luck in your studies. May your pumps be fierce and your gainz even fiercer.",2020-08-23 22:42:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ifd11x/how_to_bulk_while_living_in_a_dorm_a_beginners/

Workouts:

4-5x a week, for 1-1.5 hours

2-3 months Push Pull Legs

1 month of Chest & Triceps, Back & Biceps, Legs & Shoulders ""bro split""

Repeat, each rotation moving between heavy weight and 8 reps, moderate weight and 10 reps, and lighter weight with 12 reps.  Keep the muscles adapting by mixing up rep count and slowly progressing.  Mix in abs 2-3x a week, 2-4 exercises.

&#x200B;

Eating:

I did not get too obsessed with counting calories, rather watched what kind of food I put in my body.  Avoided packaged fatty/sugary foods and soft drinks.  I drink mainly water(A LOT) and black coffee.  Lots of grilled chicken and fish, with rice or pasta and veggies.  I avoided snacking at nights.

**Contexto and bio**

Hello! I'm a physical education teacher, from Europe, and i always felt skinny! I never liked to go to the beach because of my appearance and even being graduated from a sports science degree i never felt confident to hit the gym. Last november, i said to myself ""that's enough"" and started to going to gym and starting to eat a lot more than i used to. My progress is not fantastic, but i like the way i look right now, compared to how i looked before. The feeling of tightness of tshirts sleeves around my arms and the shorts on my legs it's amazing.

**Personal Data**

*Weight before:* 136 lbs (62kg)

*Current Weight:* 154 lbs (70kg)

*Height:* 5'77 (176 cm)

Age: 28

**Diet**

In the end of the day, i think diet it's the most important thing. Along the way, i tracked my calories and macros and measured my food. I tried to eat at least 2 grams of protein per kg, so in total around 150 grams of protein. The only supplements that i took were creatine (3g /day) and whey protein (isolate). Along the way i tried to eat clean, but it wasn't always possible. My meals were essentially chicken, rice, pasta, beef, fruit and some vegetables. Nothing fancy! The thing that help me the most were morning shakes with milk, protein powder, peanut butter, oats and coffee beans. I could easily hit my main goal for the day (around 3000 kcal) with the help of protein shakes.

I noticed that i gained, in the beggining, a lot of fat (the caloric surplus was higher than it should be), so in the last 2 months i was in [Body Recomposion](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/body-recomposition) phase where i lost a little bit of fat and gained some muscle.

**Training**

I started with a full body workout split (A & B / 3x /week) and later on moved to a UPPER LOWER SPLIT:

***ADDITIONAL AND IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING THE TRAINING and NUTRITION:***

1. I skipped some training sessions as motivation wasn't always high, and that's okay.

2. I took [deload](https://builtwithscience.com/deload-week/) weeks (usually after 4 weeks of intense training).

3. I only did cardio for warm up as i hate cardio (5 minutes).

4. I did some warmup dynamic exercises before each workout session.

5. Never tried to test my 1RM as i don't care about that.

6. I used a [Double Progresson Method](https://www.niashanks.com/double-progression-method/).

7. I never pulled my self to failure in any training session. My [RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)](https://www.healthline.com/health/RPE) was always around 7-8.

8. I used ""Strong"" App to track my workout sessions in order to apply progressive overload.

9. I used the app ""My Fitness Pal"" to track my diet.

10. I did a lot of ""cheat meals"". In the end what counted the most was calories for me as long i was hitting the protein goal.

11. I tried to drink a lot of water and tried to have, at least, 8 hours of sleep each day.

**WORKOUT - WEIGHT LIFTED (NUMBERS)**

As i never calculated or tried 1RM, these numbers are for 8 reps, with good form and with a RPE of around 7-8. I now they're not huge numbers, but i fell proud of them:

1. Deadlift (75kg - 165 lbs)

2. Squat (70kg - 154 lbs)

3. Bench Press (45kg - 99 lbs)

4. Overhead Press (30kg - 66 lbs)

5. Pullups - bodyweight (12 reps)

6. Dips - bodyweight (12 reps)

**DISCLAIMER:**

1. Although i have some knowledge of sports science in general, do not take this post as advice for you, since every person has different needs. I did not created these workouts, i followed some people with scientific approach on training in the internet and it worked with me. I will not mention his names because i think it's not allowed here in the sub. I only cared about the scientific//biomechanical approach behind each exercise and the diet.

2. I used google to make the conversion between KG and LBS, as here we use kg. Some values maybe are wrong.

3. English it's not my native language, so sorry for some incorrect phrases or words.

I'm eating a surplus of 300-500 cals / day.

 A lot of people seem to suggest they struggle to eat at their surplus, but now that i'm used to it, i feel i could easily eat more without feeling stuffed. I don't go through the day hungry but neither do i have that discomfort that a lot of people describe when bulking. 

I am being kinda conservative with my calories as i am trying to keep the bulk as lean as possible but am wondering if i can get away with eating more while still minimising fat gain given my feelings of fullness (or not)?

I am 183cm, currently about 61kg having started from 59kg in November.

Cold instant coffee w/ one muffin - (Breakfast / 242 calories)

* Picture is not here because I had the idea to do this right before lunch. Just imagine one chocolate muffin with a tall cup of cold coffee.

Every morning that I wake up I always make instant coffee with milk. I whip this up in under 30 seconds and I practically chug my coffee. I skip regular breakfast because I don't like eating very early & I eat sweets every morning to give me that kickstart for the beginning of the day when I am most productive. I also skip normal breakfast to get in the mindset of faux-intermittent fasting when I cut.

___

https://i.imgur.com/RTeAl0n.jpg - (Lunch / 1562 calories)

* Two tomatoes (44 calories);

* 130g of cheese (286 cal / 17.5g protein);

* 130g of bacon (714 cal / 50.9g protein);

* 65g of processed sausage (277 cal / 14.3g protein);

* 50g of sesame & flax plates (241 cal / 3.7g protein).

Total protein: 86.4g

I always have a big lunch whether I am cutting or whether I am bulking. Skipping breakfast allows me to do this easily regardless and I love having big lunches as they power me through the day. I eat smoked bacon on most days when I bulk because it is the perfect food for bulking and yes it is a hill I am willing to fuckin' die on, don't @ me. >:( **If you aren't eating bacon you are making it so much harder on yourself.** I argued in the past and I will argue again, bacon is the #1 gain food. But no, people will tell me that bacon is bad for you because of the fat content and then they'd be like ""anyway lemme give you one of my shakers recipe where it consists of ONE CUP OF OIL to make it easier to gain"".

Anyway, is 1500 calories a lot? Yes, of course it is. But I ate this, walked for a couple minutes and I didn't feel bloated. You can eat 1000+ calories meals without feeling like you're gonna explode IF you walk it off.

https://i.imgur.com/W8ssnv4.jpg?1 - (Before Gym / 485 calories)

* One banana (108 cal / 27.9g carbs);

* Two honey peaches (117 cal / 28.6g carbs);

* 300g of watermelon (92 cal / 23g carbs);

* 250g of grapes (168 cal / 42.9g carbs).

Total carbs: 122.4g

Yes, that is a lot of fruit and I usually don't eat this much but I had a craving for it before gym so I did it. **That is the whole basis of my diet: if I want to I will do it. I put zero restrictions on myself other than moderation to some degree.**

I always eat fruit regardless about an hour to hour and half before going to the gym, and I always eat a banana regardless of anything else. Banana is a high calorie food with plenty of carbs and you should definitely eat it whether you are bulking or cutting.

(Also, the honey peaches were so damn sweet I just had to take two. I honestly could eat twenty of those in one sitting. They're so damn good.)

___

https://i.imgur.com/ALS9ACV.jpg?1 - (After Gym / 695 calories)

* One protein shake (280 cal / 33g protein);

* 60g of a mixture of honey, almonds & walnuts (316 cal / 6g protein);

* A few ""cookies"" (not really, pretty healthy) from my country (99 cal / 2.7g protein).

Total protein: 41.7g

I used to take protein with my coffee upon waking up but I realize that, throughout the day, I happen to sometimes overshoot on protein. On some days, I don't even have a protein shake, I can make it up with regular food. I use milk to make my protein shake with one scoop because using water is just god awful and I don't recommend it unless you're lactose intolerant or w/e.

I have one protein shake and that is it. Most of my calories (90%+) come from regular food and stuff.

PS: The small mixture of almonds, honey and walnuts is only worth 316 calories. The recipe is one large freshly squeezed lemon, 400g of honey, 300g of walnuts and 100g of almonds all blended up together. The last time I posted this, people said ""thats a lot of honey"". Yes. Its a lot of honey. You're trying to gain. Shut up, lmao.

___

https://i.imgur.com/28cKv9b.jpg?1 - (Dinner / 874 calories)

* Stew (approx. 481 cal / 35.3g protein);

* Three boiled eggs (210 cal / 18g protein);

* Buckwheat sticks (183 cal / 6.3g protein)

* A really big hot pepper (idk / 1g protein? - Honestly didn't calculate this because the calories can be so insignificant when it comes to small portions of veggies)

Total protein: 60.6g

As you can see, the majority of protein content for my day comes from lunch & dinner (140ish grams) + the protein shake if I need it. On some days I eat protein heavy lunch and dinner to the point that I don't feel the need to make a protein shake (happens when you are bulking at 3500+ calories and trying not to overshoot on protein).

PS: Yes, that is a hot pepper and, yes, it was really spicy (near the end). I ate it whole tho.. because I really love eating spicy food.

___

**Total Calories & Macros**

* Calories: 3858

* 329g Carbs (34%);

* 198g Fat (46%);

* 199g Protein (20%).

Fat makes up at least 50% of my diet on most days. I don't believe in bulking where carbs make the most of someone's diet because they're less dense per gram. When I bulk, my carbs are about 30 something percent but when I cut they go to about 10 - 20% with fat overtaking it.

**Calories lost**

* From walking & running: 814 calories

* From gym: 488 calories

* Total lost: 1302 calories

Yep. You've read that right. I burned 814 calories through WALKING and running. Now, keep in mind, I only ran for about 10-15 minutes because I was going to be late somewhere. I walked for about hour and something later, so I will put this in big letters.

**IF YOU ARE TRACKING CALORIES, DO NOT FORGET TO TRACK CALORIES BURNED THROUGH WALKING.**

A person can burn an INSANE amount of calories from just walking. Do you know how much I have to walk to burn 550 calories? **One hour and 30 minutes without pause.** Do not underestimate calories burned from walking, just because you aren't panting for air does not mean that walking isn't just destroying your gains. If you have a Samsung, you should have a tracker installed. Keep it on at ALL times and you will see just how much you burn through walking. I am not sure about iPhones, there are some apps called Pedometers which are step calculators (although the Samsung one is really great because it can differentiate between running & walking calories while some pedometers can't).

If you are trying to bulk but you don't know why you are not gaining, it is very worth to check out walking calories.

___

Bulk: 3858 - 2130 (BMR) - 1302 = **426 calories**

As you can see, the bulk with 3858 calories for me only turns about to be approx. 426 calories surplus. As a 6'7"" man who moves a lot and burns a lot, I eat this amount to SLOW bulk.

___

Other food I eat on my bulk: Literally fucking anything. I eat sweets, I do stuff people say not to do yet not only am I bulking but I am able to be normal in social situations without people thinking I am a health nut when they offer me something sweet to eat. You can do this too, if you'd like. You really don't have to be ultra clean as much as you don't have to be ultra dirty, hence why I call it **a stain bulk**. It's not perfect but it is EXTREMELY sustainable and at the end of the day sustainability is the MOST important part when it comes to stuff like this.

Pros: I can eat and drink whatever the fuck I want (except I try to avoid alcohol whenever I can and on the vast majority of days I don't get a sip).

Cons: I have to weigh it, plan stuff out and try my best to be accurate.

The pros outweigh the cons. I use a food scale for everything that I can weigh and the things I can't really weigh (like the stew) I eyeball it approx. and calculate in MyFitnessPal a division of the amount of plates I could get. But I eat whatever I want, really, and I try to find a balance between fun food vs healthy food.",2019-08-22 13:32:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ctxhyt/stain_bulk_example_of_what_i_ate_yesterday_to/

Any time I try to eat I get full off of eating barely any food. I just forced myself to eat half a breakfast burrito even though I had this ""pit"" feeling in my stomach. Not a feeling of being hungry but almost like I'm sick to my stomach and eating anything will make it worse. 

I eat like 1-2 meals a day usually. Yesterday I had 1 1/2 pb&js(went on a 4 mile hike) from like 8 to noon(stopped and ate occasionally/slowly). No breakfast. I ate half a turkey/avocado/bacon sandwich around 4 and got full. Finished the later half around 8 and didn't eat until this morning around 9 when I ate half that burrito and a cup of coffee. You'd  think I'd be starving but I got basically sick to my stomach and didn't want to eat. What's weird is I got hunger pains this morning but when I actually tried to eat I couldn't.

Do you guys have the same issue? How do you deal with it? I know I need to eat but the idea of stuffing my face with food makes me want to puke. I want to gain weight so bad I'm tired of always being cold and full after eating barely anything.

cpylg3,gainit,I [M30] got injured when I finally started getting bigger. Injury struck - now I’m weak and in pain. Anyone else?,"Hey folks,

Celebrating my 30th birthday in pain was not exactly what I was hoping for when I started lifting weights two years ago.

I was never a gym guy, but got very excited once I had my food and programming in place and things started happening. Unfortunately last summer, I started feeling something was wrong in my shoulders. Fast forward a few weeks, and I had shoulder, elbow and wrist pain that persists to this day with some cracking (although full ROM which I have had all along).

The diagnosis on the ultrasound was rotator cuff tendinosis, both sides. That is what you get for using a bro-gram with only glory muscle exercises, and not paying as much attention to form as you should. Lesson learned.

Due to busy studies and life, I was not able to consistently work on PT or corrective exercises this past year. I had some acupuncture and Chinese medicine on it - felt good but did not help. I saw my body, that I was finally proud of, shrink and wither away as I got more and more depressed. 
Add on intense post-grad studies, too much weed and bad food, and you'll end up with a disaster. 
I like to call it my ""reversed recomp"", and I certainly look the part still.

Now to my current circumstances;
I was excited to land a job a few months ago and moved to a west coast town where life is slow and health/wellness is high on the agenda. Finally, time to fix my shoulder pain!
Nope. Just when I had found a well renowned functional trainer to begin working on my shoulders, my knees started fucking with me, so that has been essentially all we have been working on since.

Snapping, popping, sucking/tight feeling in the kneecap. I go to the kitchen for a cup of coffee, I hear audible clicks. Occasional pain, laterally and just above the knee cap. My trainer says its the IT band and has put me on a realignment program that also, eventually, will include the shoulders and upper body. He has identified some basic postural issues, that according to him ""isn't anything big or unusual"". I have had weekly sessions where we dial in my form on the exercises. They feel minute and like they do not really do anything for me.

The shoulder- and elbow pain persists. I get daily reminders when I go to dry my hair with a towel, or even push open a door. The physical impact the pain has on me is nowhere near the emotional pain I feel from this.

I finally have time to do something about it, but it is very hard to keep going when I genuinely don't believe I will ever be able to beat this. I have never felt so weak and incapable, and I admit feeling very defeated that I now have to deal with dysfunctional knees as well. What's next - back pain too?

I'd like to hear if anyone on here can identify with anything I am saying, or know of anyone who was able to beat chronic pain at this stage in life (30 years).
I am interested in building functional strength and muscle, and I know many members here are very knowledgeable and have given great advice in the past.

I realize this comes down to grit, motivation, and attitude. I am working on them as hard as I can, I trust my trainer, but some days the pain gets the best of me.
This is one of those days.

Thanks for reading.

TLDR; I am 30 and came down with rotator cuff injuries a year ago. After that, I have just gotten in more and more pain.

c1sgv4,gainit,JM Blakely's weight gain/plateau breaking diet (of Dave Tate/Elitefts fame) explained (going from 280lbs to 308+),"Gainers,

Once again, my love for this topic compels me to share stories with you, and hopefully stir some dialogue. 

There is a diet that has existed in infamy across the web for over a decade now: JM Blakely's weight gaining diet employed by Dave Tate to go from 280lbs to 308+.

To hear a video description and get some solid pointers on implementing it, check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCy3V5SuQio) (I've already skipped to the part where they talk about it)

To see the [text version explained...](https://www.t-nation.com/training/37-tips-and-tales-from-dave-tate)

>“For breakfast you need to eat four of those breakfast sandwiches from McDonalds. I don’t care which ones you get, but make sure to get four. Order four hash browns, too. Now grab two packs of mayonnaise and put them on the hash browns and then slip them into the sandwiches. Squish that shit down and eat. That’s your breakfast.”


>At this point I’m thinking this guy is nuts. But he’s completely serious.
“For lunch you’re gonna eat Chinese food. Now I don’t want you eating that crappy stuff. You wanna get the stuff with MSG. None of that non-MSG bullshit. I don’t care what you eat but you have to sit down and eat for at least 45 minutes straight. You can’t let go of the fork. Eat until your eyes swell up and become slits and you start to look like the woman behind the counter.”


>“For dinner you’re gonna order an extra-large pizza with everything on it. Literally everything. If you don’t like sardines, don’t put 'em on, but anything else that you like you have to load it on there. After you pay the delivery guy, I want you to take the pie to your coffee table, open that fucker up, and grab a bottle of oil. It can be olive oil, canola oil, whatever. Anything but motor oil. And I want you to pour that shit over the pie until half of the bottle is gone. Just soak the shit out of it.”
“Now before you lay into it, I want you to sit on your couch and just stare at that fucker. I want you to understand that that pizza right there is keeping you from your goals.”


>This guy is in a zen-like state when he’s talking about this.
“Now you’re on the clock,” he continues. ""After 20 minutes your brain is going to tell you you’re full. Don’t listen to that shit. You have to try and eat as much of the pizza as you can before that 20-minute mark. Double up pieces if you have to. I’m telling you now, you’re going to get three or four pieces in and you’re gonna want to quit. You fucking can’t quit. You have to sit on that couch until every piece is done.


>And if you can’t finish it, don’t you ever come back to me and tell me you can’t gain weight. 'Cause I’m gonna tell you that you don’t give a fuck about getting bigger and you don’t care how much you lift!""

> Did I do it? Hell yeah. Started the next day and did it for two months. Went from 260 pounds to 297 pounds. And I didn’t get much fatter. One of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life, though.""

Left out of that text (but included in the original ""King and the Crown"" article published in ""Gym Talk"" from Elitefts and in the video as well) is that, every 2 hours, you eat 2 Hershey's chocolate bars.  It's these bars in particular because they're just chocolate, no nuts or anything, which means you can just break them apart and have them melt into your mouth.  No chewing or eating required, which will be good, because you probably won't want to eat anything.  This is supposed to keep your blood sugar constantly jacked up.




Some of the big takeaways from this.

* You probably don't eat nearly as much as you think you do, and you CAN eat way more, if you make that your goal.

* ""Palatability"" and calories per bite are key.  You want food that goes down easy and makes your efforts worth it.  For example, that pizza is a hyper palatable food, while the oil on top makes it more calorie dense.

* There's always a way to get in more calories.  Those chocolate bars are a genius idea.

* BIG TAKEAWAY: This is not a FOREVER diet.  It's touched on in the video, and anyone with a lick of common sense should pick that up, but some dummy always likes to say something stupid like ""This will make you die before you turn 40!""  Not if it's only followed for 6 weeks.  The point is to just shock your system and kickstart growth when you've hit a stall.

bz1aah,gainit,"Lifted for 1 year, no progress for many months","I have been doing starting strength 5x5 for about 1 year by now, i progressed real good the first few months i think, or at least hope, from 20kg bench to 50kg bench in like a month or two. So anyhow, my current stats are 70kg bench press 1 rep, OHP 50kg one rep, squat 52kg 1 rep or so, deadlift 45kg 1 rep, 5x5 chinup with added 15kg, bicep curl 10kg 3x10, not sure about one rep max. My bodyweight is 77kg, my height is 183cm, my age is 20.

&#x200B;

So these are kinda the stats i have been stuck with for many months, never progressing at all, just staying stagnant. I do my best in the gym, i get really tired when i work out, i do my best, but i never progress, i never skip a single gym day. I haven't skipped a single gym day this year besides the two days i had a cold, but that's it, i never skip gym, never ever. I always eat clean, i do not drink alcohol, i do not eat candy, i do not eat fast food, i do not drink coffee, i do not do drugs, i do not masturbate or have sex, i do not eat sugary delicacies like cake or coffee bread, no soy, no milk as in drinking a glass of milk. I always eat clean, just my meals and water, creatine and whey. So this year when i lifted this has been my ""diet"", i eat one regular meal at 12:00, another regular meal at about 17:00, just regular meals, like potatoes and meat, or rice and meat, or meat and potatoes, or meat and rice, that's it. Then one scoop of whey every day for protein. One spoon of creatine in the morning, one spoon of creatine in the evening.

I use to box so I have always been lean and fought between 64-69kg, so this is my first attempt at bulking properly. Most of my friends are boxers so don't have much experience on the weight lifting side of thing so not entirely sure where to get advice from!

&#x200B;

I am constantly bloated and my stomach just sticks out - does this fade after a while? I thought after changing my eating habits the bloat would have died down by now? 

&#x200B;

For reference my diet is:

Breakfast:

Bagel + PB + Black Coffee

&#x200B;

Morning snack:

Serious mass (half serving)

Fruit

&#x200B;

Lunch:

Chicken/Fish

Rice/Pasta

Vegetables 

&#x200B;

Afternoon Snack/meal:

Same as lunch (but smaller portion)

&#x200B;

Workout (Usually get home around 9pm). (Following PHUL program with added exercises to combat imbalances)

&#x200B;

Post workout

Other half of Serious mass half serving

&#x200B;

Dinner:

6 Scrambled eggs + 3 or 4 Toast (Quick and easy as I get home late)

&#x200B;

I also drink a lot of green tea throughout the day if that is of any relevance

&#x200B;

Is my diet causing me to bloat? Or Is this just apart of the bulk, and I am being impatient and should I weight a bit longer?

Im thinking, that besides  the alcohol and stuff I should also clean myself from red meat as well as coffee. I go to the gym so my main concern is how not to lose muscle. I don't drink protein shakes but maybe I should try them.

It’s been really hard trying to get calories in, I have braces so hard nuts like almonds and walnuts are off limit. I can only fit prob 1100 calories a day here’s what I eat usually;

Breakfast: Black Coffee, Maple brown sugar oatmeal with a tablespoon of peanut butter: 185 calories

Lunch: a chopped banana with a tablespoon of peanut butter, some potato chips with nutritional yeast on them, some crackers, and a glass of milk; 570 calories

Dinner: I usually have some type of meat and sometimes rice, so let’s say a piece of steak and a cup of rice: 203 calories

At dinner I’m usually just getting home from the gym after an hour and 30 minute workout and too tired to really make something that will give me more calories. As for breakfast, I could add something small that will add more calories..may I also add that I can’t have dairy or lots of sugar due to my intolerance of those..cheese is fine though in moderation.

1mui6wi,loseit,Even if I don’t keep snacks in the house - i still find ways to eat??,"25F, 5’4 and 160lbs and trying to lose a good 20lbs. Tried counting my calories but I either forget or just get into a binge type eating cycle.

When I was about 21 or 22 I was at my thinnest, I believe 125 lbs. Most was due to anxiety and not eating, so then I went on medication (zoloft) and since then gained a good 40 pounds. Now I tapered off my anxiety meds as I initially thought they were the cause. But I’m feeling okay anxiety wise but now struggling with my eating.

Everyone has the tip of “do not buy snacks” which thought would be great for me as I live alone and could save the money. But NOPE. I make everything that’s sitting in my fridge or pantry! 

I will physically get up, make cookies, brownies, etc. from scratch. Make anything in the air fryer, so things in my freezer - in which I even stopped buying fries and deep fried stuff. But I still manage to make whatever is left in there. I do buy fruits and veggies which I eat lots of. 

I usually get an iced coffee sugar free when I go out but end up buying a small snack with it too. So obviously that needs to stop. Some of socializing with friends is through going and trying new restaurants or cafes (which is usually once every week). 

The issue is that my brain automatically just goes right to food and I don’t even realize it till I’m already half way cooking/baking. Then I feel awful about myself. 

Like I’ll basically eat anything. I also work from home and I tend to do lots of hobbies that are at home. Hard to distract myself when much of my work and hobbies are in my own home. 

I haven’t really found anyone bring up that they just unconsciously start eating? Everywhere on tiktok, Reddit etc. just say to cut out snacks to stop it. 

I know working out will be one of the tips, but that can only go so far. A workout does not distract my brain.

1muf6oe,loseit,Sugar-free candy is not worth it,"Not a fact, an opinion. But I think this is not talked about enough.

Yes, sugar is bad for you in bad amounts or in moderate amounts but consumed daily. Yes, you should avoid typical stuff with sugar. But the thing is: you should avoid sugary stuff *and replace it with non processed foods!* I'm not talking about sugar added by you, like for coffee, because 1) the product is not processed, it's just coffee or tea 2) saccharin, sucralose and aspartame are far more common as table sweeteners than polyols. I'm talking about candy, ice cream, pastries...

TMI: >!**sugar-free farts are DEADLY.**!<You don't need to eat a super high amount to get them. Just 40 grams of SF milk chocolate and then bammm! And you save, what, 50 calories (comparing normal vs SF)

It's great to find healthier alternatives, and certainly most SF beverages just have aspartame or sucralose so they are safe (unless you suffer from PKU), but you just can't find something super sweet and also low in any sweetener. Any sweetener comes with a price. Most of them are polyols or fibers like inulin, which make you gassy. Want ice cream? Eat the real one. Want some Kinder Bueno? Buy a pair of bars and enjoy it, then move on. Most SF substitutes are too high price, make you gassy and also make you think you can eat more of them because they are ""safe"".

Yesterday I ate like 130 g of hazelnut chocolate spread (don't ask me how I know the amount) in a sitting, part in a sandwich and the other just by the spoon. I became a little bloated and woke up >!farting a lot!<. But I've felt way worse after eating a normal amount of sugar free chocolate.

TL;DR: treat yourself with your fav candy instead of overindulging on sugar free stuff you don't even enjoy.",2025-08-19 11:00:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1muf6oe/sugarfree_candy_is_not_worth_it/

* Breakfast: Greek yogurt (120g), peanut butter (20g), honey (15g) and oat bran (30g). Instant coffee with a splash of milk.
* Pre-workout: 4 wholegrain crackers, two kiwi fruit and a scoop of [green juice powder](https://www.nuzest.co.nz/products/good-green-vitality).
* Post-workout: Oats (40g), 1 cup of water, blueberries (40g), peanut butter (20g), a banana and half a scoop of protein powder.
* Dinner: Chicken breast (150g) OR pink salmon (170g), peas (30g), chickpeas (80g), kidney beans (80g), baby spinach (40g), 1/3 shredded carrot, mixed nuts (30g), salsa (40g), wholegrain mustard (15g) and olive oil (10ml).

1msfmcg,loseit,Bad Experience with a Registered Dietician,"My husband is working with a registered dietician through Berry Street, so I thought I would try the same. His RD is helpful and realistic with changes and suggestions.

The person I got? Absolutely disordered eating, despite claiming to make lifestyle changes.

She told me to first start seeing a DO over my HRT (my gyn put me on the HRT) and she went on to say most gyns just throw you on it and leave it at that. I guess I could benefit from that, but her further suggestions were so upsetting. I told her I work out by weight lifting in the morning, running or power walk after work, and light yoga at night to stretch. I do this about 4-5 times a week. I'm 5'6, 150 lbs, 42 years old. 

Her suggestions included: working out daily (so no rest days???), claiming I need to find indoor exercise for winter and it would do no good to only workout in the summer (even when I never brought that up and actually DO indoor exercise during winter anyway... I actually HAVE a fitness background but I didn't go into that with her). She gave me a 1200 calorie/day meal plan DESPITE me telling her I want to build muscle mass. Doesn't want me using protein powder. I looked at the recipes she sent and one included a snack of frozen grapes dusted with sugar free Kool Aid...WTF!! 

She asked me how many pounds I wanted to lose. I said well at my age I'd rather focus on healthy food choices and muscle mass. She was so committed to getting a number and suggested 135 lbs. I said but wouldn't that interfere with muscle mass? She also wanted me to get a scale that measures fat and muscle mass, and weigh myself every morning. Good God. I'm sure I could stand to lose a few pounds, but for my height/weight and goals, this seems extreme! She then told me to also measure myself with a tape measure and when I see my doctor, let them know about any inch loss and weight loss, because they love to hear that, and often don't hear enough about folks losing weight (??!). It just seems almond mom to the extreme. 

She was also telling me to drink seltzer water, pushing to stop my green smoothies and no more juice, pushing me to stop coffee (only one or two cups a day).  Yes, I know fruit is better than the juice, I only have a small glass of juice with my breakfast in the morning. My green smoothie helps me stay full (the Naked brand smoothie). The rest of the day I drink water. 

I'm so upset because it just seems too much, too fast. I'm not even a heavy weight, my BMI falls within the normal range. She told me if fruits or veggies fall within the ""dirty dozen"", buy organic or don't buy at all. I really can't afford organic on top of today's already expensive groceries. 

I just want to cry. I contacted Berry Street, because no way in hell will this work. 

Had anyone else experienced anything like this? It's not even that I want to stuff my face or anything, but logic tells me with my workouts and my goals, these suggestions will do nothing to help me, and so many of the things she was talking about just seemed like disordered eating.

I’m 46 and in good health (no aches and pains, get sick hardly at all), but I’m aware I’m probably in perimenopause (I didn’t notice any symptoms yet but I have an IUD so I don’t get periods anyway). And this could be a reason I’m tending to hang on to more cm around the waist line!

I have a sedentary job but I try to walk half an hour daily at least. I have quite a low body fat % naturally (I had it measured a couple of years ago and it was 20% then, which was good for my age/sex/lifestyle, and I didn’t gain any weight since then). I am self-employed and a single parent, so I have to work a lot (at my desk, sigh) and cannot afford a gym membership. 

For further context, I already cut added sugar (including in fruit) out of my diet altogether, along with refined carbs (I eat only wholemeal carbs) just under à year ago. I don’t have a sweet tooth at all and don’t even use sugar substitutes. I drink only water, coffee and tea. No sodas. My calories are always 1,200 or less each day, but 1,200 is ‘maintenance’ for me because I am short and quite small build. 

My child is with me on alternate weeks. She is 9, so can’t yet be left alone while I attend exercises out of the house. 

So … I will be reducing calories still further to try to stop those few cm size gain on waist from overtaking me in peri … without being too strict, I will lean more towards keto side (reducing carbs), but I think I need to add some cardio too, to get my general fitness up and burn more!

I am already tracking my calories through the my fitness app, tracking to loose 2 lbs per week, and trying to go to the gym 3 times a week for at least 40 min. Im also attempting to drink more water as well, though with the busy nature of my job I often struggle to remember to drink enough. I would say my job is moderately active. Im on my feet 8 hrs a day, walk aprox. 7k-15k steps a day, and do some physical lifting, no more than 40-50lbs.

My biggest hurdle right now is that I really enjoy drinking my calories. Red bulls, coffee with half and half(no sugar), Arizona tea, all are my favorites and all have calories. They really sneak up on you. Im doing my best to stick to sugar free red bulls when I have to have one, but coffee really is my sanity keeper. I would switch out for more sugar free options, but whatever they put in there to make things ""sugar free"" tastes like garbage to me.

I was wondering if there was anything else I could be doing to keep to my 2lbs a week goal or help me expedite my weightloss even more in a safe healthy manor.

1mnslud,loseit,New here. Trying to Lose weight,"Hello everyone! I am new to this sub. A bit about me I'm a 42M and I did weigh 260 at 5'10"". Needless to say I've got a belly, and for the majority of my life I've ate whatever I've wanted to. Recently I have decided to make that effort to start losing weight. 3 weeks ago I started walking at different trails in wooded parks. While weighing myself today I am down to 241.9 So pretty close to 9lbs down so far. For context mon to fri at my job I walk over 10,000 steps a day easy. However I've only really started to feel a difference while walking at the park. I haven't made it to 5 days in a row walking yet, that is my next goal. I do make an effort to walk Sat and Sun as those are my 2 biggest sedentary days. I started off walking in the park doing about 2 to 2.5 miles each time. Today I did 3.3 and added on top of what I walked at work I walked 24,959 steps according to my phone. (Which for some reason my watch says only 20k steps)  

I am now looking into getting into the calorie deficit. I could really use some good meal plan recipes for the week. In the morning at work I drink a bolthouse smoothie about 300ish calories, and a cup of coffee(calories unkown), lunch at work I can eat those lean cuisine power bowls, like 400ish calories, then I need a dinner. I think 1500 calories a day is what I'm aiming for? I don't know if that's right. I love chicken! 

I'm pretty committed to this change in life, and what to lose weight. My goal is 220 for now. I absolutely love walking, it's been a huge stress reliever for me, and puts me in a good mood.  So now that I've rambled on, I hope this all makes sense. I believe I am looking for some guidance. What am I doing wrong, what should I focus on. It's all pretty overwhelming to me trying to look a lot of different information up.  Any help is very much appreciated.

1mnqq5a,loseit,"Looking for advice on addressing lower stomach pooch and improving shape. Is the biggest contributing factor most likely posture, diet, or exercise?","Hi all, I'm seeking constructive feedback on reducing my lower stomach pooch. I'm 5'5"", 130lbs. My waist measurement (1/2"" above my bellybutton) is 30"", whereas the largest part of my stomach (2"" below my bellybutton) is \~35.5"".

Image links are attached, if that's helpful: [Image 1](https://imgur.com/Jc7gPrX) and [Image 2](https://imgur.com/a/jJiXie4)

This issue is my biggest insecurity, and it stares back at me whenever I look at the mirror or see pictures of myself. My family and many of my friends have commented on it for most of my life, so it's always been a pain point for me. 

I understand you can't spot reduce fat and that our bodies naturally want to cushion our organs, but this doesn't feel like it's a normal fat distribution to me (and based on the measurements above, I don't think this is body dysphoria, either). 

I was drinking too much alcohol in 2021 - 2022 (to the point of having a problem) and have decreased my intake drastically (recently it's only gone back up to a couple of drinks a week). Additionally, I'm plant-based and most of my diet is whole, unprocessed foods. Besides alcohol, I only drink black coffee and water. 

Since 2022, I've dropped from 150lbs and got much thinner/leaner everywhere -- except for my stomach. I hover around 125 - 130lbs and everyone in my life has remarked on how skinny I've gotten, but I desperately want to look healthy and toned. I don't want to continue feeling bad about this insecurity, but it's also been driving me crazy trying to isolate what could possibly be causing this issue (beyond genetics).

Is it a posture/core issue? Does my diet need to be tweaked (e.g., reducing alcohol further, upping protein intake)? Is it bloat that won't go away? Maybe my body still hasn't kicked all of the fat I gained from drinking so much all those years ago? Or is more likely a lack of muscle in my core (that my small butt is accentuating)? 

Besides addressing those questions... if you know of any exercises that might help improve the shape there/build muscle, I'd love to hear them.

I'll share my current measurements and additional diet/workout info in a comment if that's helpful. I'm looking for advice that's grounded in evidence or backed by experience, not just quick fixes.

1mmxrp3,loseit,Weight loss journey for my wedding!,"34(M) AUS: Back in April 21st, 2025, I wanted to start exercising because I'm getting married in OCT 2025 and wanted to lose weight for my wedding (and overall feel much better about myself).

I found a bicycle for 20 AUD in Facebook marketplace and thought why not? I had to spend a few more bucks to service it myself and get it working properly. Since then, I've been cycling every day.

I was about 96kg+ when I first started, and I was doing 5-10km of cycling a day. The first thing I did when I started cycling was **cut my meal portions in half**. Once I started getting used to the routine, I started portioning and making sure I was in a calorie deficit. 3 months and a few weeks later, I'm now sitting at 72.95kg.

I didn't buy myself a scale until June 15th because I was too afraid that I might not be losing any weight. Then I realised all my jeans were getting loose and I immediately wanted to get a scale and track my weight. My first weight recorded was 84.3kg on June 15th.

**My current exercise routine:**

* Every weekday: Cycle 13-15km
* Every weekend: Cycle 33 - 36km
* Every day:
   * 300 pushups in reps of 30
   * At least 250 crunches in reps of 50
   * At least 5 Side planks with 35 seconds minimum on each side
   * At least 150 double leg raises in reps of 30

**Protein & Snacks:**

* Coffee
* Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein
* Vital Strength Hydroxy Ripped
* Dry roasted nuts (unsalted)
* Mandarin, Apple, Peach, Banana
* Greek Yoghurt
* Peanut butter (Crunchy & extra protein)

**My daily routine is mostly:**

* Coffee in the morning (no milk - never liked it in my coffee)
* Try to cycle before 1:30pm
* Do my pushups
* Protein shake of ON Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein once done
* Do all the ab exercises
* Some fruits (Apple/Banana/Pear) and some nuts to snack on.
* Dinner between 6pm - 7:30pm
   * Mostly a mix of:
      * Extra lean beef mince or chicken or lamb
      * Diced pumpkin and/or diced sweet potato
      * 2 eggs
      * Spinach, kale, parsley
      * Broccolini or broccoli
      * Edamame beans, Chickpeas
      * Diced beetroot
      * Sliced jalapenos and/or sliced pickles
      * Crumbled feta cheese
* \[8:30 - 9:30pm\] A bowl of Greek yoghurt with some peanut butter and berries
   * Or, Greek yoghurt and 1 scoop of Vital Strength Hydroxy Ripped Protein Powder mixed together
* A few more ab exercises
* Try and avoid food after 11:30pm
* Repeat

Cycling this rustic bicycle has been so much fun! The path is usually flat with 3 steep uphill bridges, but the gust is hectic, so it adds a bit more effort. The weekend path is more demanding and is constant uphill vs downhill. But I always try to beat my personal best from the previous day. So when things get easy, I start using only the higher gears to make it more demanding, and if that gets easy, I just floor it every now and then like a HIIT session.

I've also just recently started on my protein powder and I've been experimenting with making protein powder & rolled oats slices and other things, which are fun! Not to mention, my OCD luuuves having a schedule to stick to!

The biggest thing for me is that I feel great (even if I lose a bit of weight too frequently compared to what others might call ""healthy""). I used to have such bad heartburn after dinner back in the day and that has all gone away since I watch my calories/meals. Then there was the constant issue of being out of breath!

Me & my fiancée still enjoy some nights out together every now and then (there is an all-you-can-eat Japanese spot).

My average calorie consumption is somewhere between 1,300 - 1,700 and has been for years. I've never been able to consistently hit 2,000 calories a day with healthy foods. I try to walk 7,000 - 12,000 steps at work and probably another 2,000 steps while doing non work related stuff. I'm sleeping an average of 6 - 7 hours a day on work nights due to my commute. When I do workout I walk and lift weights instead of run / jog  due to workout induced asthma. I workout for 25 - 30 minutes sessions twice a week due to my work schedule. 

Even with meal prepping healthier foods, cutting sugary drinks, coffee, eating less takeout and forcing myself to walk more, going to the gym more consistently along with my already low calorie intake I've gained another solid 5-6 lbs of body fat in the past 3 months.

I wasn't very big to start with, but I was skinny fat and had tons of fat on my belly. I had one of those body tests at a gym and turns out my BMI is higher than others in are around my weight/age.

When I gain weight, I only gain on my upper belly, especially the belly. So I looked very disproportionate. l've lost 12lbs so far, but there's still fat and loose skin on my belly.
I'm so close to my ideal weight based solely on calorie deficit. 

But lately l've been eating a lot more, including burgers and fries, cookies and ice cream. And when I eat them, I can’t stop, and I ends up binging. I wouldn’t eat anything the next day, just tea, black coffee, and sometimes sugar free energy drinks. 

And my weight loss stopped.
It seems like my self control is disappearing and I'm thinking about food 24/7. I hate the loose skin and fat on my 
belly, but don't know what to do.

1mhcqmv,loseit,Losing weight as a smoker with asthma,"I’m 19. 306lbs. When my weight hit that number I froze. I used to be 129, then 180, then 260. Then suddenly I was 300lbs. I’ve been vaping since I was 14. I quit 2 weeks ago because my boyfriend asked me too and because the timeline just worked.(I moved away from my smoker family and cut off my mom). So I wasn’t near anyone vaping. Well I have asthma. I blame myself and my mom and sister were the ones buying me them. My sister didn’t until I was older. Well, I for 40+ hours, graduated at 16, associates at 19, and now getting my bachelors in science-nursing. So I thought to myself, I’ve tried to lose weight in the past, how hypocritical am I to be a nurse and not be healthy? So I am throwing the vape down for good. But my issue is, since moving away I’ve lost baggage but also gained grief. I’m tired of being overweight. I’m not a lazy person, I work 12-8 AM, my partner and I split mostly 50/50 and try to Atleast. We have I dog who’s very spoiled. The issue is my bf is heavy too. Nothing wrong with that, he’s 6’5 and 300 and it looks scrumptious on him. It’s another problem we have is overeating, not healthy food, and stuff alike. My biggest issue is I’d eat then starve when I was the ages of 14-17. My bf got me out of that. I have IBS, GERD, Asthma, MDD and anxiety. And I wanna let it go. I want to be on a diet that handles my GERD. And IBS. My anxiety is managed atm and so is my MDD. I’ve grown quite a lot. So my next question is working out with Asthma. What would you guys reccomend. Every time I ask my bf about different lifestyle choices we both try and fail or he just doesn’t want too. We can’t afford to be buying multiple different foods. I’m thinking about going gluten free unfortunately. I’m dairy free other than cream for coffee 2 times a week( couldn’t give it up, not bc I’m big back but because it genuinely one of my favorite hobbies) and Greek yogurt( it’s a obsession ofc) how do I go about this? But the step to quitting is my achievement for now!

Question 1. Asking my bf to try a diet or support me?

Question 2. What diets have worked for people with IBS

Question 3. Does meditation work for you?

I CANT AFFORD THERAPY! I’m used to being forced into therapy where my mom would tell them I was lying. It’s been really hard for me to even take that step but I’ve been growing and realized that I’m pagan, and I’ve been in such a great headspace since cutting my mom off.",2025-08-04 12:58:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mhcqmv/losing_weight_as_a_smoker_with_asthma/

1mguu0g,loseit,Just got my new scale and weighed myself,"I (28 FtM) weigh even more than I thought. I didn’t have access to a scale for awhile but estimated my weight to be around 250. I am 271 pounds at 5’9”. I’ve gained over 90 pounds in the last 5 years, much of it in the last year or so. I’ve struggled with my weight for most of my life but this is by far the heaviest I’ve ever been.

I’m mostly disappointed in myself for not maintaining the few healthy habits I had managed to develop. I used to do a lot of walking and I ate a relatively clean diet, plus I did body weight exercises most days, and I was even starting to go to my university’s gym a few times a week. But I struggled with my mental health when the pandemic hit and I just haven’t built those healthy habits back into my lifestyle since recovering. Now realizing I have to lose at least 100 lbs I just feel like I’m at the base of a mountain that I have to climb.

I’ve made a couple changes the past couple days that I think I can maintain. I downloaded a fitness tracker app that I’m logging my meals on. I cut out sugary drinks, I’m a barista so I was drinking a lot of very sugary coffees. I want to get back into walking and hiking and kayaking, most exercise is a chore to me except activities that get me outside.  I also really want to get some exercise equipment and develop a workout routine at home. My problem is getting started tbh. I struggle to start things and maintain motivation when I don’t see immediate results, and I know that when done right weight loss is a long journey.

Not totally sure why I’m posting this. I guess I figured this sub might have some helpful tips with starting an exercise plan or maintaining motivation over the long term when you’re looking to lose 100+ pounds. This all feels super daunting and honestly I’m just trying to remind myself that it is actually possible. I want to feel better than I do right now, I want 
to get fit/healthy.

1mg2v31,loseit,Looking for support - day 22 of my new life,"I am 29F and I gained 25kg in 5 years, from 64 to 89kg, since COVID. Now I want to get back to 64. It has been 3 weeks, and I've lost 3kg (which is mostly water, I know), and I am looking for a support community to help me in my journey. Feel free to leave your story, or any comments/feedback/support message really. 

P.S. Sorry for the longer post and inconsistent thoughts. Also, English is not my native. 

So here it is. 

I tried and failed so many times, but now I finally do not want to just lose the weight - I want to have a healthier life and develop some healthy habits. It's cliché, I know, but it really is just that. I want to lose weight and, in the process, develop habits I can keep for the rest of my life. That's why I've decided not to give up on anything that I cannot imagine my life without, e.g., if I know I cannot go for the rest of my life without any chocolate, then I will not forbid myself chocolate now. I just want to be in control again. And I think that was the reason I was failing in the past. So I've finally started something that I think might work. 

I've written down my biggest problems:

* Not being consistent. 
* Eating large portions and an inability to stop when I am full.
* Impulsive eating, even when I am not hungry.
* Not being able to resist when people around me eat.
* ""Ok, I've eaten this, let's eat everything then, the day went to hell anyway"" mindset.
* Snacks and junk food.
* Social drinking, even when I am not feeling like it.
* Almost no physical activity.

What I’ve started:

* Fasting 16:8.
* Food logging.
* Walking.

Fasting and food logging help me keep my portions reasonable. At the beginning, I was forcing and struggling not to get a second plate (repete in Serbian) for lunch, to resist when the others were eating. Now I am more prepared, and I finally feel like I am in control. E.g., if I know there will be pancakes in the office, I will eat salad for lunch, and take one pancake and not 5. Or if I am hanging out with friends, I will snack on grapes, and not chips. I do not drink alcohol just because it's a celebration, and fasting helps me with avoiding junk food, late snacking, and impulsive eating. 

Fasting is also hard sometimes, but it kinda works for me because we are having luch at noon every day in the office, and I usually skip breakfast anyway, so fasting fitted in well (although giving up my morning coffee is the hardest part rn).

I also started walking because I felt like a walrus while rotting in the apartment/office throughout a day and I was sad for not being able to share my husband's hobby with him (hiking and mountineering). 

**But the most important thing** is that I do not do it perfectly every day. Sometimes I eat more then my calory goal, sometimes I fast only 14 or even 12 hours. I have a cheat day. I do not go for a walk every day and I do not have steps goal yet because even going outside is currently big deal for me.

I log into a food journal every day, and share my progress, some affirmations, and gratitudes toward myself. It might sound silly but i chat with Chat GPT about my progress a lot, and it really helps. This, along with walking and fasting, helps me being more consistent and building a habit for once in my life. 

And honestly, although some days are still hard, especially when I feel like I am not in control, mostly I really feel awesome. I already see that, e.g., right now, I am not obsessing over food or the fact that I started with fasting. I also stopped (in 75% cases) obsessing and constantly thinking about my next meal and how to fit in the food in my calorie goal. Instead, I eat what I want (as long as it is not junk, although sometimes I include kebab or popcorn or stuff like that) and generally try making healthier choices. I am still trying to fully convince myself that being reasonable and eating mindfully, and what I’ve decided to eat, is more important than the number of calories. I learned that it is important not to punish myself when I ""make a mistake"", because that really backfires into ""ok I'll eat pizza now, and then fast for 24h"", and then hate the whole world. But also, if I eat pizza, I do not let go of a whole day, I just try to go back to the routine like nothing happened. However, I  still struggle often with being harsh to myself after mistakes like these.

Of course, I still fear that it might all backfire, I do not have a confidence yet to say it will 100% work, but I am hopefull.

\---

Some backstory, if anyone is interested.

Before, I was going to the dancing classed my whole life, and I always eated a lot, but I guess dancing and walking around more, stopped the weight. Then came the lockdown and I started my first job that was very stresfull, and everything went to hell.

When I first reached 70kg and then 75kg I felt devastated. Although now I would be happy with that weight. I always liked dressing nicely, and I felt so ugly at the beginning that I totally lost any will for fashion, or taking care of how I look. I was bying dull and plain clothes, too much oversized.

It wasn't until two years ago that I finally accepted my new weight and started buying clothes according to my style again, buying accessories, dressing up for work, and makeup, etc. I somehow lost that ""there's no point in dressing up when you're fat and ugly anyway"" attitude. And I am still not sure what happened exactly, but I am so grateful that it did, and I often feel beautiful now, even with my imperfect body. Although I still do not feel beautiful when I am naked. 

During the past 5 years, I've lost count of how many times I was starting with a diet or exercise. When I got engaged 2 years ago, I even took a personal trainer, but nothing worked; I hated her, the gym, and the diets. I hated every advice my fiancé (now husband) would give me, and all the clothes I could not buy anymore. I felt so ashamed of myself for constantly failing, and I felt ashamed even for mentioning that I started again.

Thursday at 9am (73 hours into fast) I consumed 6 eggs and 4 strips of bacon. This actually led to another 36 hour fast which wasn’t intentional I simply wasn’t hungry.

1mf1n6w,loseit,My mom is weirdly competitive with her weight loss,"Hey y‘all,

Maybe this is a weird thing to ask, but I‘m hoping that a weightloss sub is the most fitting place. 

My mom and me are both currently losing weight. I have a small history of disordered eating, but I have done a lot of therapy and am finally at a point where I can lose weight (currently overweight) without destroying my body in the process. My mom is losing weight too, and she asked me for help with figuring out how to calorie count correctly. I do want to support her since she’s also overweight and getting older, I want her to live a long healthy life. I showed her an app she can use and what a healthy amount would be for her height etc etc. I heavily stressed that eating too little is also harmful.

The problem now is: she keeps sending me screenshots of her daily calorie overview - and they’re all significantly below what he recommended her. I‘m receiving pictures of ""580 calories"", ""800 calories"", ""950 calories"" and at the same time ""today I also walked 10.000 steps and did ___ exercise""
I have now told her repeatedly that those amounts are way too low and very unhealthy, especially since she’s an active person. She doesn’t get it. I told her today that an apple and a black coffee for lunch isn’t a very balanced meal and that she needs nutrients to keep her body alive, and she only said ""but I felt SO FULL after that meal!""

I even think she might do it on purpose now, to show how ""well“ she’s dieting and maybe to prove to me that she is losing weight faster or better than me. 
It’s putting me into a spiral of bad thoughts I really wanted to leave in the past. I deeply regret helping her with everything, and already told her that I feel bad about myself when she sends me those pictures. But she doesn’t stop. 

I don’t really know what to do now. Obviously it’s kind of my fault for even ""starting"" the whole thing, but I truly had good intentions.
How can I help her lose weight in a healthy way? I don’t think she is intentionally trying to hurt me, and I also don’t want her to hurt herself.

Any help would be appreciated.

1mefxrl,loseit,Looking for advice for my sister,"I've been here a few years ago and lost some weight with CICO, so I know it works. But as it is, I can't really translate my own experience into helpful tips beyond ""just keep logging everything"" for my sister.

She's mentioned a few things that kind of act as a hurdle for her.

- She can't have coffee, which I use a lot to bridge the time between meals.

- She's really nervous about having to use the toilet on her way to work (with being stuck in traffic and all), so she can't have anything liquid-y like yoghurt or muesli then. She also drinks nothing before work because of that. Anything more elaborate than bread is too much for her for breakfast.

And then, being at work, it's hard for her to say no to office snacks when everyone else digs in. When they drink coffee, she gets a hot chocolate from the vending machine, which adds up.

- Another thing is that when she chooses a balanced meal, she has the feeling of it tasting ""too healthy"", so she often eats candy right after that. I've asked her if it's because vegetables taste too bland for her or if she doesn't use spices that much and she wasn't sure.

- She gets cravings at about 3PM a lot of the time.

- She'd rather have a large lunch to feel full for the rest of the day and skip breakfast / have a light dinner.

- She has trouble with deciding on what's healthy. She's confused by different health apps / meal plans from doctors that her relatives follow and what they categorize as ""green light food"". I've got the feeling that she's more concerned with hitting her macros at that point and ends up overeating as a result.

- She recently got a multicooker, if that helps.

- She's been going to the gym for a few months now and is sad that her weight stays the same, which still points to it being the issue of eating too much.

She's tried IF, but didn't stick to it.
Would volume eating be something worth to consider? I don't know. The main thing is that logging calories is too much for her and she's been trying for so long.

1mdlac7,loseit,The day after a 6000 calorie binge. Spoiler: everything is fine.,"Yesterday was a friend's housewarming party. Between the pizzas, the beers that kept flowing, the charcuterie boards and the homemade tiramisu, it was a real party. Out of curiosity, I did a quick calculation in the evening: around 6000 calories. It's the kind of number that can make you panic.

But stop, we breathe. It's really not the end of the world and above all, it doesn't mean you're going to gain kilos all at once.

We can put it into perspective with some very simple math

This 6000 calorie number is impressive, but it's a raw figure. You have to remember to subtract everything your body would have naturally burned in a day. That's your total energy expenditure. It includes your basal metabolic rate just to function, the energy used for your activities like walking or working, and even the energy to digest that big meal.

**So let’s do a quick and simple calculation.**

Let’s say you’ve used a classic [TDEE calculator](https://lean-app.com/tdee-calculator/) and figured out that your body burns around 2200 calories for a typical day. Your 6000 calorie excess is actually a surplus of about 3800 calories

Now, you need to know that one kilo of fat represents about 7700 calories. With a surplus of 3800 calories, the actual fat gain is therefore 490 grams.

Yes, you read that right. A little less than 500 grams. Not 5 kilos. It's the weight of a small water bottle. That's immediately a lot less scary, right? It's just a small pebble on your path, not a mountain.

And now what do we do

The worst thing would be to want to punish yourself. Starving yourself the 3 next days or exercising excessively are the worst ideas. It's the best way to get disgusted with it and give it all up. 

Real strength is to resume your habits as if nothing happened. Today, I got up, a little bloated, which is logical. I drank a large glass of water, had my coffee and ate a normal breakfast. The key is to simply return to the routine gently. Remember to hydrate well to help your body eliminate. Eat balanced meals with vegetables and protein. And if you move, do it for the pleasure, like a good walk to clear your mind, not to ""compensate"" excessively for the day before.

This single day slip-up gets lost in the totality of the efforts you made before and will make after. A single day absolutely does not define your journey. The most important thing is not to never fall, it's to know how to get back up and continue on the road.

So if it happens to you, be kind to yourself. You enjoyed it, and now a new day begins. We keep going.",2025-07-30 22:59:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mdlac7/the_day_after_a_6000_calorie_binge_spoiler/

I've tried taking it out and it comes back and it's a feeling I can't stand so I always go back to drinking them. I thought maybe it was an electrolyte  issue at one point but I don't think that's it.

1mcd7cu,loseit,Scale won’t budge,"I’m 6’, 190lbs (as of this morning). I’ve got my calories/day down to between 1700-1800, never more than that. I weight everything I eat, even the butter on my toast which is so little it barely register on the scale. We even stopped cooking vegetables with oil altogether. I’m hungry almost constantly, not starving but definitely feeling like I could eat more. Please don’t say “you must have hidden calories somewhere” because I definitely don’t. My husband is so annoyed that I have to measure everything I eat/drink, even the splash of almond milk in my coffee which is all of 5 calories.

I wasn’t seeing any movement on the scale at all after a couple of weeks of changing my diet, so I decided to get serious in the gym. Right now I’m walking 3miles with a 15lb weighted vest at between 3.7-4.0 speed 5 days/week. Getting so sweaty and my HR is always somewhere around 144 for the full 44 minute walk. It feels good. 

Been doing this combo for 3.5 weeks straight and I only weigh myself on Monday mornings before breakfast. But the scale isn’t budging at all. If my TDEE is correct, I should be in a 400 calorie deficit on diet alone. And then the walking is certainly burning at least 100 calories per walk, probably more. So what gives? Is this going to hit suddenly one week or do I need to make a doctor’s appointment? I’m so frustrated.

1mbp17t,loseit,It’s been 9 years,"About 9 years ago I made this Reddit account just for the purpose of joining this subreddit. I followed all the advice, stuck it out and managed to drop 50+ pounds by diet, exercise, and more tears than I’d be willing to admit to someone IRL. Life changed, I graduated, got a job, changed that job, gained maybe 10-ish back but thought I’d ultimately got a handle on things.

Then Covid hit…

I’ve been debating on whether to post here again because from 2020-2024 I backslid and then surpassed my highest weight by a good 40 pounds, peaking at 276 after new years this year (and also I’ve always been a lurker at heart lol). Honestly, it was incredibly embarrassing to think about. But today? Despite being still way higher than I was 9 years ago, I can also proudly say I hit 15 pounds lost from the beginning of the year. I can’t fit into my old clothes yet, but the clothes I’ve been wearing suddenly feel noticeably looser. The progress so far isn’t just a fluke or some incredibly large water weight shift.

There’s not exactly a big point to this post. It’s some cross between a celebration and encouragement for others in the same position of having to start from scratch or worse. You might find some of the same tricks will work for you that did the first time, and you might find that you’ve got to give some new strategies a shot. It’s been a combination of the two for me (ie: I stopped putting sugar in coffee the first time around, never needed to ‘train’ myself out of that a second time). But I hope this gives someone who was feeling as hopeless as I was in the last year or so the encouragement to give it a shot again.",2025-07-28 18:59:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mbp17t/its_been_9_years/

1mb6fyx,loseit,I just realized how bad my food choices can be sometimes.,"I was on myfitnesspal tonight, trying to plan out my food for tomorrow, since I ate too much today, and I’ve got no choice but to go to a place I tend to overeat tomorrow too. Therefore, I want to have a plan of what I’m eating, to avoid the temptations.

So far, across a planned breakfast and dinner, I’ve logged in 4 items, and only 558 calories, and it’s already at 2,500 mg of sodium.

I don’t super know what to do, because were on vacation so I don’t exactly have a fully stocked fridge, I’m eating what’s made.

Those four items are

\- A few fried egg whites

\- 2 sausage links

\- A salad (olive garden)

\- Chicken and gnocchi soup (also olive garden, and most of the sodium)

  
I know olive garden isn’t the healthiest place on earth, but I have to go, I have no choice. I wouldn’t be as concerned if I hadn’t overeaten today, and didn’t know that someone would be cooking spaghetti in a few days.

I’ve been thinking about switching out the sausage links for a chobani yogurt I bought while I was here, that gets me some more calories and some protein, but gets me down to about 2,100 mg of sodium. Still, only halfway to just 1,000 calories. The only fruit I have on hand is cherries, and I’m probably going to get some coffee, but the only calories there are from sugar.

  
Aside from the cherries, I’ve got cheese cubes, salami bites, turkey bites, and more yogurt. 

What else can I eat without increasing the sodium, (or the fat, ’cause I got too much of that yesterday too)?

 Also, does anyone have any suggestions for olive garden that are a bit healthier? All I’ve ever gotten is that or the kids chicken alfredo, which I can’t order in the restuarant.",2025-07-28 04:06:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mb6fyx/i_just_realized_how_bad_my_food_choices_can_be/

But today, I signed up for the gym. I’ve got **40 days** before I propose to the love of my life, and I want to be able to **kneel with confidence**, without pain or embarrassment. I’m aiming big, like 1 kilo (2.2 lbs) per day, although I know that might not be realistic or healthy.  
A friend suggested trying **Muslim-style intermittent fasting** (no food or water from sunrise to sunset), followed by one coffee and three small meals after sunset. A gym session is recommended after breaking the fast, and one solid meal is suggested post-gym, essentially keeping the stomach empty for most of the day.

I’m willing to push myself hard. But I don’t want to crash, burn out, or damage my body in the process. So my question is, what’s the best and most effective approach to lose as much weight as possible in these 40 days?  
Should I do this dry fast thing? Switch to clean eating and train hard? Do OMAD (something like eating one meal a day in a short period) combined with Islamic fasting thing? I’m doing everything I can, but I need real guidance. If you’re willing to help, I’ll post daily updates here progress, diet, gym, weight.

Hey everyone, 20M 6’3, ~200lbs here. I’d say my bf% is ~26%, just an estimation though, never got tested. I go to the gym at least 5 days a week with regular cardio (30min 15 incline treadmill at 3mph). I wanna get down to like ~20 bf%, which means about ~165-170lb I’m guessing for my height. I’m eating around ~2200 calories daily: 

Cal, protein: 

Breakfast : 3 eggs (fried) - 300cal, 18g
Lunch: 
1 cup uncooked basmati rice - 3 cooked cups - 600 cal, 12g
Chicken breast- ~200g - 330cal, 62g
Vegetables (steamed) - 50cal, 2g protein

Pre-gym: 
Coffee-protein snack (self-made) - ~120cal, 8g

Dinner: 
Protein shake (1.5 scoops) : 180cal, 37.5g
Greek yogurt (1 cup) : 100 cal, 3g
Fruits: 50 cal, 2g

Any misc. oils etc: 400cal

Total: ~2200cal, protein ~145g


Tldr: 20M, 6’4, ~200lb with ~27% bf eating around 2200cal daily, is this enough or am I at a risk of losing muscle? 

I want to lose fat quickly, and I know that extreme dieting isn’t the safest route—but I feel like this plan is working for me slightly. The 400 “misc” calories are just a buffer for things like oil or random bites. I use spray oil, so there’s no way it’s actually 400—but I add it just to stay on the safe side. I tend to overeat pretty easily, so I want to set a stricter limit for myself to stay in control. That said, I usually end up binge eating during one or two cheat days each week.

Ik this is long, I’m sorry, any advice is appreciated.

Am I measuring wrong? I don't use much oil, and weigh everything with a scale and put it into my fitness pal. I do drink a lot of black coffee and tea. I ate pretty healthy before, mostly whole foods, but really never got that high up there in protein. I also am training for a half marathon in November, so I'll get cardio in anywhere from 5-7 hours a week between running and cycling. You'd think that'd make me ravenous.

Do ya'll think it's ok to eat 1500 if I'm feeling fine? InBody and Evolt said that's my BMR, and I do not want to start losing hair or my period (it happened with my initial weight loss 3 years ago from 230-155).

To summarize my background: I'm 26, ftm, have been medically transitioning for 6+ years, had an ED in my teens and ever since have been really big on keeping healthy eating + exercise habits, and around year 2/3 of (testosterone) hrt my metabolism seemed to have naturally sped up so I became underweight for the next 3 or so years without really trying or restricting past just generally eating healthy, not overeating, and moving everyday. (I was tracking my macros+calories the whole time, and I have to preface by saying: i do not eat out, pretty much ever. If it happens once a month that's already way out of my routine. I eat at home, homecook all my meals, and weigh all my ingredients. I track every single thing I ingest, so no ""oh maybe you're snacking in between meals and not counting those calories"" - if it goes in my mouth, it goes on my food scale, then in my daily log. So it is with 100% certainty that I say for the better part of these past 5 or so years I have kept a daily intake of around 1200 calories, with some reasonable variation (1400/1500\~ occasionally, up to 1800 once or twice a year on holidays, 800/900\~ ish on really bad days. Yes I know that's not good, but sometimes depression/life events get to you. I'm 165cm/5""4 tall, so yes, I do have a lower intake need generally because of how short I am.)   
Sometime around last year, for some inexplicable reason I seemed to start ballooning up - at first it was a slow creep, but then last summer shit really hit the fan, as I gained around 5kg (10lbs roughly) in one single month. It has been an uphill battle ever since to shed those, with some limited success, as well as trying to look into underlying medical causes. (and yes, I know, 5kg/10lbs might sound like nothing. But again, I'm very short, so it's *extremely* noticeable, and it is the tipping point between me feeling confident in my body, and feeling like a disgusting blob of flesh.)

I have checked my thyroid, and it is actually bordering on hyperthyroidism (which my mom has, so there's gotta be a genetic component there). I had an issue of hyperprolactinemia (likely jumpstarted by stimulation to my nipples from having a masculinizing mastectomy where they preserved my natural nipples, and then just kept going in a feedback loop by stress. Notable event is that same summer I had dealt with probably one of the most stressful situations of my life, that had me pretty much in a constant fight or flight for the better part of june/july.), and I was prescribed cabergoline to stop it... it seemed like it stopped the constant upward climb on the scale, but it didn't help much in shedding the gained weight.  
Now I'm looking at my insulin and glucose level and seeing if I might have some insuline resistance issue. I've been prescribed berberine supplements by my endocrinologist to see if that helps while I investigate this issue, but so far it seems to not have had any effect.   
I have discovered I have IBS-C, which, when triggered, causes me to become extremely bloated and retain a fuckton of fluids - and I know I for sure rack up water weight when I'm having a bad spell, because I've gone entire weeks without a single BM, and then lost up to 2kg/4lbs in one go when I finally managed to unclog myself (It seemed insane to me too, but it's happened multiple times).

Now - while desperately trying to decrease my intake and up my exercise, I've started strength training on top of all the various medication changes since last year. More or less, it seemed to be doing *something* \- over the course of the year between last summer and now, I had managed to lose 3kg (5lbs) of the gained weight - and honestly, I felt a lot better than even before, because while I still recognized that some areas had stubborn fat that I just could not stand having on my body, due to the exercise I had gained a lot more muscle, and had a lot more visible muscle definition. I recognize there are some ghosts of my ED that will never truly leave, and that I was looking at my body pre-weight gain with rose tinted glasses, because in my head skinnier=better. In truth, I was emaciated, weak, and while I did love finally not having any fat at all in my hips or thighs for the first time in my life, I do think my overall shape had become a lot more masculine since the muscle mass made me a lot more top heavy. Things felt like they were on the road to getting better.

  
And then... things seem to have come crashing down, again, as summer rolls around. Again - I have not changed a *single* thing about my daily routine. I eat around 1200 calories a day. I make sure to hit my protein and fiber goals. I strength train 40/50 minutes a day, for 5 days a week, on top of walking 10k steps every day. I don't consume liquid calories - the only liquids I drink are water, black coffee, and extremely occasionally a diet soda or zero sugar energy drink.   
And yet... I've gained back all the weight I lost, my muscle definition has seemingly evaporated, and I look like a bloated, pudgy mess. I had a brief IBS-C flare up earlier in the month, but I've managed to deal with it - I hoped it was another spell of water weight that would go away as soon as I managed to have a BM, but nope. The scale keeps going up. 

I have no idea what it is about summer that does this to my body, if it is the heat (where i live it can get up to 40C/104F) and water retention, or maybe somehow substituting more fresh/raw fruits and vegetables instead of cooked greens (the only discernible change in my diet, since it's too hot to turn the stove/oven on for every meal) somehow has a negative effect on my body. But it feels like I'm going to have to spend another year to undo the damage, and I'm so tired. I don't know what's wrong with me anymore. By all metrics, I should be losing weight. My doctors and endocrinologists are puzzled as fuck, because everything about my bloodwork suggests I should be having a hard time gaining weight, if anything, and struggling with unintentional weight *loss*, not gain.   
All the TDEE estimates I've done say my maintenance should be around 1800.   
The only area where I think I could possibly improve personally is that I struggle to get enough sleep (my average is around 6 hours a night, 7 on a good day and 5 on a bad one, sometimes I manage 8 but I'm just too busy in a day to be in bed by the time I should be/stay in bed as long as I should), but could that alone really be doing *that* much damage?

I don't know what I'm sending this post out for, truthfully. Last time I posted I got no traction. I doubt I will get any traction this time, either. But I just cannot deal with the blobfish I see in the mirror everyday. I was so happy with myself, I had discovered two different versions of my ideal self, and I've lost them both. I cannot deal with this, even if it's a temporary thing that happens every summer. I've always had a little bit of weight gain in summer that then went away within the first month of fall, but it's never been this bad - and if this year is gonna be anything like last year, it'll take me 6+ months to bounce back, if I bounce back at all. I just want to be happy with who I see in the mirror again. I want to feel like my body's mechanisms make logical, scientific *sense* and I can work with them to my advantage. I no longer understand or know the beast I'm working with. Please, if there's anyone here on reddit that has any advice - maybe there's something I'm doing wrong, still. Maybe I'm missing something crucial. Maybe there's an extremely obscure condition that I had no idea existed that someone can illuminate me about. Please - anybody who has five cents to give, help.",2025-07-23 21:18:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m7lk10/still_struggling_with_weight_a_year_later_still/
1m785zu,loseit,Extremely low energy all of a sudden,"5'3, 35 female, current weight 63.6kgs, starting weight 65kgs. Current daily calories: 1500. 

Since Monday, my energy levels are in the toilet. I'm sleeping my usual amount I think, and work and personal life are normal. But my motivation is low, I can't pull myself off the couch and I have no desire to go to the gym. Since June, my average daily steps have gone from 3k to 10k. This week is it absolutely back to 3k a day if not less. I'm close to just going to bed in the middle of the afternoon. I do take antidepressants but everything is all good and I've been on them for years. No menstrual cycle (long story but all healthy and fine)

My workout routine is treadmill at least three times a week at 12% incline. On Monday, I started doing weights: chest press, shoulder press, lat raise, leg press. But I'm not good at it and so the weights are low. Approximate protein intake 90grams. My diet is eggs, tuna, vegetables, chicken and rice and pasta. Some beef, some beans. Little to no junk food except a bag of popped crisps occasionally. My only vice is beer. I have one or two low alcohol, low calorie beers a night. I don't drink coffee but I drink about two cups of black tea a day.

Is it possible that anything to do with my diet/routine is causing this sudden exhaustion or might it be completely unrelated? ",2025-07-23 12:40:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m785zu/extremely_low_energy_all_of_a_sudden/

I stick to my diet pretty well, always under my points but recently I've felt horrible, run down and tired. I eat mostly veggies with a good amount of protein, not much fat though. Im not sure if it is an electrolyte imbalance or muscle loss, but my leg muscles ache and I have not been to a gym. I recently was in a state of SVT with a heart rate of 210 and I have never had heart issues before, so this was a shock, maybe too much coffee. My blood work at the ER was normal but electrolytes on the lower end. I couldn't focus at work today and messed up an experiment that I never would have if my head was right.

1m5sngy,loseit,Starting my weight loss and confidence boosting journey. What's your story?,"Hello, everyone. A lot has been going through my mind about self-confidence, weight loss, appearance, and mental health. Because of that, I wanted to write this post talking about what I am doing and will be doing and I would really appreciate any feedback, tips and tricks, and your personal experiences as well.

I am a **23** year old man, **5 foot 7 inches in height**, and **230 lbs in weight**. Not at all happy with the way I look. I used to skinny as a child and my weight always fluctuated but in the past few years, I have not gone below 210 lbs. I'm at a point in life where the self realizations have hit that I need to get it together. I struggle a lot with self-confidence issues and am always hyper-focused on how I appear. The classic shirt tugging, then keep checking the pictures you click to see if your chest doesn't appear to be big. Nothing wrong with that of course but it brings me down a lot. I'm in my summer break right now and it has taught me a lot in many areas in my life.

My **goal** is to reach **190 lbs**. After that, whether I want to continue or start body building, can't think about unless I achieve what I really want now.

I've made some **small changes** which I would like to share. For the past 6 days, I've been going to the gym. First 4 days, all I did was 15 minutes of treadmill, 3 miles per hour and 12 incline. I would feel like fainting after just those 15 minutes. Then, Saturday, I went to walk in the morning on this trail. Its located literally right next to where I live so it was easy to push myself to go. I walked around 4.2 miles in total. Not sure how many steps that was, I should have been using an app or something. Then, last night, I went to the gym and was able to be on the treadmill for 30 minutes. Granted, I raised the incline slowly this time but I was able to burn more calories so it felt really good. Legs felt horrible around the 15 minute mark but then I didn't feel any discomfort after that. I was kind of surprised. Not sure what that was. Also, I read another post about walking 20k steps per day. I might have the ability to do that some times a week so I actually might create like a 100k steps per week goal. What do you guys think of that?

**Entertainment** wise, I've been listening to songs and podcasts during my gym/walk time. I really want to get into interesting history or politics so if anybody has any recommendations, let me know!

**Food** wise, I've been roughly measuring my calorie intake. Right now, I average about 1800 calories per day. my BMR is 2000 calories per day. Do you guys think that is good enough? I'm a vegetarian (+eggs). I'm Indian so I cook Indian food at home. Mornings are either cereal or coffee with some Belvita cookies. Snacks might include low sodium chips or protein bars. Dinner and lunch is something Indian. If I order from outside, it might be the chipotle veggie bowl or the veggie wrap from chick-fil-a.

**Appearance** wise, I've observed a few things this past year and got some suggestions. One is to have either slightly unkempt hair but very well maintained beard or the opposite. I like to not touch my beard and let it be the way it is so I want to focus on my hair. Ordered a pomade to get it to look the way I want it to. Not sure though. Also, I used to hate the idea of accessorizing yourself with rings, necklaces, etc. But, as I've gotten older, my mind has sort of shifted. I'm getting more in tune with my family's religion (Sikh) as well and my mom has actually told me ways I could do that. Three things I'm doing is, a ring, a sikh necklace, and a sikh kara (bracelet). I have one and the others, I'll be getting soon.

All of this thinking has actually made me a bit more productive in work as well. I would love to hear everyone's stories so I can learn more and if you guys have been feedback or tips, please do share. Peace and love.",2025-07-21 19:36:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m5sngy/starting_my_weight_loss_and_confidence_boosting/
1m5q6uy,loseit,Recently Lost Gluten & Lost Dairy & Now Losing Weight Faster….Honest!,"I’ve recently cut out gluten, eggs, rice, dairy and I’ve lost almost 2 pounds yesterday & another 2 pounds the day before. What fresh magic is this? I’m 45F 5’9” and 3 days ago I frustrated that I had gained back to 170 & I whipped that number back into shape real quick still maintaining 1985 calories a day! (I’m haven’t been exercising other than playing with my kids ) What’s is happening? I’m with lemon water then juicing 8 ounces of celery juice and then a little later I’ll have a cup of coffee with oat milk & honey, then I’ll do another juice like apple carrot ginger, orange or something then I was eating baked potatoes with grilled chicken with melted vegan cheese & spices & roasted veggies, then a cold pressed melon cucumber juice or something a little later in the afternoon, herbal teas  a slice or two of vegan roasted vegetable pizza. Steamed broccoli & cauliflower with potatoes & spices raw garlic every day one clove. I am shocked that Friday I was 170. Then Sunday 167 and now Monday 165. I’m not going hungry! Feeling satisfied. Logging & measuring everything. Just Staying under 2000 calories. Nothing major! Cutting a lot of things out, but I’m pleased The needle is actually moving this fast all of a sudden w/ this gluten-free dairy free experiment! I’ve been doing the juicing in the mornings for awhile now and calories are same just swapped pasta and bread rice for potatoes and roasted vegetables. I swear it’s making a difference. I know there’s a point of diminishing return somewhere but I’m gonna keep this df/gf “cleansing diet” up! Because I’ve been in Plateau Ville for quite some time almost up until now.

1m4rlpf,loseit,52 yo man starting weight-loss journey- suggestions?,"I’m an average guy who has always struggles with weight.  depression tends to send me down some bad habits- not using as an excuse just the reality.  I don’t like the small town I live in but I caregive for my parents - one of whom has developed some serious health issues this year- so moving is not an option.  also a social anxiety type introvert so joining a group has its own challenges.  

 last time I felt healthy was 2 years ago- had saved money and went to Europe for 3 months.  hiking and wondering ruins and museums was hard at first but by the end I was in my feet and walking from morning until late at night, actually eating fairly decent and was stronger then I felt in years.  and I lost 50lbs… I was down to 244.  walking all day didn’t wind me like it did at the start, and large hills and towns with uneven steps (109 from where my room was down to the restaurant and water area in one coastal Italian town) didn’t faze me.  the sun and sea water all contributed to where I felt better then I had in years.  but that was not something I can repeat due to $$$, so time to make changes at home.

came home and the day to day routine just gave me zero motivation, depression set it and two years later- while I did go back up to 298lbs, I am now down to 271lbs with diet changes, I need to start doing more.  on top of caregiving I started a stressful toxic job in April and given the insanity of it, the daily pressure on my chest, no at 170/110, and the anxiety, I need to make changes now.  saw a doctor, took some time off, and we discussed a few things- I am eating ok, -we are a cooking family- so vegetables and protein every evening-but need to drop breads and sugar (coffee, soda only time I use), daily exercise and keep a regular sleep schedule.

normally when I have started at the gym (which I am starting tomorrow), I head straight to cardio.  I have asthma but a few preventative shots before I start tend to not make that an issue.  I am also focusing on sleeping, and have started baths and controlled breathing (helped in past for the anxiety).  cannot walk outside as we are covered in forest fire smoke (see asthma), so gym is my option.

i am here as I am trying to find a routine to do.  most times I wander the gym and while the treadmill will assist with getting me to the point where I can hold me own in a gym, I just fumble around the rest, trying to find the right exercises to do.  my focus is back strength - as that is usually what I hurt when I start this routine- legs just need firming up and have an ok idea what to do there.  mostly mimic others for chest and arms.

any place I can find a good beginners workout?  not looking for supplements, and would prefer not to spend money on apps unless I talk to others that use them.  any you tubers for overweight men in 50s trying to slim down. help?

1m49hod,loseit,Weight Loss Suggestions,"For reference I am 24F, 5’1, 192, BMI 36, I have very muscular legs and a decent chest so I carry a bit of my weight in those areas that’s not just fat.

I do have some GI issues and I have PCOS as well as I’m on blood pressure medication for another problem so I know my metabolism isn’t the best. I used to do hard core ROTC pt team back in HS and after that I was fairly active off and on throughout college and now. I go to the gym 3/4 times a week and bike 8-10 miles almost every other day. I dropped to a calorie deficit of 1k-1200; yet I still can’t break this down. The main reason I’m losing weight is to feel better in my skin; but I also just got tired of my doctors blaming all my health problems on my weight, so I’m trying to prove my point in a healthy w ay. I don’t wanna drop calories any lower as I already feel like I’m not getting enough sometimes, but dropping to that calorie deficit amount has been the only successful thing that has helped me lose any weight.

I can't exercise due to disability but my disability isn't something that causes weight gain in theory, it's just severe arthritis. I've been sweating a lot because it's been hot this week and I've kept on top of my health otherwise, no major changes except my grandma passing in December which caused me to start gaining weight by not being careful with what I ate over Christmas because I was already mourning. I own up to that part, but now I'm doing nearly everything 'right' I don't know what to do. I can't eat much less than I do without feeling dizzy or nauseous.

1m3r3fp,loseit,Supporting partner in weight loss journey,"Hi folks, my boyfriend is starting a fat loss journey and I want to support him as much as possible. He plays lots of sports and lives a pretty active life but because of his busy lifestyle, his diet has been a secondary thought. He also has crohn’s disease which makes it hard for him to digest fibres and starchy carbs. So he mainly eats clean proteins and quick sugars for energy (with spaced out “regular” high carb meals every few days). 

We don’t live together (will be moving out in a couple of months) but we spend most of our free time together. We also both work remotely and tend to do lots of our work together at coffee shops and libraries. 

He estimates his calories but knowing how busy he is, the priority is clearly not put on his overall nutrition. I don’t want him to just start skipping meals which is what he has done last year when trying to go on a cut. Any advice on how to best support him without being overly invasive? ie actually being helpful to the health journey instead of enabling quick fixes.

1m3mt8r,loseit,Halfway there!,"Hello all! Long time lurker and first time poster.

Earlier this year, I (22M, 5'10/178cm) reached my heaviest weight of 252 lbs after steadily climbing there since finishing high school. I used to be very active (working outdoors, weightlifting elective, and doing Jiu-Jitsu), so that plus being a teenage boy equaled me eating pretty much whatever I wanted and maintaining 180 lb give or take. Pandemic happened, started college, and quit the outdoors job - you can imagine what happened.

Fast forward to earlier this year, I hit my breaking point: my clothes barely fit me, I sweat like hell if it's the slightest bit above room temperature, and I'm now in a career which depends on my ability to pass a physical every year (diabetes and cardiovascular conditions are both show-stoppers!). The candid photos were also horrid, and I was, quite frankly, having a hard time finding a date.

On the 23rd of March, I decided enough was enough, downloaded MFP, and signed up for the gym near my house. From then on it was weights 4x/week, a 2-mile walk on days I don't lift, and 2,000 calories per day.

For the first month or so, I felt miserable both physically and mentally (I was also dealing with some emotions concerning romantic feelings towards a friend that weren't reciprocated.) My body was screaming at me the mornings after I lifted, and I was *so damn hungry* since this was my first real, intentional deficit in years.

The next month, it got a little easier. I started to share what was going on with me with friends and family, started taking creatine, and dipped my feet into meal prepping. First NSVs:

* Started journaling
* Mom was the first to say I looked slimmer, but at 10 pounds down she was probably just trying to make me feel better. Love you mom <3
* I stopped being so sore after the gym, and it also started to feel wrong if I missed a session.
* I started paying attention to protein intake, and realized how if I spend my calories wisely, I won't be starving before mealtimes.

The month after that, I could truthfully say I felt good. I cut back the alcohol a bit (I still love an occasional glass of mead), the fat was melting off at roughly 1.5lb per week, and I was steadily increasing the weights I could lift. NSVs from this time period:

* Dipped my feet into meal prepping! This saved me a lot of money, since before this, the most reliable way for me to keep track of my calories on-the-fly was expensive, processed, ready-to-eat stuff that had nutrition info on the packaging.
* Treated myself to clothes shopping, and while I was out, bought a new belt since the one I had was starting to slip, even when it was the tightest it would go.
* My posture improved, and my arms/pecs started to look a little more defined.
* The unsolicited diet advice started to roll in. Carbs this, keto that, blah blah blah. Weird how the advice givers aren't having as much success with their own weight loss, but it's rude to point that out to them directly.

More recently, other people were starting to notice. A couple of my coworkers quietly confided in me that they were also losing weight, and I started looking different to myself in the mirror. Yesterday morning I weighed 213 pounds, a little more than halfway to my GW of 180. Some of the more recent NSVs:

* My sister's girlfriend knew I was losing weight, but when she saw me for the first time in a couple months, she said ""WOAH"" first thing after seeing me. Rode that high the rest of the day.
* I've started taking gym selfies, and I actually like how I look in them. Double chin is mostly gone as well!
* My confidence has risen high enough to come clean about my feelings for the aforementioned friend, and while they can't say they feel the same way currently, they're at least open to a date next week. Doesn't matter to me how the date itself goes, honestly - I wouldn't have reached out if I weren't mentally prepared. Fingers crossed, but I'll still be okay if it doesn't work out like I'm hoping.
* Chest day is now the closest thing I have to a religion.

It's been a good chunk of this year, but at the same time, it all feels so fast. To finish it off, here's a list of ""hacks"" I've figured out:

* Artificial sweeteners are great when you don't have some nerd screaming in your ear about how they're not natural. Severe Coke Zero addiction has been acquired on my end.
* Adding onto this, if you're at a restaurant and order diet soda, dip your fingers in it to test - if they're sticky, they accidentally gave you full sugar.
* Sugar free jello plus fat-free Reddi Whip equals a super tasty dessert with so few calories that I don't even bother counting it.
* Eating stuff with chopsticks (not just asian food) slows me down and helps me feel satiated, since a problem I had was with eating too fast and then eating more before I let myself feel satiated.
* The 4 piece crispy strips from Mcdonalds are 40g of protein for 460 calories; pretty good for fast food.
* Mustard and many different hot sauces are either zero calories or a negligible amount.
* I swapped my coffee and creamer for a sugar-free energy drink in the morning. Less calories and still wakes me up, plus the fizz helps me feel fuller until lunch time.
* The joy of sitting down to relax after the most *diabolical* chest/arms day is unmatched. Lift heavy, 8-10 rep range, 8 sets per muscle group per week, and burn calories both during the workout and also the recovery. Maybe it's my growing gymbro streak, but cardio is overrated imo. DM me if you want my workout routine!

1m38wmm,loseit,The only thing I'm losing is my mind.,"I'm struggling and at my wits end. I'll take any ideas at this point. Bear with me as I try to be as comprehensive as possible: I'm late 30sf and 215 lbs, gaining an average of 2 lbs a week the last month from a previous stable weight of 200 which was still higher for me, but my average weight since the pandemic and having a kid. The extra weight was gained over 6 months of taking Zoloft. I was 200 lbs for over a year until a surgery in mid March after which I couldn't do cardio or yoga for 8 weeks. I'm also about a month out from tapering completely off of Zoloft which I feel influenced my weight gain. I started Metformin last weekend and GAINED 2 pounds since. What the hell?!

I don't binge eat or struggle with junk. I love water and raw veggies even without sauce or dressing. I'm not an athlete, but I run 15+ miles a week. I've actually never been so fit and have beat my 10 year distance PR 5 times in the last 3 weeks. I also take my kid to the playground every day weather permitting and have to shadow her constantly because she's insane, so I'm basically always running around. I also do PT-prescribed stretches and yoga to keep myself flexible. The only thing I don't do is weight train, but I'm also constantly toting around my 30+lb kid. I *feel* great physically after dealing with POTS symptoms triggered by COVID last year. The year before that, I had mono so bad my hair hurt and my lab values were off the charts. It's nice to not be weak or have the room spin when I stand. I'm just heavy.

I cut out candy and snacks because my only vice is sweets. I seldom drink my calories and NEVER have sweetened soda or sweet tea-- if I get a rare craving, I get a single diet coke out. Once a week I get a pastry or cookie under 400 calories from Panera and that's what makes life livable for me. I drink alcohol maybe 1x a month and not to excess, typically only white wine. I take my coffee with unsweetened plant milk and Splenda. I have two medium coffees a day but seldom finish them because I have a kid and school and errands every day.

I submit an honest food log to my doctor a year ago when I had stomach issues and was embarrassed, but he said I ate better than any of his other patients... while diagnosing me with stress related anorexia nervosa. This mystified me because my weight had been stable and I lost all my postpartum weight within a year of giving birth. I asked what that was about and he said to try to eat more regularly(honestly I'd forget to eat until late afternoon every day), which I have been for months now. I've been taking care of myself eating a lot of lean protein and fresh fruits and veggies and I don't want to fall back on forgetting to eat again. I''m feeling desperate.  I had a lab panel including cortisol just last month and my sugars are great, cortisol fine, all labs textbook perfect as a whole. My doctor doesn't have any more ideas for me and said my habits are healthier than his even though I've seen him at the gym🫠

I can't physically eat too much fat and never have been able to because it makes me sick, so that's not it either. I enjoy whole grain carbs in moderation like oatmeal, rice. My main snack is fresh rotating seasonal fruit and occasionally turkey jerky, I don't snack on crackers etc. My main protein is grilled chicken followed by beans/legumes and occasionally red meat or fish. I don't eat a lot of fast/convenience food. I'm not perfect for sure, but I just don't know what else to cut out or down. I have between 1500-2000 calories a day which is well within my TDEE allotment without starving myself.

I'm most comfortable at 175 so that's where I'd like to be and what I think is completely reasonable. I'm just at a complete loss here. l AM under an immense amount of stress with academia and family issues but as I mentioned, my cortisol is supposedly fine. Because of my exercise, I have a decent regular sleeping schedule occasionally thwarted by having a toddler. I don't smoke anything(yet when I did use medical mj I was thinner!). I don't know what else I can do or cut out that's healthy and within reason, but I'm getting married soon and it's driving me nuts that all my hard work is only causing me to gain weight 😭 My future husband says we're just getting old and I can't reschedule the wedding because I feel fat, so I appreciate any and all tips, pointers, suggestions for questions for my doctor, etc!",2025-07-18 17:44:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m38wmm/the_only_thing_im_losing_is_my_mind/
1m2zxwm,loseit,I’m not saying fasted cardio is bad but it’s just not for me,"What’s a “healthy” habit you were sure was helping, but actually made thing harder?

For me, it was fasted workout sessions. I really thought training on an empty stomach would burn more fat, because of course I saw it online, so every morning I’d get up, drink coffee, and get straight on the treadmill without eating.

It felt like I was doing something extra, like being more disciplined or whatever. I could literally feel the pit in my stomach xd

I was crashing halfway through my workouts.
I’d be starving by late afternoon and end up overeating And I was just in a bad mood most of the day or drained.

after eating something small before my workouts. Not big—half a banana or a little protein shake and suddenly things got way better. I had more energy, didn’t feel out of control with food later, and my workouts kinda stayed the same but it was fine cause I was doing more 

Also I’ve been using a treadmill I found through [budgetstride](https://budgetstride.com). It wasn’t expensive, kinda cheapish, but it’s solid and does what I need. Having something simple at home has made it easier to stay consistent without having to worry about heat 

Sometimes what feels “hardcore” is actually just making it harder to stay on track. Curious if anyone else had a habit like that they had to let go of.",2025-07-18 11:35:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m2zxwm/im_not_saying_fasted_cardio_is_bad_but_its_just/
1m2rv0a,loseit,Gained 60lbs in the last 7 months,"So I am on the waiting list to see endocrinology, years ago in my mid 20s I had a problem with hypothyroidism and my hormones being all out of whack. After some synthroid and hormone therapy for three years things improved. My doctors pulled me off of synthroid and hormone therapy. I did fine managing my weight, normal energy, and all for about 6 years. Then all of a sudden I came down with an illness and I’ve been struggling for the last few years to get a proper diagnosis for it, meanwhile I became pre diabetic. We worked to get that under control and it was for roughly a year. Then in December 2024 I went to see my PCP and my glucose levels were sky high and I gained 4lbs. Well went back to the doctors in June and I had gained 53 pounds. My doctors did blood work and put me back on synthroid while I wait to see endocrinology. I’m not a big eater. I always forget to eat breakfast and lunch so I normally live off of caffeine and I have cut my two pots down to one pot a day. I no longer use sugar in my coffee and only sugar free creamer. I’m not a big fan of pop, and prefer homemade sweet tea (so I can control the sweetness and use stevia) or lemonade. I’ve recently started using my isolate protein powder in my coffee before I do my morning workout routine. Seems no matter how hard I try I keep seeming to gain weight. My husband had an issue with his blood pressure and triglycerides a few years ago so I switch to a good amount of plant based and heart healthy fats. He’s good now and was actually able to drop 30lbs and get off his meds for it, me not so much. 

Any advice on what I can do to stop the gain? I track my calories and on average I pull in about 1200 a day. On top of 30 minutes of cardio a day I’ve made sure to increase my step count to 15000 a day, and add 3-4 strength training days and 2-3 yoga days. 

Also I heard putting protein powder in coffee makes the protein powder useless, so should I stop? I actually feel like it gives me a longer boost without the jitters, but I don’t want to consume useless calories.

1m22sg2,loseit,Water weight and calorie deficit question,"So, I've been doing a bit of a weight loss journey for some time now. Mainly not taking in any dead calories/liquid calories (no coffee which I like light and sweet, minimal bread and carbs, and just tracking my caloric intake overall) 

I didn't start this until I was 236lbs (although a month or so prior I was 248lbs) may 19th I was 236lbs. Now about 2 months later I am 215.4 lbs. Roughly 20 lbs lost. But for the most part I don't notice a big difference. My shorts are a bit more loose, my xl shirts are at the cusp of being changed to just Larges. 

Calorie wise I bring in around 1300-1700 a day, at work I burn anywhere from 100-300 calories depending on how the day goes (walking and doing truck repairs and such). weekends I do ""rucking"" on a treadmill at home (bookbag with 35lbs of lead in it wrapped in 5 towels) for about 30 to 45mins at 3.5-4mph both saturday and sunday. I drink roughly 32-40 oz of water a day. the rest of liquid intake is 1-2 sugar feee 10 calorie energy drinks which I'm starting to cut back on now and I allow myself 16 ounce of sweet tea as a gift every day when I get home from my 10-12hr shift 

I know it's a lot of context but is this all water weight? what process does your body do with a calorie deficit? Other's have told me that I am going to plateau, is this true? How come I haven't plateaued yet?",2025-07-17 09:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m22sg2/water_weight_and_calorie_deficit_question/
1m1w1j4,loseit,Should I raise my calorie target?,"I have been aiming for a target of 2100*ish* calories for the last few months and have been having some success, but at the expense of being ridiculously hungry in the evenings. I usually consume around 800 calories throughout the day with b'fast and lunch, and then have the balance in the evening. However it doesn't seem to be holding me and I end up hungry in the evening hours.

 Sailrabbit shows my TDEE as 2,896 on the Mifflin St Jeor model, and 3,108 on the Harris Benedict model, being 5'9"", 46 and 220 lbs. I'm considering putting my calorie target up to 2500 or more. Is this a bad idea or is there something else I can do to make this more sustainable? Perhaps change my calorie distribution throughout the day? 

I work in a institutional kitchen in a health care facility and get upwards of 8,000 to 12,000 steps a day. Gym has not come into play just yet as I wanted to get more weight off before I start back at that. It's not hard labor, or heavy work, but I hustle all day long and sweat a lot. I should be dropping weight faster but I'm having such issues with hunger that it is a futile effort at this rate.

For reference, I usually eat the same thing everyday as far as b'fast and lunch goes. 125g of greek yogurt at 6am, 44g of dry vector cereal on the way to work around 9am, and then lunch is 30g of cashews(15g per meal, eaten all at once), 200g-ish of honeycrisp apple, and a 30g V8 spicy, on the way back to home base around 11:30am. If I have time I have a protein mocha made with a fairlife choc. Protein drink, 400g of Stok cold brew coffee and 2 pumps of sugar free mocha syrup. That is roughly 750-800 calories by noon. 

What could I change to make this more bearable?

1m1gwge,loseit,main goal: lose 50 pounds.,"I'm 5.2ft (29f) and my weight is 168 pounds... which for me that's overweight, I recently found that I'm developing insulin resistance and for me that was a wakeup call, because my mom has type 1 diabetes and she has a lot of health struggles because of it, even though she takes care of herself, her blood sugar can go low out of nowhere she's been in coma 3 times, once at 9years old the second time at35 and then at 38.

Honestly it scares me knowing that I'm very close to have diabetes if I don't start taking care of myself, so I want to lose 50 pounds to reverse my insulin resistance, and this week I started to make some changes, I cut all sugared drinks like soda (my biggest addiction) and all added sugar foods.

on Monday and Tuesday: I had for breakfast unsweetened greek yogurt with 9 grams of protein, berries and a black coffee. grilled veggies for lunch and grilled veggies with cheese for dinner.  
Today I was running late so I just had unsweetened greek yogurt with 12 grams of protein and black coffee.  
I started to walk 6,000 steps a day; my goal is reach 13,000 by the end of the month. so far, I feel good and happy with myself however I started to feel more exhausted and sleep more, it was very hard to get out of the bed the on Tuesday and today, is it normal???

also, I have a lot of cravings for soda, so I'm drinking sparkling water instead.



Please give me some advice about losing weight, and how reverse insulin resistance thanks \^\^",2025-07-16 16:16:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m1gwge/main_goal_lose_50_pounds/
1m1dn62,loseit,"Fluke? Or something else? Also, looking for advice","I weighed in at 249.6 this morning. Yesterday I was 250.9. I’ve lost 36.7 pounds over the course of a year, though for 6 months I wasn’t being mindful what I ate so I maintained my weight loss, I just didn’t lose it. 

Decided to start back up June 1st and lost 10 pounds by July 3rd. 

I use the loseit app and it says, based on my lifestyle, I should eat 1200 calories to lose 2 pounds a week. I have a pretty sedentary job and while I have an elliptical at home I haven’t used it in over a month. 

Now, I use the 1200 as a guide. I go over daily and I’m okay with that. My goal is a lifestyle change not a diet, because I want to maintain the weight loss 

Monday I ate 1500 calories. 
Tuesday I ate 1900 calories. And still lost weight

I have noticed that when I eat close to the 1200 calories I don’t lose weight but the second I eat 500 or more calories over the 1200 I end up losing weight. 

Is this just a coincidence? I understand the whole thing about your body going into starvation mode but does that still apply for someone who weighs 249 pounds?  

Also, I had thyroid cancer so I no longer have a thyroid and rely on pills to help my metabolism and all the other things your thyroid does. 

A typical day for me is:

Coffee with milk, no sugar
Stonyfield no sugar added yogurt pouches (2) 

Sandwich that consists of 2 pieces of wheat bread, 4 slices of lunch meat and a slice of cheese. No condiments. 

A package of the HEB version of goldfish crackers 

Whatever my husband cooks for dinner, usually a meat and a veggie. A lot of times it’s a boxed meal like jambalaya or red beans and rice. I try to eat light during the day so that I don’t have to worry about what he’s cooking.

I know I don’t get nearly enough protein, the app says I need 109 grams and I get about 70 so I did buy naked whey brand protein powder and plan to mix it with milk or something to give myself more protein. 

So any idea what’s going on with the weight loss? It is normal to lose more the day after you eat a lot? Or is it just a coincidence?

1lxejiv,xxfitness,"Usually strength train fasted, now going to try eating before - what and how much?","I’m not really a big breakfast person and I don’t drink coffee. I usually strength train for about 45-60 minutes around 9-10am, and then have a fruit smoothie made with a protein shake and an oatmeal muffin when I’m done. I’ll eat lunch around 2-3pm, dinner around 6-7pm, and snack as needed.

I work out 4 weekdays (normally getting up naturally a little before my alarm and going in fasted): two 20 min lifting days, and two hour long Vinyasa yoga classes. Every day, immediately folllowing my workout, I have a balanced breakfast with protein and fiber and all that. I’ll wait 30 minutes or so to have a coffee after that.

On the lifting days, this works great and I feel great all day. On the yoga days, usually an hour or two after my workout, I get super angry and irritable. I find myself snapping at people at work, and having a really short fuse. I know I’m not hangry — I don’t feel hungry and easily make it to lunch.

Why is this happening, and why just on the yoga days and not the lifting days? Anything I can try to prevent it?

My last chance is at the beginning of the next month (where 12 pushups are required), and I'm stressing a bit about it.

The other elements of the test are still a challenge to me (running 1.5 miles in 17:30, 23 situps), although I feel more confident I can meet them by the deadline.

I'm not sure if I'm age/weight is relevant, but I'm 36 and unfortunately still quite obese (BMI 30) and should be about 40 pounds less WITH max muscle. I heard restricting calories can hamstring fitness if done incorrectly, so I'm not currently going out of my way to count calories or restrict myself. I limit eating to 6 hours a day, try to eat only unprocessed food, and have some coffee with milk in the morning.

~~(I don't drink alcohol at all, so unfortunately there's nothing easy to cut to save calories lol).~~

My absolute best pushup count (going down to the full 2-3 inches) was 9 at the beginning of April, but I'm honestly struggling to go past 5 at a time not even a week later. I feel terribly weak. My questions —

1. Will doing more reps per day (50+ in 5-6 pushup bursts) be effective for increasing my overall capacity quickly?
2. What other muscles/exercises should I work on to make it easier for me to do pushups?

1iqzek8,xxfitness,HELP! Is it normal to feel constantly hungry after starting weight training?,"Hey everyone, I’m new here and excited to join this community. I love the support and hype in this community! 

I’m just getting back into weight training after many years of neglecting it. For context, I’m turning 38 in March, I’m a parent of two, and I already incorporate a good amount of cardio and high-intensity training into my routine each week. 

My activity in a week looks something like this: 
2-3 days intense bouldering 
2-3 days weight training 
1-2 active rest days hike or brisk walk with hills 
At least 1 “lazy rest day” no expectations but the normal daily living activities and house cleaning plus chasing a toddler around lol 

Since starting weight training about two weeks ago, I’ve noticed that I am ravenous all the time...like a bottomless pit. Sometimes, I even wake up in the middle of the night “starving”, which is completely abnormal for me and honestly kind of scary. Is this normal? I am making sure that I am drinking lots of water as well. Will it taper off, or should I be taking a closer look at my calorie intake and macros? I feel like something might be missing.

For reference:
*I’m 5’7” and around 128 lbs (depending on the time of the month, lol).
*I’m not 100% sure of my body fat percentage, but based on measurements, I’d estimate around 18%.
*My goal with weight training is to FEEL strong, and attempt a proper body recomposition for the first time in my life. I have long-term health and wellness goals, but also, let’s be real—some slightly vain ones too! I’d love to be in the best shape of my life before 40. More than anything, I want to keep up with my kids, stay strong for my active hobbies, and feel great while remaining injury-free.

For supplements, I’m currently taking:
*A daily multivitamin
*Magnesium and electrolyte powder in a glass of water
*5g of creatine (split into two servings throughout the day, just started about a week ago)
*100% pure whey isolate protein powder to help boost my protein intake, especially on crazy busy days chasing a toddler around
*BCAAs for extra support
*A scoop of MCT marine collagen in my daily coffee
*On workout days, I take a really nice pre-workout with BCAAs, some adaptogens, and a hint of caffeine, it gives me an even boost without making me feel jittery or buzzy

I’d love any insight or advice from those who’ve been through this! Does the hunger level out? Am I just not eating enough? I am averaging at least 2000 calories a day which seems like a lot…and a good amount of protein (like 120-140+ grams) I should add that I have been doing Keto for nearly 2 months, so my macros look a bit different.

I don't want to do HIIT, poof....they send me HIIT workouts.  
My list of things I am willing to do is significantly longer that the list of things I am not interested in doing, but every darn time they take the two or three things I am not willing to do and suggest I do them. The not listening to me after taking my time to be very clear makes me say screw it every time.

z2f4xh,xxfitness,What is your daily protein goal (if you have one) and what is your exercise routine?,"Hello! I wanted to ask about others’s protein intake in relation to their workout regime. Do you feel like you are getting enough protein to support your goals? Have you tried different levels of protein intake and how have they worked for you? Do you not worry about it and just focus on working out?

Myself, I have been working out 4-6 days a week for about two years, primarily lifting with occasional walking or elliptical thrown in for cardio health. My main goals are increased strength and muscle mass, especially upper body. When I first started lifting I wasn’t paying much attention to protein intake besides adding a protein shake to my morning coffee routine, I had pretty good early newbie gains. After a while my progress was slowing so I started to loosely track my protein with a goal of 100 grams a day, which wasn’t particularly difficult and I did see a little bit better progress. Recently I’ve been aiming for 150 grams and I think I’m seeing more progress than with 100 grams but it’s really been a struggle to get to 150.

I know there’s lots of literature out there about optimal protein intake but I want to hear about others’s personal experiences, especially from other women who are focused on lifting, but also those who are more into running, sports, etc.",2022-11-23 04:21:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/z2f4xh/what_is_your_daily_protein_goal_if_you_have_one/
wb8w7e,xxfitness,"DEXA + RMR test results for a 5'9"" 32F 136ish lb female","[Test result screenshots and pics of me within a couple days of the tests](https://imgur.com/a/rVDURqY)

Estimated myself to be 22-25% body fat, actual was 18.3% (the lady giving me results said 18.2% so I'm not sure if the extra .1% is rounded up from the .003lb of visceral fat but the report I received said 18.3%). Weighed in at 139lbs during the test but this was a wet weight, I am lower in the evening (~136lbs) before I eat for the day.

Estimated I burned 1750cal at rest, actual was 2287 (!!!!). This makes a lot of sense given my consistent progress while overeating on the weekends fairly often. 

I have another competition 9/24 and scheduled a DEXA scan and RMR for a couple days prior. I have done a bunch of metabolism blood tests through Everlywell to check my free testosterone since I _think_ I was able to successfully boost it through natural means, but each one did not have enough blood sampled to complete the test. Hopefully I can get my fingers to bleed more because I am oh-so curious what the numbers are. I was at 14.9pg/mL free T back in December. In theory you would need 100g of bull testicles to replicate the amount of test an adult male creates so taking 1.2g daily would only be a slight boost.

My protocol:

# supps

* opti-women multivitamin (2x capsules daily)
* fish oil (1000mg daily)
* creatine (5g+ daily)
* BCAAs (5g - 20g daily)
* tukesterone (500mg twice daily - started 11/23/21)
* bull testicles lmao (1200mg daily - started 5/25/22)
* d-aspartic acid (2000mg daily - started 5/27/22)

# diet

* calories in, calories out - weigh errythang, read nutrition facts and look for errors like says 0cals but also claims to have protein and carbs - go off macro values (4cal per g carb and protein, 9cal per g of fat)
* typically in a 500-1000cal+ deficit M-F then eat to maintenance or a lil over on the weekend
* prioritize protein, then fiber + micros and from fruit + veg
* fill in the rest of calories with stuff that makes me feel like i'm cheating on my diet
* shrimp, chicken breast, broccoli, cherries and berries are staples but i go through phases
* getting ~250g protein most days but it's not necessary - law of thermodynamics would mean i put out more energy breaking down protein so there's some potential minmaxing going on here but i'm not relying on it lol
* intermittent fast - sometimes for 24+ hours - but it's naturally how i eat (large meal / snacks at night, no breakfast or lunch) - doubt that i'm burning more fat in a fasted state but who knows - this is the only reason why i take BCAAs daily (prevent my body from eating lean mass for fuel) but i also drink black coffee, ACV, etc. that'll trigger an insulin response so likely not  t r u l y  fasted but w/e i enjoy it

# exercise 

* i don't sit until evening if i don't have to - don't have back pain like i used to several years ago
* 50lb weighted vest doing stairs at a lvl 9 - 10 for 35m if i do cardio at the gym, otherwise it's all weights/machines _if_ i go to the gym (big if lol, been once since August 2021)
* in a cut i'll do 25k - 35k steps on weekdays while working - probably have an addiction to my treadmill desk - but otherwise averaging over 15k a day, if i didn't i wouldn't be able to eat 2000cal+ and still lose weight
* hypertrophy training - go to failure unless injury risk - rule of 8 (if i can do more than 4 sets of 8 reps i up the weight (including if the last set or two i only hit 8 reps but first ones are 10+)) my body needs to know i'm struggling to move some shit and it better grow or else
* dance dance revolution - basically HIIT? idk adds a lil cal burn",2022-07-29 16:15:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/wb8w7e/dexa_rmr_test_results_for_a_59_32f_136ish_lb/
vfrtc2,xxfitness,"Race report - Grandma’s Marathon, Duluth, MN","So.. I thought I’d write this up here, rather than r/running. It’s currently 4am, the day after the race. My body did not want to sleep, so coffee+Reddit before I drive home :) First part will be about the race itself, then it will be about how I did at the bottom….

I ran Grandma’s Marathon yesterday, it’s a very popular race, this was race #43, it’s been going on since 1979. It’s very scenic, it’s run almost entirely along Lake Superior, from start until about mile 16-17  is lake side and it finishes in Duluth. Duluth itself is on the border of Wisconsin (Superior, WI is the sister city) and Minnesota and is a stunning town - very vintage industrial, gorgeous mansions, with a revived and lively lakefront recreational/shopping area. Tons of breweries, great food, lively and friendly locals.

There are 10,000 half marathon participants and 9,000 marathon runners. The evening before is a 5k as well, seemed to be popular, but not huge. The town itself expected 1MM visitors this weekend for race events - Duluth itself has less than 100,000 residents.

The half marathon is run before the marathon, both finish in downtown Duluth. The marathon starts at 7:45 am, busses or the TRAIN (yes, passenger train cars!) leave starting at 5:30am or so. The ride to the start was orderly, plenty of busses and efficient. The race start had TONS of portapotties. So many. Still there were lines. We had the singing of the national anthem, two F16s flew over, and we were off.

Aid stations every 2 miles to start, every mile at the end. TONS of local support and cheering. Lots of fruit (a friend got strawberries at an aid station, she said it was the best strawberry she’s every had), and tons of volunteers - I can’t understate the volunteer work that went into this. There were medic tents regularly, Vaseline stations, mobile medics, etc. On course gels were actually maple syrup - wild. 

Race was rolling hills, scenic and beautiful. No shade, very exposed, we had a nice breeze and it was warm enough to run in a tank and shorts (60F). The finish going into downtown Duluth was raucous. The temps started dropping fast and it was getting cold. Spectators were wearing hoodies and puffer jackets at this point. The last six miles felt pretty rough - I’m a trail runner and 20+ miles of pavement is hard on the body.

Finish was amazing. Tons of support, very organized. Lots of snacks- fruit, yogurt, bagels, milk, cookies, dill pickle potato chips (YES!). There was a blister tent. Mylar wraps (it was SO COLD at this point), shirts, and medals handed out. Downside - the shirts are lame and ill fitting. 

For post race - Duluth has tons of food options. We ate at Smokehaus. Pizza from Green Mill looked so good, and there are tons of breweries and pubs. The most pleasant part is that all seemed fully staffed, no waits, food was fast, it was kinda of amazing. 

So… my race. I was really hopping for a 3:50 marathon, 8:46 pace. I was pretty sure I could do 3:55 based on my training paces and miles and I KNEW I could do sub 4 hours. So much for that. I think I had a few things against me… 

1. I ran an ultra five weeks ago. Probably minor impact.
2. I have an ankle issue - I keep rolling it and it hurts. I also think I might have a stress fracture that is related. I’ll go to the doctor this week.
3. Covid. I had Covid, with symptoms (fever, chills, muscle aches, respiratory, etc), between races. I am not sure I’m fully recovered. I had a LOT of issues with pace in this race. I kept having to slow down to recover. I didn’t need to walk, but I definitely wasn’t at the pace I wanted or felt I should have been able to hold. 
4. Temps. the temperature and weather was perfect, almost deceivingly so. I think the cool temp and the breeze dehydrated me way more than I realized. My fellow runners felt the same. We were never sweaty, but I think the breeze kept us dry.

My end results… 4:20. 9:53 pace. Not what I wanted, but glad I had the experience and got it done.",2022-06-19 09:56:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/vfrtc2/race_report_grandmas_marathon_duluth_mn/
vemouu,xxfitness,[Write Up] Cutting Weight & MacroFactor,"hey all! [uploading pictures/graphs momentarily]

you might just recognize me from, well, being on this sub all the time. i just finished up a major cut (with a major break in between). i wrote a little bit about it [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/rul3oa/sbs_hypertrophy_review_a_squatless_bastardization/) when I finished the first part of it at the beginning of 2022. 

as i mentioned in a previous post, i got a nasty wake up call re: my weight when i went camping last summer. i baked in the heat and i was super de-conditioned and struggled on mostly flat hikes.

##tl;dr

* total length of cut including breaks: 8.5 months (September 2021 - June 2022)
* weight lost: (as of this morning) 40 lbs 
* (flexed) progress pics: [before](https://imgur.com/a/mwS85r5) / [after](https://imgur.com/a/5ZTnw3k)

## About Me

cis lady. 29.5 years old. i competed in an endurance sport for 15 years through college (swimming). in college i was introduced to the weight room which sparked my lifting curiosity. when i hung up my goggles and became a ""swammer,"" i got more interested in lifting as a way to achieve my new aesthetic goals. (previously adding too much muscle was a concern since i was a distance swimmer). our lifting program while i was swimming wasn't very good. it essentially was linear progression the entire season which would gas me out for my later swim practice (we did two a days).

now i just lift. i went to law school with a solid gym and ended up working there while in school/while studying for the bar. i really started to get into lifting then. now i'm a tired attorney that built a home gym in my building's garage. at some point i'd like to compete in some sort of powerlifting comp, but i still don't feel safe yet going to comps while covid is still happening. i am also super fortunate in the fact that (thanks to union protections) i am still working from home. my job requires me to answer the phone and give confidential legal advice. i cannot be walking anywhere and talking calls for work. thus my job has me very sedentary.

thanks to doing a mostly non-contact sport i have a lot less injuries than most athletes. i have some hip issues and some rotator cuff tendinitis but otherwise it's pretty chill.

aesthetically, i want to look fucking jacked. i am not worried about looking ""too muscular"". i don't think the level of muscle i want is typical of most women want, so that might be something to keep in mind in terms of how i approached this cut.

* SBS Hypertrophy

## Methodology

in the past i've used RP templates and just straight up MyFitnessPal (MFP). i have cut as low as 1200 calories per day (don't do this) while still also lifting. last time i did a major cut i got down to as low as 120 lbs but was overall a bit dissatisfied with my physique. i was wondering where the definition i was expecting to have went. did i need to cut even lower? NO! 

i had cut too hard and lost some muscle mass in the process. some muscle loss during a cut is likely unavoidable but i had cut too fast :(.

i decided to give MacroFactor (MF) a try because i found that when i put myself in charge of my calories i would tend to overreact to losses/gains and swing my calories in an extreme direction. i decided it was worth it to me to pay for something that could handle all of that as long as i fed it info. i was a bit worried that weighing myself every day would make me obsess over my weight but it actually de-stigmatized weighing in for me. this will obviously vary depending on who you are, but i thought that was an interesting anecdote.

to be safe i set my goal rate to a bit below 1%/week of weight loss. i would have certainly hit my goal weight faster had i not taken nearly 2 months off during the winter holidays (Dec 2022 and Jan 2022), but not having to stress about it was worth it to me.

i'll admit that i was not always the best about giving MF data. that being said, i still got a lot of super useful and actionable information (for my diet) about my TDEE and my weight loss trends.

### Reflections

#### Choosing MacroFactor

i'll be honest, i went into this cut absolutely DREADING it. i have cut about this much weight before and i had gone too fast and lost a lot of strength/muscle in the process. also, last time i cut this much weight i was hungry ALL THE TIME. additionally, i was feeling a lot of regret because my weight got to this point due to a reckless dreamer bulk powered by work/covid stress. i was not looking forward to eating less.

i was already a fan of the guys at the Stronger By Science podcast and so when they mentioned that they were developing a food logger that also took a neutral approach to weight changes--i knew i was going to be interested. i did the 2 week first trial, ended up really liking the interface and its 'coaching' to adjust my calories as needed. i bought it for a year. it took a lot of the friction of doing a cut (crunching numbers, trying to change TDEE based on weekly data, etc) out of my hands and did it for me. i really initially underestimated how hard this part of cutting was for me until i didn't have to worry about it anymore. 

#### Diet & Hunger

i can count on one hand the number of times i felt really hungry and didn't have calories left. i certainly was not compliant every day or even every (i took a week long vacation where i didn't track and also took off nearly two months in the winter). i made some small changes to how i eat (less oil/fats in general when cooking), but i didn't feel like i had to meal prep to make sure i hit my calories/macros like i felt compelled to in the past. this was great for my household as my lovely girlfriend has no interest in cutting weight or really even lifting for the matter. i was able to cook ""real"" (i.e. not super weirdly healthy versions of) dishes that satisfied us both from a taste and nutrient perspective. i didn't want to have to only cook my own separate meals, and it was really important to me that we could still share the 'burden' of cooking.

my diet is pretty omnivorous although i am cursed with taste buds/a sense of smell that absolutely HATES eggs. if i hide eggs in things like fried rice, its fine. can i eat scrambled eggs straight up? nope. can i eat softboiled eggs? nah. can i stomach a simple sunny side up? no. how do i know? i have repeatedly forced myself to try different variations of eggs and sauces to try and choke them down. my mom and sister also have a similar aversion to eggs.

outside of the holidays and a few special occasions, i noticed that my drinking has gone down a ton. i am a BIG craft beer and bourbon gal. however, i noticed that even though i (still for now) don't get hangovers it still affects my sleep which ultimately affects my work/lifting performance. i wasn't a fan of that and so i cut down my drinking quite a bit. sometimes i would take the occasional THC/CBD edible to help me get to sleep if i was having issues winding down for the night. i'm not a great sleeper so this was huge for me. that being said, i certainly haven't cut out alcohol entirely. 

i did employ some strategies/tricks to help regulate any hunger that i had:

* don't eat in the morning until i'm actually hungry or about 10:30 AM (during my first break at work)
* if i'm choosing between alcohol and food calorie-wise always choose food
* don't drink your calories if you can help it! obviously this includes alcohol, but i think i only had 2 protein shakes in the last 8.5 months total. i feel way more full when i actually chew my food.
* try to sleep more. this is purely anecdotal, but i found on days were my sleep was less than great i would get hungrier faster.
* this is more for if you drink alcohol: if you find there are times where you habitually like to drink, it might be worth examining if drinking is really *that* integral to the experience. for me, later in the evening i like to play video games with my friends. i used to have a few beers or glasses of bourbon while doing so. did this really enhance the experience? not really, but i did just like having something other than flat water to drink. we ended up getting a sodastream thing and we make sparkling water with it now. i generally end up drinking sparkling water now instead of booze.
* have a large amount of veggies or fruits on hand in case you get hungry/snacky. might be a difficult adjustment if you're used to satisfying those cravings with other foods but i have no problems just quickly washing some strawberries or some spinach and chowing down on that if i'm hungry.
* on days where i know that i'm not going to be able to track well (e.g. i am eating someone else's cooking, going out to eat, etc) i'll try to keep my eating beforehand minimal but also still eat something. i'm the type that tends to overeat if i get to a certain degree of hunger.
* caffeine is probably also helpful for appetite suppression, but i use my morning latte as a nice thing i do for myself before work or as pre-workout for a lift. i tried to avoid relying on it for that purpose. sometimes i'll have a second decaf coffee depending on the day.

#### Lifting & Running

i also started running sometime in April. i haven't been super consistent with it because i took a break from running to save my legs for testing maxes at the end of SBS RTF. also i'm trying to figure out how to incorporate running into my new lifting schedule as for the last year i've been lifting 3x/week but now with The Rippler I'm lifting 4x/week. i lift on weekends and weekdays. on my week day lifts i try to lift during my one hour lunch that i take which has been working well so far. i've been unintentionally getting more conditioning here because i need to fit my entire lift in this time frame.

i somehow was able to make progress in some of my lifts. i hit a 7 lb PR in OHP and a 5 lb PR in my DL. bench unsurprisingly wasn't as successful but being in a cut seems to always tank my bench strength. i'm pretty confident i'll get back to one plate after a bit more training. running also (unsurprisingly) got easier when i started to weigh less, as there was less of me to move. lifting did certainly get increasingly more difficult as the cut progressed. i could begin to really feel the calorie deficit towards the end.

---

## Conclusions

i gain absolutely nothing from saying this, but if you're considering doing a cut i would strongly recommend considering using MF. it took a lot of the ""thinking"" out of doing the cut and i could just focus on inputting my data and going about the rest of my life. i'm very excited to keep using MF even as i begin to transition into maintenance (and eventually another shorter cut before the end of the year). i'm no longer afraid that i'm going to go off the rails and bulk like crazy like i did previously. i'm already planning out my next bulk and i'm actually excited for it.

i'm very happy with how i look and am looking forward to what i look like at 125 lbs with this level of muscle. i think i look better at 135 lbs now than i did at 120/125 lbs previously. i give a lot of credit to MF for not dropping my calories like crazy like RP and MFP did. i don't think my calories ever really dropped below 1400. the app got confused for a while and slashed my calories after i weighed myself post vacation but it did eventually recover to an extent. my TDEE is still trending back up towards ~2,000 calories a day. due to the life i've had previously about 85% of my weight training has been done while in a calorie deficit. due to the stresses of school/life transitions i would cut down to a low weight and then gain a ton of weight back and have to start again from nearly square one with my weight and lifting. i am beyond excited to see what i can do in the weight room while not training in a calorie deficit. my next major goal is a 2 plate pull (225 lbs) for deadlift and i'm somewhat confident i'll be able to add the last 20 lbs to that lift before the end of this year.

special thanks to the folks in the sub for being such a good resource/sounding board for all things related to fitness. being able to talk about my cut and lifting progress with y'all really kept me engaged in the process (a lot of my IRL friends are not interested in lifting/aesthetics)! i really appreciate this community and hope this write up gave something of value back :)",2022-06-17 18:28:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/vemouu/write_up_cutting_weight_macrofactor/

I work a busy job (think: investment banking/lawyer) with lots of fire drills throughout the day and an unpredictable end time.  On top of that, my commute is close to 45 mins each way. 

I would prefer to work out in the evenings after work, but with my schedule I don’t get back home in time for any of my gym’s later workout classes (My gym is 5 mins walking from my house). I also can’t really take long breaks during the day for a lunch workout.

So, I started going in the mornings to classes that start at 6:15 and end at 7.  Ideally I would do these classes (BODYPUMP, a circuit, or spin depending on the day) 3x during the week but some weeks it just feels impossible to get out of bed at 5:45 so I skip to sleep in (for a $5 penalty fee). I’ve also noticed that I’m much more sluggish on days I workout and find myself drinking several cups of coffee in the afternoons to stay awake.

Will waking up get easier over time? Will my body get used to the new schedule? Can I change something in my diet to give me more energy through the day?

I’ve considered just doing free weights/cardio machines on my own so I can have a little more control over my start and end time but can’t find a good 30-45 minute routine I like.

I’ve also considered switching to at home workouts but I’m locked into my gym membership for another 6 months.

I like that the gym is quiet and if I need a squat rack there’s probably one available but I am just so low on energy early in the mornings and I hate trying to make myself go to sleep by 10pm so I can get a decent amount of sleep. I’m also dead by about 10am which sucks because I work a boring desk job so it’s easy to just doze off.

ti4r9e,xxfitness,Postpartum to Pull Up: A Reflection,"In the pitch dark I manoeuvre expertly into my son’s nursery and take him out of his crib. I mechanically latch him on and settle him, and as we rock softly  I remind myself, “Don’t press snooze on your alarm this morning. You set the timer on the coffee maker, you laid out your leggings and sports bra, just get out of the bed, the rest is easy.”

I put my baby back into his crib and stealth back to my room. I glance at the time on my phone - 3:23 am. About two more hours until my alarm goes off. If he sleeps for three, I’ll have enough time for my entire workout. 

I hear the gurgling of the coffee maker before I hear my alarm. This is the hard part, right here. The decisive moment - do I drag myself out of bed, stumble into my spandex, and find my caffeine fix, or do I turn off my alarm and wake up with the kids? 

No, not today. I’m showing up for myself this morning and every morning I can until I pull myself up over that bar.


…


Hi everyone, I hope you enjoyed that intro. I’m a 29 year old mother of two, and after the birth of my son in April 2021 I decided that I wanted to do a pull-up before his first birthday. I wasn’t sure if I would make it but this week I DID IT. One strict pull-up. 

The reason I think my journey warrants a stand-alone post is because this movement is difficult for most folks, but for mothers it can seem impossible. Pregnancy and childbirth can really weaken your core and pelvic floor, and taking care of kids saps you of your energy and time. So if you’re interested in getting a pull-up as a postpartum woman, this post is for you.

I’m going to split this post into three sections: time management, training, and nutrition. 

Time management:
As a new mom, your world gets turned upside down. Even if you were a fit person before/during pregnancy, working out becomes extremely difficult. The baby is fussy, you get no sleep, and chores are piling up. It’s very hard to find a good rhythm and get into a new routine. In addition, your body feels very different. The keys to getting in my workout sessions were as follows… 1. Find my window - there will always be a time when kids are sleeping or occupied. For me that was first thing in the morning. Windows will change as kids sleep schedules change but there will almost always be one. I put aside dishes/laundry/meals and prioritized self. By doing that, I had energy to get all the stuff done my family needed.
2. I got to bed on time. Revenge bedtime procrastination isn’t worth it.
3. I asked for help with home responsibilities- whether it be a babysitter, partner, family or friend - I asked for help when I needed it. 

I don’t mean to sound preachy, but this is the most crucial step. I would have never gotten back in shape if didn’t make time for it. 

Training:
Before starting any exercise program postpartum get cleared by your Dr., see a pelvic Physio (common where I live) and check in with any other health issues. Postpartum depression is one that gets a lot of us. I had it with my first son and until that was resolved I couldn’t do much.

I was clear of all three so as soon as my stitches healed I did The Bloom Method’s 6 Week Core Recovery Series. 

After that I started walking everyday and doing kettlebell/HIIT workouts 3-4 times per week. I did this until September. I didn’t have a strict program but I did Turkish Get-Ups, push-ups, squats, single leg deadlifts, Bulgarian split squats, single leg hip thrusts, and Tricep dips a lot. I also did the Blogilates ab videos. My goal was to be able to do 10 push-ups so that I could move on. 

Once I got 10 push-ups I started doing TRX workouts 3-4 times per week. I did a variety of YouTube ones. At this point my goal was to do 3 sets of 12 supported pull-ups, and 3 sets of 12 rows with the strap at the medium length. Basically you sit facing the wall, strap in each hand, feet planted on the ground. You make a 90 degree angle from feet to knees to hips and pull yourself up with a bit of help from your legs. The rows are excellent to build strength too.

After these benchmarks were completed I read various guides on this forum. The mod u/Stephnelbow has a great one. I also DM’d her and she was really helpful. I read quite a few guides/posts and looked for the similarities. To me the similarities were that your primary efforts should be on the bar with hangs and negatives. This video from Dana Linn Bailey shows a really good progression. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iexsuX18mnc. This is the best video I’ve found. 

I followed this progression but I couldn’t get the half-pulls. I used a 5lb -15 lbs band instead. I could do 3x3. I also did 3 personal training sessions at my local CrossFit. I actually got my pull-up at my last session. The coach there showed me some banded exercises to incorporate - single-arm seated pull downs, banded lat pull-downs, rear delt pull-aparts, slow eccentric push-ups. I started doing 50 push-ups as a finisher and that built a lot of strength. I can now do 22. 

Nutrition:

I do IE. I won’t say much as to Steps 1-8, but step nine is the nutrition step. I tried to eat over 100 g of protein every day. My go to’s are eggs, chickpeas, beans, Skyr, meat, and Vega Protein powder, hemp and chia. Due to nursing I always eat when I feel hungry, but I stop when I’m full. 

… 

I feel awesome, I look awesome (hi abs, hi lats), and I’m an awesome mom too. By prioritizing fitness and working towards this particular goal I am in the best shape of my life. I’m so proud of myself getting my chin over the bar.",2022-03-19 21:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/ti4r9e/postpartum_to_pull_up_a_reflection/
rul3oa,xxfitness,SBS Hypertrophy Review: A Squat-Less Bastardization,"**Overview**:

hey everyone! decided to attempt a (greatly modified version of a) 21 week program for the first time! this program aka SBS hypertrophy would be a part of /r/weightroom 's [2022 program party](https://old.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qtcs2x/program_party_announcement_sbs_20/) that's going to start soon and you can also purchase it [here](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/program-bundle/). the program is written by based /u/gnuckols and comes in the form of a phat google drive folder with several google sheets inside and a PDF file to walk you through them.

i really have enjoyed Greg Nuckols' programs [in the past](https://old.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/l2yt8q/miniprogram_review_greg_nuckols_intermediate/) and wanted to challenge myself to do a longer program. in the past i've done 4 and 8 week programs but have never done a full 21 week one. previously, i had done multiple cycles (about 6 month's worth) of linear strength programs. it was time to switch things up.

**Physique**:

this past august i actually went to a warm climate for a bit and experienced what i looked like in lighter/less clothing after a dreamer bulk... and it wasn't great. i had noticed that on my camping/hiking trip this past May that i was constantly feeling winded and that the hot weather felt even worse with all of the extra lbs. 

while i was psyched to hit a 1pl8 bench, i constantly felt uncomfy with the amount of weight on my frame. i decided to run a hypertrophy program for the first time in a WHILE. i was definitely unconditioned and this kicked my ass the first few weeks. that being said, i'm quite happy now where i am with my physique currently. i'm still visiting family and my dad is an exquisite cook (as i write this my dad just handed me a piece of dinner tonight to try, fuck yes) so i'm essentially on a maintenance/light bulk phase right now. oh well!

that being said, i still am looking to lose quite a bit more weight, but **not cutting at more than 1% of body weight per week has made a huge difference in my physique *and* strength.** in the past i have cut down to as low as 120 lbs in the quest for good arm definition... and you know what? it wasn't there! i had cut too aggressively and fucked up my muscle gains. i'm constantly tempted to make choices to see that lower number on the scale faster, but then i remember that my physique and my lifts will suffer for it. also, i like beer (and bourbon).

**Programming**:

**a) Set-up/Accessory work**

without giving too much away, this program has three 7 weeks blocks with periodization. **i did the 3x a week version without any squatting movements**. unfortunately, when i first started to lift as a part of my d3 college swim team i learned some bad habits which has ultimately resulted in my hurting my hips to the point where squats are extremely uncomfortable/painful. i am still waiting on a referral to an ortho from my PCP, but to be honest i hate squatting anyway so i'm in no rush lol.

the program has you use 90% of your 1RM for your TM and notably does not ask for your DL max but your block pull max. i believe the reasoning here is that you can train DL movements without as much fatigue by utilizing auxiliary movements more frequently without taxing yourself too much. **whatever it is, it worked for me.** bench and squat has you pick two auxiliary movements while you only pick one for block pulls and OHP. 

(small aside: didn't have blocks so i actually did rack pulls instead.)

its recommended that you pick a back exercise as an accessory for every day that you lift. i kept it simple and did DB rows (unilaterally) three times a week. as for my other accessories, i did a combination of abs, shoulder rehab (former swimmer), curls, and tricep work (weak points). i did not try to do any linear progression with my accessories as i found them to be pretty consistently challenging as i would progress in my earlier compound lifts.

in my home gym, lifts would take from 45 mins to a little over an hour. workout duration began to drop as my conditioning got better throughout the program. that being said, i still don't superset anything with my compound movements and i didn't do any squat work so YMMV here.

i yolo tested my DL 1RM about 16 weeks in because it was feeling much stronger and it turned out i was right. after i tested it, i switched one of my DL accessories from RDLs to deficit deadlifts as i noticed my weakest point was getting it off the floor.

**b) Ye Olde Cut**

as i mentioned earlier in this write up, i did a relatively conservative cut on and off while running this program. here is a [very basic graph](https://imgur.com/a/cdsAIil) of my weight during most of this program (haven't had access to a scale in a bit but i weighed in around 160 lbs last week which is incredible given what my eating has been). please take note of how *not* linear it is. notably, one of the big spikes was after i ate soup broth all day after waking up super mega hungover. part way through, i started using macrofactor and will be saving my discussion of the app for a different post. however, i do really like using it.




X| August 2021| December 2021
---|---|----
**Weight**| ~183 lbs | 159.8 lbs
**Deadlift** (no straps) | 177 lbs | 200 lbs
**DB Bench** | 1RM: 45 lb DBs | 3RM: 50 lb DBs
**Height** | 5'2"" | 5'2"" lol
**Age**| 28 | 29

i didn't test my other compound lifts, because frankly the facility i'm using right now sucks. that being said, as this sampling of numbers indicates, despite being on a cut i gained strength. just to repeat here, cutting slowly works--at least for me. i've seen plenty of people report that hypertrophy in a cut is terrible and i went in expecting the worst. 

my cutting calories range from 1500-1700 calories per day. this was generally very doable as i work from home and can make myself delicious coffee throughout the day while i worked. if i felt like i was getting hungry i would throw some frozen costco stir fry veggies on a cast iron skillet with a little salt and pepper and go to town. i occasionally got takeout that i didn't even bother trying to take about 2-3 times a month with my gf for date night. i weighed myself every morning before food and water after using the bathroom to try and get the most consistent numbers for data entry.

normally, i would put progress pictures here, but i stopped taking them about a week before halloween. i just kept forgetting to take them. whoops!

**c) What I Liked**

if you've seen my username pop up on this sub before you might think that i'm getting a cut of the SBS proceeds or something, as i constantly find myself recommending SBS. i just really like the programming. that's it!

i liked the emphasis on back work here as it is a major weak point for me. this program also incorporated OHP which i had not trained in quite some time. looking at my program notes on my google sheet, i don't see a single workout where i missed the rep goal by a significant amount in the whole 21ish weeks i trained. the only time fatigue seemed to impact my training wasn't necessarily from training factors directly, but outside ones like traveling (e.g. redeyes). 

typically there were 4 work sets for a main movement with the 4th one having a separate ""rep out target"". while i understand that RPE/RIR has great utility for advanced lifters, i actually really appreciated the fact that this program does not rely on it. the truth is that i tend to get in my head too much during my lifts and i tend to underestimate the number of reps i can actually complete. when i'm just told what i'm expected to do that works for me because i'm not as likely to second guess my ability to do it. 

essentially, i feel that at this point, relying on RPE would keep me from performing at my absolute most because i would accidentally hold too much back when things got slightly uncomfortable during a set. shooting for a number is simpler and easier for me and i'll keep that up for as long as i can.

**Looking Forward:**

i am joining the r/weightroom SBS program party that i believe starts next week. i will be attempting the SBS reps to failure (RTF) program and am looking forward to it. i will be continuing to slow cut and am hoping to be around 145 lbs by May 1, 2022. after that, i will be looking to return to mostly more strength focused training. i'm hoping to hit a 225 deadlift while being under 60 kgs by the end of 2022 while retaining strength on my bench and hopefully getting my OHP numbers up a bit too. 

i think a lot of my goal-setting is going to revolve around my physique in 2022 and i'm already looking different/better at these weights than i did last time i did a cut, so i'm having trouble picking a specific ""number"" for a weight to *finish* my cut @. my intermediate cut goal will be 145 lbs and then i will likely do a quick diet break for about 2 weeks and then try to see what i look like at 130-135 lbs.

i'm really encouraged by how my strength has progressed despite being on a cut. despite the fact that i've been lifting for quite a few years now, i think i can chalk my progress up to the fact that: 1) i have a stable job now, 2) i'm no longer in grad school, and 3) i'm not lifting in as large as possible deficit. also, it certainly doesn't hurt that i have a home gym.

despite how long and meandering this post is, i'm sure i missed discussing something important so keep an eye out for edits :)

please feel free to ask me any questions, although i can't really comment/give insight on the squatting part which is certainly a significant portion of this program. also would love to read any write ups about your experiences doing SBS programs (especially this one and RTF).",2022-01-02 22:21:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/rul3oa/sbs_hypertrophy_review_a_squatless_bastardization/

### Training

 I used Hal Higdon's Novice 2 for Half Marathon Training. I chose the option with more mileage and less speedwork. This was the longest distance I've ever run so my focus was making sure I could complete. Most of my training was road running but I tried to make sure at least my long weekend run was a trail run. 

At the very beginning of the plan my first week was actually indoor stationary bike rides as I'd hurt my knee a bit. Toward the end I dropped one long run and I dropped a 4-mile run right before the race due to life getting in the way. I did SBTD the home version 4x per week as well and only dropped some of that this week leading into the race. 


### Pre-race 

This race was in Colorado in December, and we only ever got our first snow the day BEFORE the race. I hadn't gotten to practice what I would wear for chillier weather or layering. I did my Lulu winter running tights which unfortunately lack a phone pocket, long-sleeve run top, running jacket and light puffer jacket over. I also had gloves and an ear muff. 

Unfortunately the whole week leading up to the race my sleep kind of sucked. I have a good sleep routine, but the SO and I have cats that we are struggling to integrate since moving in together. The night before the race I apparently stole all the blankets off the bed and my SO just got up and didn't wake me because he wanted me to be able to sleep.#truelove 

Pre-race the organizers had put on an email and stated they didn't think microspikes would be necessary so I went with that. The race was at a state park and to keep parking open for other park users racers were to meet at a park and ride and then there were volunteers shuttling us to and from. 

I ate my standard pre-long run everything bagel with cream cheese that morning at about 5 a.m. I drank some liquid IV in my car on the drive to the race pickup. I had never done a long run like this and didn't understand what drop bags were so unfortunately didn't pack one. I figured since I wasn't allowed to have my car right there I just needed to seriously pare down and only bring with me what I was comfortable running with, lol. Thankfully this worked out fine. 


### Race

 And we go! The race organizers asked runners to only wear one headphone. I fairly quickly lost the one airpod I had in. It was at the start so tons of racers near me and a white airpod in the snow... I spent maybe a minute briefly glancing around then gave up. 

It was COLD. I was glad I had decided to layer on the puffer last-minute even though it wasn't a nice well-fitted racing jacket. The first 2-3 miles was quite the pack of runners jostling around. After that it evened out and became more typical trail running. Quiet. Nature. Just you & the elements. I would pass people occasionally or they would pass me. 

During my training I had practiced making myself pause every 15-30 minutes for a few quick sips of water. ... The hose to my hydration pack was frozen. Shit. So I just kept running. Thankfully it was cold so not as much sweat as the heat may have caused. And there was an aid station at 8 miles. 

Those first 8 miles of the race were pretty great. I felt good even when heading uphill and when it hit those few miles that were downhill before the aid station I let myself fly. Running downhill is the whole reason I like trail running, lol. Due to the snow I did have to slow myself a little due to increased risk of wiping out. 

At the aid station I paused a bit, had a quick cup of electrolyte water, had a few cookies, a handful of goldfish and a Base bar and headed back out. I didn't have a solution for my water issues so I just... kept going. 

The second half kicked my ass. I did see a couple beautiful deer as I got going again. The uphill on the second loop was absolutely brutal. I had a much harder time pushing myself versus the first uphill. And I think in a typical race all these people whizzing by you pushes you to run harder, but instead what I was seeing was other runners... really fit dudes... walking and my brain was like, ""yea! if these really fit guys can walk it so can you!"" haha. 

Around mile 10 I was really wishing I had water. My legs were dying. I could feel it in my hips a lot. Picked it up and ""ran"" the last couple of miles. They were my lovely downhills again but some was wayyyy too slick to have speed and unlike the first half I was just so knackered.... there was no joyful flying down. 

There was just a steady mantra of ""you're so close. Keep going. Just a little further. Water soon.""


### Post-race

I MADE IT. And I made my goal of under four hours. I got my medal, picked up my [swag](https://imgur.com/a/zk1Asz1). I was really pleased with the swag! I haven't raced much as fitness in general is pretty new to me. 

Previously I've done a road 5k (medal and tshirt), a road Turkey Trot 4-mile (t-shirt) and in September I did a 9-mile trail run put on by a local park (socks, lol). 

At this event we got a medal, which is a super cool looking wood piece that will work well as a tree ornament! Standard t-shirt. A buff, a super cute mug (v v excited for this mug!), a water bottle, a couple stickers and a cool fabric bracelet (it says ""I move mountains""). 

They had coffee, hot cocoa, water, people making quesadilla's and pancakes. There was an assortment of cookies, fruit, pretzels, m&ms and other snacks. I kept myself walking around for a bit and had some much-needed water (thankgod for the liquid IV I drank in the car pre-race!). 

I had a quesadilla and some m&ms. The organizers had strongly discouraged spectators due to parking and wanting to share the park. I'm not good at that whole ""talk to people you don't know"" thing, plus since I hadn't understood how drop bags work I didn't have socks to change into or anything there. 

As I finished at about noon it had finally warmed up, lol. It felt nice to ditch my puffer. My SO had been ""watching"" my race via my garmin live track feature and texted me a congratulations. Then I caught a ride back to my car and headed home!


### Random Thoughts

 I really liked the race! I like trail running. Road running is just... necessary. I liked the smaller, more community feel of this vs. big events. They were also very informative with pre-race info and the trail was very well marked.

 These run organizers really focus mostly on ultras (this race had an 8-mile, 16-mile and a 50k) and I'm not so sure if I'm up for an ultra, but we'll see how I feel after taking a break for a bit. I may try volunteering at one of their races too, as I think that could be fun.

qoesx7,xxfitness,Is there a health/fitness habit/exercise that you just know will never be part of your routine?,"Whether it's through trying them or just via the concept, what are some things that others recommend that might be very productive but you are just certain will never become something you can practice long-term?

Some for me - 

**Exercise-related:**

\- **Yoga.** I know people swear by it and I'm happy for them, but I've tried so many different styles of yoga with so many different instructors and it just doesn't do it for me. I'll maybe do a pilates sessions because I really feel like I'm pushing myself (rather than just feeling unflexible when I struggle in yoga), but I just don't see where yoga could be something I'd get into.

\- **Boutique classes**. It's just not in my budget and I'm so happy just lifting at any ol' gym that I can't see a reason for me to splurge on that

\- **Working out with a partner.** For me the gym is my time to be alone and in my head and listen to a podcast or music and not be bothered. Everytime I've gone to the gym with a friend it's super awkward trying to find exercises that work for both of us, and it's so much more inefficient. I'd rather just go the gym alone and then get coffee with that person afterward. 

\- **Barbell front squats.** Tried it for the first time this week using Stronger By The Day and I just had no damn idea what to do even though I'd watched countless videos. I think I'll just goblet squat from here on out. 

**Diet related:**

\- **Cutting out alcohol entirely.** When I drink I never had more than two drinks in a night (due to some medications I'm on) so I never really get drunk or have bad effects after the night is over. I just doubt I'd be one of those people who'd see major differences by quitting cold turkey.

\- **Cutting out added sugar entirely.** Dear god everytime I think through what I would have to alter about my daily diet to cut out added sugar I get exhausted. Just in the morning I drink creamer in my coffee, and then jam, granola, and honey on my greek yogurt. Added sugar is evidently as much a part of my life as drinking water is. I'm just gonna have to live with that.

**Other:**

\- **Bret Contreras.** Sleazeball. And there's plenty of other people online who have written about the topics he covers. I have no reason to ever give him my clicks.

\- **Longsleeved tops or full-length leggings to work out in**. I get that the sets are super cute, but it doesn't matter how freezing cold it is outside, I will end up getting hot during my workout and don't want something preventing my pits or my knees from airing out. 

\- **Stopping looking at screens X amount of minutes before bed.** I love looking at my phone right before bed to watch a Youtube video or Tik Toks. I haven't noticed any sleep issues, and I've done it so much for so long I feel like my brain is already accustomed to dealing with the blue light before going to bed.",2021-11-07 02:05:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/qoesx7/is_there_a_healthfitness_habitexercise_that_you/

I am a dog walker and do hikes and long walks almost 5 days a week. This activity keeps me healthy but I haven't met my goals. I currently weigh 135, 5’5, 30yrs old. My goal is to lose fat and build muscle. Do I need to add cardio to my routine or just weights/resistance to see a difference if I get plenty of LISS during the week? If yes, how often should I do a version of weights/resistance a week? 

My diet is very clean aside from an occasional cocktail/beer and pizza or burrito on a weekend. Otherwise, I eat a lot of nuts, chicken, I'm nondairy most of the time, tons of fruit, veggies (not so great at these). I do have sugar-free Red Bull about 3x a week and a protein bar while I'm out in the field for work. My snacks at home are popcorn, pumpkin seeds, oatmeal, etc. With my crazy schedule, my eating times are sporadic.

pux4zq,xxfitness,There's a guy who sings opera at the gym.,"TLDR: There's a guy at my gym who sings opera so loudly throughout his entire workout and I (and everyone else) can hear him through our headphones. It is annoying af. Do I need to chill out or is this a valid complaint to bring to management? 

 I go to a pretty popular gym. I got a new job so I'm going to the gym at a different time than what I used to, working out between 5:45am-7:30am. 

When I'm at the gym before work, I have my head down trying to get all my lifts done in a specific amount of time. And all before I've had my first cup of coffee! 

So I have my headphones in listening to hip hop, warming up on the elliptical and I hear singing. It takes me a while to figure out where it's coming from but I see a guy waking on the treadmill looking at his phone, singing. Loudly... Like using his entire voice and lungs to fill the room. Not like singing to himself, not like humming in tune with his headphones.. He's singing like he's on stage at the opera.

He moves from the treadmill to the stretching area. Then to the weight area. Then to the machines. Then back to the cardio. 

I can hear him THROUGH MY HEADPHONES during my entire workout, no matter where he is in relation to me. I've been to the gym 3 times this week, and he was there all 3 times singing. 

I like my gym! It's cheap and close to my house. I don't want to work out in the evenings because that's when I get to hang with my spouse and family. 

Should I talk to management? Is this a valid complaint? It's annoying enough that it's becoming just another reason for me to skip my workout..",2021-09-25 01:44:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/pux4zq/theres_a_guy_who_sings_opera_at_the_gym/
pu1mcv,xxfitness,What changes did you make that benefited you most?,"For me, I used to always workout fasted. I went into strength training sessions on a cup of coffee and two scoops of preworkout, but when I decided to start eating real meals before my workouts I had not only progressed in my lifts, but I just felt better overall.

I’m curious as to what other changes people in this sub have made that helped them the most in their fitness journey. 

Perhaps you started following a structured program? Maybe you stopped following programs? Started lifting weights instead of doing cardio for hours? Started doing cardio instead of lifting weights? Or maybe you stopped focusing on losing weight, and instead on becoming stronger? 

Or maybe you scaled down your goals, started to prioritize sleep instead of pushing more than your body could handle? Maybe you started working out with other people instead of by yourself? Did you incorporate mobility into your routine? Or did you start training in the morning opposed to the afternoon?

pererl,xxfitness,"How I (F, 30s) transformed my body and feeling better than ever","Reddit has helped me a lot on my health and fitness journey since February 2021 and I figured I’ll share my experience in case it can also be helpful to somebody else.

Old me from before Feb: sedentary lifestyle, ate a lot of take out, 5’7 and wore 26/27 pants (I don’t want to focus on weight because that didn’t change much but my body shape did), always felt physically and mentally fatigued, no visible muscle tone, poor fitness level, mood wasn’t great, slow metabolism, and generally didn’t feel great.

Current me: feel great, a lot of energy, good mood most of the time, rarely sick, lean muscle tone, decent fitness level, high metabolism and more confident. Size 24/25 pants even though weight didn’t really change. 

Here is what I did and disclaimer just because it worked for me doesn’t mean I recommend this to everyone. Every body is a bit different so this is just sharing my experience in case it can be helpful to someone. 
(1) alcohol: stopped drinking solo, only in social settings now. I used to drink a glass of wine or two daily on my own.
(2) diet: i cook at home most days and my meals are always some form of salad combined with a protein usually fish or chicken. Rarely ate carbs at home except for two oatmeal cookies every morning with my coffee. I made sure to hit my protein and fiber goals daily. When I dine out I will generally eat whatever I feel like since it’s only 1-2 a week.
(3) exercise: body weight exercises for 20min 2/wk, moderate to intense cardio for 30min 3/wk (I switch between hiking, jogging, jump roping, and swimming), hold a plank as long as I can 5/wk (initially I could only sustain 45sec, now I dcan go 2min30sec+), play golf at least 5hrs/wk.

Tips that helped me stay on track:
- if I don’t buy it I won’t eat it
- even if it’s hard still commit to sticking with it for a month and then at that time I decide whether I want to incorporate it into my lifestyle indefinitely. There were things that after trying a month I decided was not for me and thats ok as I had given it a go.
- never starve or feel deprived of food. I always made sure I felt satisfied doesnt mean I have to feel super full but I didn’t starve, and if I had a strong craving I would just have a little bit of it rather than depriving myself.

What’s next for me? I’m maintaining my current diet and alcohol habits but want to expand my fitness routine into more weight training.

I did a lot of research about recomp and maintenance on this sub in the last few months as I transitioned out of my weight loss journey, and since your posts helped me so much I wanted to contribute here as I've been genuinely shocked by my results!

**TL;DR:** I lost about 20 pounds in quarantine (50+ pounds over the course of several years) and thanks to this sub, I've transitioned to a maintenance/body recomp process in recent months. I've always struggled with weight fluctuations and regaining, and the recomp strategies I learned here have helped so much, both physically and mentally.

**Current stats:**

1. Age: 26
2. Height: 5'11""
3. Current weight range: 149-151 lbs (started quarantine around 170)
4. Recomp time frame: I hit 150 for the first time in May and have stayed right around that weight since.

**Progress Pictures:**

These are largely from June to July since that's when I've noticed the most difference in muscle tone.

**Workout Routine**

I lost the first twenty pounds mostly by walking, so it was a pretty big change for my body to start lifting weights around late April/early May. I'm super loyal to Heather Robertson's Youtube videos. I started with full body HIIT workouts a few times a week and in June started doing almost exclusively her Strength Superset videos. I focus on legs/butt probably three times a week and do arms maaaaaybe twice. (Not a fan!)

In the last month I've started hitting abs in some way every day, often just a five minute video here and there between meetings. This obviously has made a huge difference! I also try to just crank out some deadbugs whenever I have a minute throughout the day– I have pretty bad anterior pelvic tilt and I've found that these really help with general core strength and lower back pain.

I also still walk almost every day and occasionally jog– I try to do about 3-4 miles, though some days I'll do more and some days I won't go out at all. (Damn spring rain!)

**Diet/Nutrition**

I was eating way too few calories in the first half of this year while I was trying to lose my last ten pounds, and I think it really hurt me in the long run. I got down to around 1300-1500 a day with significant activity, which in hindsight was just insane for someone as tall as me. I was so irritable and tired, sleeping like crap, and my metabolism reallyyyy suffered, which was part of why I kept eating so few– I was immediately regaining weight when I ate more! That's when I really started researching here and elsewhere about reverse dieting and upping my calories in a strategic way. Once I hit 150 in May, my goal weight, I started upping my calories by about 100 cal a week. (I wasn't super strict about this– I just started eating more!) I definitely gained a few pounds back at first, which was obviously frustrating, but it evened out after awhile. Mixing reverse dieting with a new lifting plan helped me focus more on inches/muscle gains and less on the scale. Now I eat around 2000 a day and I'm planning to continue to bump up that number since at my height and activity level my maintenance calories should still be higher.

**Protein is everything!**

I think the biggest key to my recomp success was upping my protein a TON. In May I started making sure I got over 100g a day, and ultimately got that number up to 150g (aka the 1g per 1lb weight rule) which is still my current goal. I posted about this in a thread the other day, but I actually get too much protein these days– I need to cut down, but I've fallen in love with all my super high protein meals!

**Favorite high protein, low calorie meals and foods:**

\- pesto eggs and/or egg whites: I got this off Tiktok, but basically you fry your eggs in pesto instead of oil. I've been doing egg whites in pesto on a low carb tortilla with turkey bacon for lunch. So good!

\- My fav breakfast is baked chocolate protein oats: half cup quick oats (this is important because i want the cakier texture as opposed to chunky oatmeal), one scoop chocolate protein powder (two if your scoops are smaller), one tsp cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp baking powder, cinnamon, and two stevia packets. Add water until it's a cake batter consistency then microwave for 1:30 or so depending on your microwave– basically until it looks like a moist chocolate cake in a bowl! Then I like to mix a tablespoon of PB2 with a bit of leftover Stevia, cinnamon, and water and spread it over as a sort of icing/sauce thing. The PB2 kind of bakes into the top as it cools down– I swear it's good! Mine comes out to around 350 calories depending on the size of my scoops that day.

\- Cottage cheese. My queen!

\- Protein shakes instead of coffee creamer (especially for iced coffees!)

\- Giant salads with frozen pre-cooked chicken breasts

\- Built Bars: best macros I've found and sooooo good in the fridge! 17g protein for 130 cal, come on! Try the Salted Caramel, Coconut, and Double Chocolate flavors.

**Other Tips/Takeaways**

Taking progress pictures has helped me so much– I use my Snapchat app as a kind of visual fitness diary, and I like to take pics just for myself after workouts, of my meals, views on my walks, etc! If I hadn't taken all these pictures I would genuinely have no idea how much my body has changed outside of the number on the scale.

I'm by no means done with this journey, or done failing and learning from my mistakes!  I'm going on vacation in a few weeks and I'm extremely stressed about letting myself go– what if I gain a bunch of weight and fall off the wagon and this is the best I ever look in my entire life? But I'm so grateful for this community and constant reminders that it's a lifestyle change; there's no end to the road! Teaching myself these new methods of maintaining and progressing has helped me so much mentally– hoping it helps some of you as well. If you got this far, thanks for reading!

nw89pm,xxfitness,How 6 months of rock climbing has changed my body,"&#x200B;

## Your history and goals

I've always focused on cardio as my exercise of choice. I lost interest in running in spring of 2020 and haven't run since. I ended up with falling in love with rock climbing and have been climbing ever since. 

My goal is to be able to do 10 consecutive pull-ups. I could do 1 prior to climbing consistently.

## Your before and after stats

**Before**  
Height - 5ft 2in / \~157cm   
Age - 29  
Weight - I was pretty depressed spring of 2020 and reached the lowest weight of my adult life of 112lbs/\~51kg.

**After**

Weight - 124lbs/56kg

## Diet

My diet isn't very strict. I don't measure or count anything. As a general rule I try to stick to under 1500 calories a day and I generally eat pretty clean.

No soda, coffee is black, my go-to dinner is grilled chicken and sweet potatoes w/zucchini. I do drink alcohol on the weekends.

## Routine

I climb indoor 3x a week. My climbing sessions are 2.5 hours. There is a lot of resting between climbs since you have to take turns belaying. When we are finished climbing, I head to the pull-up bar to do one set with as many reps as I can until I cannot do anymore.   


When I am not climbing, I rollerblade or go on walks. This totals about 2 hours a week.

## Measurable progress or achievements

I've gained 12lbs/5kg. This is the most I've ever weighed in my life! I struggled at first with this. I've always been told gaining weight is a bad thing. Society doesn't really talk about women gaining muscle weight. I had a mindset of 'you are working out consistently so you should be losing weight'.   


I am starting to get comfortable with my  body. Progress pics have helped me feel more comfortable.

  
I am up to 5 consecutive pull-ups!

## Going forward

I'm not really sure what my point is in posting this... I just wanted to share my experience with you all as I imagine I am not alone in feeling 'bad' about healthy weight gain. I hope to get to 10 pull-ups by the end of this year :).",2021-06-09 22:33:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/nw89pm/how_6_months_of_rock_climbing_has_changed_my_body/
nkhqqk,xxfitness,2 months in and starting to see subtle progress!,"I'm a little over two months into regular strength training, and although the difference isn't hugely significant yet, it's still enough to make me tear up because I've waited SO long to get to this point where I'm actually taking care of myself and my body every day. I'm 20, 5'4"", and the last time I weighed myself I was 110lbs but probably weigh a bit more now.

[First picture is first starting out late March vs now, and second picture is weight gain since December.](https://imgur.com/a/alvCnqp)

I've struggled for years with getting myself to work out at all. On top of struggling with depression, I was in a toxic relationship for over two years that I finally left in October. I had no incentive to work on myself because I didn't love myself at all. I'm healing and trying to build my self-esteem, and after starting an antidepressant that has literally changed my life, I've been able to go to the gym at least 4-5 times a week for the past couple of months. And it's something I actually look forward to every day now. Like I'm just addicted to the feeling I get whenever I up my weights. I know the changes are super subtle, but it's so significant for me to be able to see that I'm getting stronger after I felt weak in so many ways for so long.

My weight gain since the end of last year is definitely the most dramatic change for me. I'm actually eating enough now because I'm overall happy. I honestly hadn't been focusing on calorie surplus or protein as much as I should've until very recently, so it's nice to see that I've still gained a little bit of muscle despite only eating my TDEE and *definitely* not getting enough protein for a while. The fact that I'm actually focusing on the diet part now too means I know my progress over the next few months will be more dramatic. I generally prefer plant foods over animal products, so lately I've been forcing myself to eat and cook more meat, snack on mozzarella and cheddar because they're the only types of cheese I like, and basically eat my body weight in yogurt. I've also switched from getting iced coffee every morning to getting iced espresso in a venti cup and mixing it with a caramel Premier shake.

May 2021 - [One](https://imgur.com/cca9gCL), [two](https://imgur.com/7r2lnyK), [three](https://imgur.com/afDkjz5)

**Background:**  I had my second baby in 2019, and while I dropped a bunch of weight  immediately after birth, I slowly started gaining a lot of weight due to  1) stress eating because of sleep deprivation and wrangling 2 kids, and  2) not moving as much or making time for exercise (again, thanks sleep  deprivation!).  I've always been a pretty active person (was a huge  runner in my 20's), so being out of shape just felt unnatural.   Especially being short, NOTHING fit right, and I felt so uncomfortable  in my body.  The baby started sleeping in longer stretches 9 months  post-partum, and I finally mustered enough willpower and discipline to  start exercising and watching what I eat again.

**January --> June:**   No big secret, I cut my calories, ate healthier, and started working  out.  I love to cook, so I've always made sure that as a family, we eat  healthy and balanced meals (lots of vegetables, complex carbs, lean  protein) - but I cut out the cookies, the chips, the  it-took-me-an-hour-to-put-the-baby-down late night ice cream.  I started  with 1400 calories during the week because I wasn't very active, but I  had treat meals on the weekends, and estimate that I was probably eating  2400ish calories on Friday & Saturdays. For exercise, I started  with 10-15 minute basic Fitness Blender bodyweight videos 3 times a  week.  It was so frustrating that I had once run a marathon but now I  couldn't even do 30 seconds of lunges.  I could barely do one pushup.   But I didn't get here overnight, so I stuck with it.

**June --> December/January:**   By now, I had graduated to much more activity.  I live in a large  city, so I walk a lot - to get groceries, to the park, to and from  daycare (once it opened), etc.  Pandemic was in full-swing, I ordered a  bunch of dumbbells to up my strength training (3, 8, and eventually 12  lbs).  I did Chloe Ting for a hot second, but found her videos super  repetitive and I hated her click-baity influencer schtick.  I started  doing Heather Robertson and Nicole Pearce, and graduated to 30-40 minute  workouts.  And then I discovered Caroline Girvan, and I WAS SOLD.  I  love her focus on strength and power, and I started doing her videos  with the limited dumbbells that I have.  I also started running again (a  couple of miles a few times a week) and upped my calories to 1500-1600  during the week - but with treat meals still on Friday and Saturday  nights (usually around 2100-2500 cals).

I  also took a few breaks.  We did some short getaways, and while on  vacation, I didn't work out, ate croissants and drank full fat lattes,  ate burgers and fries for dinner, had ice cream with the kids, etc.   Obviously, I ate like a mad person who had never seen food before around  the holidays

**January:**   I hit a wall, physically and mentally, in January.  I was around 116,  and I was panicking in a coffee shop because they didn't have almond  milk, and I knew soy milk would put me over my calories for the day.  So  I said, fuck it, fuck the last few vanity pounds.  I was the fittest  I've ever been, and in addition to strength work and doing Caroline's  Epic II program, I was trying to increase my miles because I love to  run.  So I stopped tracking calories, ate when I was hungry, and just  tried to prioritize whole foods over anything else. But there were days I  ate leftover cake at 10am and felt no guilt about it.  I was trying to  think of fueling my body like an athlete - with enough calories and food  to sustain my activity.  I probably ate around 1800-2000 most days.

**April --> now:**   After a few months at maintenance and focusing on performance over  weight loss, I was ready for another small cut.  My maintenance calories  are probably around 2100, so I cut down to 1600-1700 - again, with  treat meals and no limits on Friday and Saturday nights.  I started Epic  Heat, and average about 25-30 MPW running-wise.  I think properly  nourishing my body for a few months beforehand helped A LOT and I  started dropping the weight pretty quickly.  I started at about 114, and  weighed in at 110 (and change) this morning.

**The End:**   So that's it.  It took me almost a year and half to lose 30 pounds,  but that's how I roll.  110 was my aspirational goal weight - the weight  I was when I was in my 20's and marathon training.  Except now I have A  LOT more muscle mass from strength training, and am more ""toned"" than I  ever was when I was just running and doing cardio.  At 37, with 2  little kids, I'm in the best shape that I've ever been in my life.  I  did 99% of it at home (just recently started using the condo gym again  for access to heavier dumbbells), just watching my diet, prioritizing  protein and complex carbs, and trying to stay as active as possible.  I  feel like myself again - an even better version of myself - and I feel  like I have SO much energy to keep up with my kids and race them down  the street.

**What's Next:**   I'm going to stop tracking calories, and go back to eating more and  eating intuitively.  I'm chipping away slowly at my running pace, I'd  like to gain more upper body strength and be able to do more pull-ups.   It's getting warmer, which means I'll be spending more time on the lake  kayaking and paddleboarding.  While I started out initially just wanting  to lose weight, my goal really is not for people to look at me and  think, *She's so small/skinny* but rather, *GODDAMN she looks like an athlete* so I'd like to recomp and build more muscle.  And eat ALL THE THINGS.

mo82eb,xxfitness,Hit my weight loss goal! Now it's time to get serious about fitness - can you help me with my plan?,"Hola ladies. For reference, I'm 5'7 & 31 years old.

I went from 165 to to 132.5 in a little over 5 months - about 20% of my body weight. Hurray! I did it by cutting out fast food / greasy food, drinking less, adding more veggies, & intermittent fasting. But basically no exercise at all. Not even walking daily. My job does not require a lot of movement. I'm completely sedentary, my average steps per day for the last month is under 4000, according to my phone.

I'm still not super happy with how I look, my strength level, and my endurance / stamina. Don't get me wrong, I've gone down 6 inches around my belly button, but I want to be FIT. So now it's time for phase 2.

I went and got a body scan. Turns out I still have 29% body fat, nearly in the overweight category for my age range. So that's awesome. (But hey, bone density and lean muscle mass are still pretty good, so that's a plus)

Like all of us, I have a million things wrong with me. I have been diagnosed with PCOS, insulin resistance, hypermobility and adhd. I also have had emergency gall bladder surgery, and had an emergency c section that had me knocked out for 12+ hours, and couldn't walk for several days. I had to go to physical therapy for my back a couple years ago because it literally hurt to stand up straight. My core is non-existent, and a few different personal trainers have told me I'm completely front loaded, & possibly have dead butt syndrome. Whoo. I've been told to avoid yoga, running, and HIIT exercises - all super bad for hypermobility, apparently. 

SO. Please critique my plan:

Walking a minimum of 30 minutes a day, no matter what.
Body weight exercises 3 times per week - planks, modified push ups (when I can eventually do them, real ones) squats, lunges, glute bridges, and hanging from a pull up bar until eventually I can do a pull up. (Question, should I split these up, or can I do the same thing every time? I do better with routines)
Swimming 2-3 times per week (I have an indoor pool, so no excuses)
I have myfitness pal set to macros of 40% carbs, 35% protein, and 25% fat. (Is this good? With the insulin/pcos/no gall bladder issues, I believe I'm supposed to have lower carbs and fat.) And a calorie target of 1338 - but I'm ok going higher, as long as its the right foods. I started keeping track again and realized I was under 1000 most days, which is a big no no.
Switched out high gylcemic food for lower ones - sweet potatoes instead of rice, for example. 
I add collagen powder to my single cup of black coffee every day, take a multivitamin, and recently added whey protein+water as a snack once a day for a protein boost. I also take a multivitamin. Should I add creatine? My intracellular water is low, but extracellular water is right where it should be, which is good.
I only ever drink water (a lot of it) and 1 cup of black coffee per day. I will have a couple drinks on the weekend days, usually hard seltzer or vodka+soda.

What do you think? Should I add / change any exercises? I used to be a rock climbing instructor, but legitimately I was (lightly) sore after the assessment from just a few minutes of squats, leg lifts, modified push ups, etc. My goal is eventually to get to 21% body fat, but I trained once with a personal trainer a couple years ago, and was so sore I literally couldn't straighten my arms out, so I never went back. I don't want to get overwhelmed and just give up. Help!

Ps, this is incredibly long and I'm sorry.

EDIT: Someone pointed out that it sounds like myfitnesspal was set for weightloss instead of maintenance, and it was! I forgot to change it. Now it says 1880 calories.

mmvps4,xxfitness,Balancing Running with Lifting,"First off, I found the subreddit last week and have been loving the content and support in all the posts! 

I would love to hear some input or experience on balancing the best exercise for my mental health (running) with what’s probably better for my current body goals (lifting).

Running is my meditative activity. No activity clears my mind and balances my stress like going for a run (other than going for a hike). But I know my body goals right now, both for other performance goals and aesthetics, are best served by heavy weights.

I feel like there’s almost a demonization of cardio in some pockets of the fitness world right now - and I think it’s great to free people from feeling obligated from long hours of an activity they don’t enjoy. But I love running 5-6 days a week. It’s not about calorie burn, it’s about my sanity as the mom of a toddler with a full-time job.

I’m currently doing the LFS 5-day split and upping my protein significantly (side note - wow, 1.2 grams of protein per pound is like a whole lifestyle commitment). I run after the weight workout four nights a week and have been prioritizing more short HIIT type runs, but I really look forward to a longer run (6-8 miles) on Saturday or Sunday morning because it’s my chance to run outside in the sunshine and fresh air, and maybe enjoy a long cool down walk that includes a coffee shop.

My body goals are probably loosely defined as wanting to recomp or lean bulk, so I know that lots of cardio isn’t ideal, but the thought of losing the mental benefits I get from running make me twitch.

Do I grit my teeth and cut out long runs for a bit or just accept that progress is going to be much slower on any gains?",2021-04-08 16:37:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/mmvps4/balancing_running_with_lifting/
mmr8y6,xxfitness,Back from a Bad Break: Review of Deep Water Beginner Program,"**Intro**

(F) 5’7” 179lbs. I haven’t seen many reviews by women on Jon Andersen’s [Deep Water Method](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/#Barbell_Compound_Lift_Focused_Routines) over in the fitness wiki. I injured myself in January, and after I was cleared by my doctor, I ran this program to recover my strength and build my confidence back up.

TLDR:  program kicked my ass, I liked changing up the progression scheme from increasing weight to reducing rest time, and I’m back to where I was pre-injury. 

**Background**

Sedentary office worker checking in. Five years ago, I started concentrating on powerlifting, but have been off and on with exercise in general, trying to balance work and a new relationship. During pandemic, I did no strength training until September when I built my home gym. I ran the Beginner 5/3/1 program, followed by nSuns 4 day. Squat/Bench/Deadlift actual maxes at the start on 2021 were 190lb/145lb/240lb, all for 2 reps. OHP was 90lb for 3.  

Unfortunately, in early January, I slipped on my carpeted(!) stairs, carrying a bowl of cereal, and ended up in the ER with two fractures and a sliced-up pinky.  Luckily (if you can get lucky in the context of breaking your body on some stupid stairs), it was mostly just painful and scary, nothing long term.  By mid-Feb, my doctor cleared me to resume my normal activities, including lifting, but to avoid contact sports and falling down more stairs.

**Program**

Generally, Deep Water (DW) is a 6-week, 5 consecutive day program. You can get a free copy of the e-book by giving your email on [Jon Andersen’s website](https://www.deepwatermethod.com/free/ ) or it’s available for $10 off Amazon. (Note he also offers a 3-month DW weight training method for $180, which is different). 

For the Beginner program, Days 1 and 3 are 10 sets of 10 reps of either squat or deadlift, and 10x10 of OHP or push press. Days 2 and 4 are 3x10 of back exercises including cleans and AMRAP pull-ups, and 3x10 of bench variations and AMRAP push-ups and dips. Day 5 is 20 minutes of conditioning. The lifting days also include core exercises of sit-ups, 1min planks and/or back extensions. Weight is set at 54% of your tested max. 

DW Beginner progresses by reducing rest times. You start with a max of 4 minutes of rest between sets, and every two weeks, reduce the rest time by a minute.

**Goals**

I’ve wanted run DW for a while based on the reviews on r/fitness and r/weightroom. I wimp out on AMRAPs and was hoping to build  up my stamina when lifting.

Post-injury, I wanted to recover my strength and my confidence in putting heavy loads on my back after spending the start of 2021 feeling weak and helpless and freaking out over every minor twitch. I also hoped to return to my previous maxes, but that was a secondary goal.

**Modifications**

I switched to bench dips, and pull-ups immediately followed by bench assisted pull-ups for more volume. I braced against a barbell for back extensions since I don’t have a machine. I also switched the sit-ups to Russian twists after I tweaked my neck the first week. 

For personal preference reasons, I did the 10x10 deadlifts with a trap bar, and all OHP and push press with an axle bar. 

Conditioning was mostly running up and down a hill or a HIIT spin class. 

I actually emailed Jon Andersen some questions about my modifications, and to my surprise, he wrote back. Since I’ve never had clean pulls in my programming before, I was initially considering using a lower weight and relying on my lighter axle bar. He pointed out that I would probably be inhabited my grip and wouldn’t get the full benefit of the exercise. So I sucked it up and used a regular barbell, then surprised myself by going up to 95lb. 

Finally, I really tried to keep to the 5-consecutive-day format but had a couple of weeks with an unintentional rest day midweek due to work. I also made first day of my period a rest day. 

**Diet**

Y’all, this program made me eat. I went from drinking coffee only in the morning to waking up hungry. Breakfasted consistently for the first time in my life, ignored any sort of calorie restriction, and actually tried to meet my protein goals for once (aimed for 130-140g/day). Weight fluctuated up and down but generally is back to where it was pre injury.  

The recommended diet in the ebook is five meals a day of high quality, organic protein, fats and leafy greens (Jon Andersen is anti-carb, safe to say). I initially wasn’t going to make any dietary changes, but since the program aims to remove easy recovery methods like carbs and rest days to challenge yourself further, I gave up my regular quick carbs like cereal and chips, and tried not to eat before or during the workout. However, fruits and beans were still a regular part of my diet, and I occasionally ate bread and sugar. 

I also drank but had some success dialing that down by switching to Athletic Brewing NA beers. Many thanks to this sub for that recommendation.

**Farts**

They were bad.

**Physique**

I purposefully did not take progress photos because I wanted to focus on recovery (Sorry to disappoint—those are my favorite parts of progress write ups). However, my SO started calling me to [Geodude](https://imgur.com/a/Lv2QOSO), so I guess you could say I reached peak physique with this program.  

**Experience**

I went from 4 minutes of rest between each set to 2 minutes of rest for:

+10x10 back squats: 100lb

+10x10 trap bar deadlifts: 165lbs

+10x10 OHP: 60lbs

+10x10 Push Press: 80lbs

+3x10 Clean Pulls: 95lbs

+3x10 Bench Press: 95lbs 

I’m now a week into running nSuns again, and I’m back to where I was in January. (To be clear, I am not suggesting this program “healed” me, just that it allowed me to regain my confidence in putting heavy loads on my back).

More importantly, the program kicked my ass, and I had a great time running it. Most days, I ended each session feeling spent, HR in the cardio zone, and like I could not do another rep with a knife to my belly. Reps weren’t always pretty but the program really teaches you to push while still in recovery. (Only failed twice and reracked once during a set when I smacked myself in the jaw on a push press. Honestly, the overhead pressing was consistently an asshole to me the entire program, but I have now gone from 90lbs for 3 to 95lbs for 3). By the 5th week, I had mostly forgotten that I had this back injury, and I feel prepared to tackle whatever is next.

Before this, if I had to design my nightmare program, it would probably include high rep squats at warm up weight, mandatory conditioning, planks and only benching once a week. Certainly, two weeks in, I was wondering why I decided to go from feeling bad from not moving and eating too much sugar to feeling bad from DOMS and overeating. But DOMS started to subside, I figured out how to eat less like a dumbass, and I was never bored (hard to feel bored when you are always slightly afraid of the next set). The 10x10 were so much easier on my joints than heavy reps, I loved how simple it was, and I certainly got better at pushing myself when the chance of failure is very real. 

My only change personally would be starting with a 60-65% estimate for the weight rather than 54%. I began with 54% of my January maxes (rather than the estimated max), assuming that being out of commission for 6 weeks would make those numbers safe. I went up in everything except squat, and I regret not increasing my squat—it’s the only lift that doesn’t feel as solid now at higher weights, and I think grinding at a higher weight would have helped. When I run this again, I will probably target what I feel comfortable doing for 3x10.

**Final Thoughts**

DW definitely targets men (email and ebook littered with talk like ‘this program will cause most men to break’, ‘don’t be a p****y’, that sort of thing. Email even addressed me as “my brother” 😂). But like the majority of lifting programs aimed at men it seems, DW is equal opportunity for anyone comfortable performing the movements. I ended up rereading the ebook a couple of times because the mental aspect of lifting isn’t something I’ve thought about a lot, and I appreciated learning about his thoughts and background. 

Really, I’m just pro any program that challenges my preconceived notions of what I like or can do. And to go from lying in bed, dependent on someone else for basic needs, to pressing 80lbs over my head 100 times is something I am very grateful for.",2021-04-08 13:00:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/mmr8y6/back_from_a_bad_break_review_of_deep_water/
lrl46o,xxfitness,Partner “trying to help” is actually screwing up my weight loss.,"EDIT: wrong word! 
Hey friends. 
So I’ve been trying to get healthier for the last year or so. I’m 29f. 
I’m currently 165cm and weigh roughly 97 kg. 
I have been working out 3-4x a week for around an hour per workout. 
I have lost around 25kg in the last 13months. 
My partner is 37m, 190cm and weighs about 105kg. 
He started out ignoring my attempts to get him to workout and eat better. Then he decided around month 6 of my journey to join in. He lost 15kg or so. Once he hit >100kg he stopped doing either of those things. 


In early November we moved house. Our eating took a marked decline into the junk range and my weight has pretty much been plateaued since November when previous to that I had been losing approximately 2kg a month. I had used a bmr calculator to figure out my daily calorie allowance with a deficit (around 1600 which is a 400 deficit from the recommendation of 2000 ish for maintenance). 


Now, I’m new to this fitness stuff, and had always heard that you SHOULD NEVER eat your exercise calories. From the very beginning, my partner was saying that I “haven’t been eating enough” and “you’re starving yourself” and “your deficit should only be 500”. 


For those of you wondering I have a MyFitnessPal account that is set so friends can see my calories and food consumed, and a Garmin wearable with the same settings. My partner is one of those friends. I initially added him to keep myself accountable re snacking etc. 
Now, I am RARELY hungry in the mornings and would have a few cups of coffee with milk and sugar, and that normally does me until lunch time so I thought “screw it, I’ll do IF with the fasting being between 10pm and noon (except for coffee). 


My partner said “you have to eat breakfast or your body will go into starvation mode!” So I started having some Greek yoghurt and granola or a single slice of toast with light cream cheese and cucumber for breakfast. 
In addition, back in October I had engaged a personal trainer. Previous to this I had been playing RingFit and doing cardio videos from YouTube. 
The PT and I had two sessions a week, for six weeks, during which I’d burn around 600-800 calories/session. 


I wasn’t at that point, going over my calories too much and was also struggling to HIT 1600/day. So mostly I was fine with +/-100 calories (total). 
My partner would say that my deficit was too high (bc he could see it on garmin) and would get grumpy and I would have a small snack (apple and a piece of cheese for example). 


He would say that the “calories in calories out” number in garmin needed to be under 500. 
So even though I had been losing around 2kg a month doing what I was doing, I started following that advice. Since November I have actually overall, gained around 0.2kg. 
Some other issues I’m faced with are: 
1: he constantly buys and eats snacks. Like unhealthy ones (fudge, crisps, beer, cider(my particular kryptonite) and there is always junk food in the house. 
2: on several occasions I’ve had to tell him multiple times that “No, I don’t want potatoes” “no I don’t want rice” and this has actually resulted in several arguments. 
3: he always cooks high calorie, high fat meals for dinner when it’s his turn to cook, to the point that I have taken to having lighter lunches and no breakfast on the days he cooks dinner. 


Now, he and I have the same “goal weight” of 80kg (yes I know that’s still too high for me to be ideal but it was more that the idea of HALVING my weight when I started out seemed insurmountable), and he has, since November, regained around 6kg. 
I have suggested that we work out together (I mostly do HIIT and strength stuff with dumbbells and 2x cardio boxing) and he has always declined because “he prefers cycling” which is not something I enjoy. 


I have suggested that we eat more salads/vegetables or that we could eat separate dinners simultaneously (because he thinks filled pasta with grated cheese and butter on it is a “simple light dinner”. Uhm. No? That’s like 800cal), but “we need to eat dinner together!” and I don’t really want to cook every meal to be honest. I’m not his mom. 
I am just ridiculously frustrated with all of this and am wondering what I can do to fix it (both my plateau, and how my partner keeps “trying to help”). How do YOU deal with family members who “try to help”?",2021-02-24 19:24:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/lrl46o/partner_trying_to_help_is_actually_screwing_up_my/
lodzwm,xxfitness,Trying to plan Macros and honestly frustrated,"Hi everyone!

I've gained a bit of weight during COVID-19 and have fell off the bandwagon on fitness over the past year. This month, I've made it a priority to get back to my goals and realised that I actually don't eat enough calories during the day (under 1200 for sure) which in turn can cause me to overindulge sporadically throughout the week (not every day, but maybe more so like 3x a week).

That said, I decided to start counting my macros to help amp this up. I'm pretty active and lift weights 3x a week, + yoga/HIIT in between and am starting to walk about 5KM daily on top of that. I've plugged in sample meals to MFP to try to make sure I can follow the breakout of 40P/30C/30F and am aiming for 2,211 calories but I can never make the full amount plus I can't get it to balance.

The main issue I have is that I'm deathly allergic to a lot of snacks that could help me reach those goals - all tree nuts, soy, and wheat. I also can't have dairy because of my autoimmune issues and medications I'm on for those. 

I'd love some feedback on a sample menu/get some tips from people who may have similar issues. I also worry with MFP it's not 100p accurate because it's also basically telling me eggs are ruining my diet. 

Breakfast:  
2 eggs, 1 tbsp shallots, 1 tbsp of guacamole, 1/2 cup of red pepper on a Caulipower Grain-free Tortilla Wrap, side 2 cups of kale, with 1 tbsp of olive oil.   
Est Cals: 446

Lunch:  
150g grilled chicken, 1 cup sweet potato, 2 cups Brussels sprouts w/ 1 tbsp of ACV and 1 tbsp of grainy mustard, sautéed w/ 1 tbsp of olive oil   
Est Cals: 448

Dinner:  
150 g salmon, 85g of asparagus, 2 cup of broccoli, 4 Kalamata olives  
Est Cals: 290

Snacks:  
ATP Supreme Beef Protein (30g), 2 cups black coffee, two Romaine wraps with 4 oz of steak, 1 tbsp of roasted garlic hummus  
Est Cals: 376

Total Daily Calories: 1,594  
Macro Breakout: 35P/26C/39F

I'm just frustrated. I don't even really like doing protein powder but feel like I'm just trying to achieve the perfect breakout so I can get back to what I feel is more normal. I guess my last question is am I overthinking this? I look at what I've mapped out and it seems pretty balanced.",2021-02-20 18:59:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/lodzwm/trying_to_plan_macros_and_honestly_frustrated/
l96mw4,xxfitness,Everything changed for me when I started using fitness to sculpt my mind rather than my body,"I recently had a huge mindset shift regarding my approach to fitness. 

So during quarantine I've gotten into running. I have been running consistently 3x a week since I was 11 years old, at my school that had a huge focus on trail running around our school in P.E. class. I took a break from running in the start of college, and got back into it last summer as a way to pass time. 

From age 11-18 when I would run, it would be to make a certain time to get credit for that assigned run in class. I was always one of the slowest runners in the back of the pack, and I got made fun of for that, along with the fact that I was a bit chubbier than my peers. As you can imagine, this just made me dread running, and I absolutely swore that once I graduated at age 18, I would NEVER run again.

Well, that didn't happen.

I began to run during summer, and soon found that it was a great way to blow off steam. During the lockdowns, I was stressed and sick of being in my room all day with nothing to do. When I was running, I felt free. 

But the best part of running for me? It's that when I lace up my shoes and start jogging, I'm able to conquer the memories of all the times I felt too slow, too lazy, too unfit to keep up with my classmates.

Running has given me a tool to overcome the voices of the bullies that I was never able to forget after all this time. I feel like I'm sculpting myself into who I want to be every time I run, rather than accepting the person other people told me I would be--because every time I finish a run, I know I'm making that little girl who got picked on for being slow so, so proud.

This mindset has taken me further in my running pursuits than any other flimsy desire for aesthetics that used to fuel me. What's more, since I'm so focused on doing better at my runs each morning, other things in my life have fallen into place. I'm sleeping and eating better, I'm meditating, and being spiritual again, because everything feels so interconnected, and I know that to achieve my best physically I need to be balanced in all aspects of my life.

I used to view running as a way to lose weight, or to punish myself for having eaten too much. I used to be ashamed of my speed or feel I wasn't a ""real runner."" 

Now I see running as a war with myself that I can win just by not stopping. There's no rules on my runs except ""DON'T STOP."" When I finish a run, it's a huge win, and every run I learn something new about myself. When I push my limits, I find out what I'm truly capable of, and that is such a profound process.

Now I am beginning to strength train as well, and I have never felt more empowered in my entire life. I feel like I'm a machine, and every day I'm putting in this effort to make myself better. I eat to run and train, I sleep to run and train. I take care of myself so I can perform. It feels like all the cogs are turning in harmony in my body, slowly getting more in-sync. 

I love seeing my muscles in my legs, I love feeling my core get solid from my ab workouts. I love looking in the mirror and seeing my tiny arm gains and being like THAT'S ME! I DID THAT!

I just wanted to make this post because a few years ago my self-esteem was so low, and I used to browse this subreddit and lurk on here with a subtle sense of jealousy and a large sense of awe at the women on here. I would wonder how you guys are so strong, and how you are so confident, and I would envy that mindset. 

Now I know that there's two ways to look at fitness:

1. Getting fit is a way for us to sculpt our bodies.
2. Getting fit takes mental effort that will sculpt your mind in such a meaningful way that makes your fit body a secondary achievement.

Thank you to everyone who posts on here and inspires everyone with your stories. I feel like I'm becoming the woman I always wanted to be. I'm so happy to have a place to share and relate to other strong women on here.

You guys are my soul sisters, and I love you all so much!!

l5mzew,xxfitness,What Is My Activity Level?,"Hi all,

So, over the last 3 years I've managed to transform my relationship with health and fitness and I have gotten to a point where, for the time being, I am pretty happy in maintaining my weight and physique.  
I'm attempting to eat at a 'maintenance' amount. So I'm just looking for what you would advise my activity level would be so I can know roughly what I should expect my TDEE.

I work as a Barista for a pretty busy coffee store, I own a horse which I tend to before and after work and I usually run in the evenings probably 4 times a week. This means that I am often on my feet for a vast majority of the day.  
I would have thought that would be classed as active?   
I've worn a fitness tracker before to try and get a reading on steps per day but unfortunately it was not very accurate at all when I attempted to track steps taken at work.

kzxnuz,xxfitness,WFH folks- when do you fit in workouts in your daily routine? Anyone without a set workout time still successful at working out consistently?,"I’m currently struggling hard with setting a routine when it comes to workout. I have a gym at home. Ive been trying to get up early but then find, I want to just have unproductive time, looking at online articles, making coffee, tea or a small bite. then I feel like i should use that morning alertness to do meaningful work from my job. By then Its time for my morning meetings and I feel super guilty and angry at myself for not working out. 

I’m now reflecting that maybe I should stop to have it be a set way everyday. And just take it as a blessing that I have a gym at home and be flexible and just try to fit it as I can. 

I also think that I’m a little burnout from my workout because I’m doing low reps heavy loads and it’s mentally taxing and takes me 1.5 hours. Maybe I should just do rowing sessions for now.

# Halloween (solo) Half Marathon

## Your background

I am 34 y/o (35th birthday is a few weeks away) and have a 3 year old and an 18 month old.  I've always been an athlete, but I enjoyed playing team sports and ""working out"" was always meant to improve my play.  I started running with a C25K program in February of this year to get some routine fitness back in my life and found out I really enjoyed the peace of running and also working my way through a program again.  After the C25K, I ran Hal Higdon's novice 10k program, then did a few weeks of his base building program before deciding to take the jump and train for a half marathon.  

## Training

I used [Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Half Marathon Training](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/) program.  This included running 4x a week with a long run on the weekend and a day of cross training.  I also did yoga 3-4x a week and did a short, supplemental strength routine I found in Runner's World twice a week for about half an hour.  Last week was a taper week and I went from running 13 miles during the week (not including the long run), to just 9, with the last run before my half being a short/easy 2 miles on Thursday. 

## Diet

I'm still breastfeeding, so my appetite went through the roof.  I didn't adhere to any sort of specific diet, but I made sure to eat when I was hungry and limited processed/fast food.  I did eat a TON of ice cream though...

The day before the half I focused on drinking TONS of water and ate until I was full, including a big ole' baked potato with dinner.  

## Performance

I felt really confident going into my run on Saturday.  My initial goal at the beginning of training was just to finish it without walking.  However, I had done every single training run as prescribed and I'm pretty competitive, so last week I set the goal to finish is 2:20 (10:30 min/mile).  Not a very aggressive time goal, but enough that it would keep me pushing throughout the run and gave me something to focus on.  Saturday morning was the coldest morning so far this fall, so I layered up and headed out with gatorade and 2 nutrigrain bars in my flipbelt.  I felt really good for all of the run and my knee, which had been bothering me the past two weeks, held up REALLY well. I was able to really push the last few miles. 

Splits:

|Mile 1|10:19|
|:-|:-|
|Mile 2|10:13|
|Mile 3|10:30|
|Mile 4|10:03|
|Mile 5|9:59|
|Mile 6|10:06|
|Mile 7|9:56|
|Mile 8|10:07|
|Mile 9|10:13|
|Mile 10|10:00|
|Mile 11|9:53|
|Mile12|9:40|
|Mile 13|9:02|
|Mile .13|1:01|

My time?  2:11:08! It felt so good to crush my initial goal.  I also hit some other PBs:

1 Mile: 8:50 (first sub 9 minute mile!)  
5K: 29:25  
10K: 1:00:48

## Thoughts and going forward

I slowly walked home on a bit of a high after achieving something I've worked toward since February.  It felt so good to find myself again through this process.  Motherhood changes you in very large, necessary ways and it is pretty disorienting.  I was able to use running as a way to remind myself that I can do hard things and that I'm still ME.  I walked into my house and was stunned to see a bunch of my family there with signs and hugs waiting to congratulate me.  My husband had got everyone together to help me celebrate my achievement in these weird times.  I was speechless.  My three year old ran up to me with a sign and gave me a hug and when I asked her if she knew why everyone was there she said no (hahahaha), but it was the best hug.  I also had a friend who was a virtual training buddy (she was training for a 10k).   Our group of friends cheered us on before/after and it was so nice to feel connected to them.  I ate a breakfast sandwich, drank some coffee and water and talked to my family before heading to my room for a nap. 

I'm not sure what's next.  I'm leaning towards using [Hal Higdon's Winter Training Program](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/more-training/winter-training/) as a rough guideline to keep up with running through the winter and focusing on improving my speed on my 10k in the spring and my half in the fall.  I do know I want to find a better/more challenging strength program.  This week I'm going to do some short, easy runs and lots of easy yoga.  

A HUGE thank you to the XXfitness community for all the support and guidance!  Being able to ask beginner questions and gain insight from more experienced runners was invaluable.",2020-11-02 14:32:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/jmofdu/first_half_marathon/
jkfggk,xxfitness,Alternative to cold smoothies? What do you do in the wintertime?,"I've been having a great year, nutrition-wise.  I feel like I've really found a successful way to plan my meals, eat all the delicious stuff I want while getting my protein and not overeating.  

My basic formula for success:  

Breakfast- Coffee + buttered multigrain-sourdough toast crusts I cut off of my daughter's toast.  

Lunch:  Smoothie with about 60g protein.

Dinner: Whatever I feel like.

As you can see, my lunch smoothie is a critical part of my plan.  It gets me most of my protein for the day, and allows me to eat a normal dinner to my liking without trying to cram more protein in.  

But the weather is quite cold now where I live, and I'm struggling with my protein shake.  The ""hot"" shake recipes I've tried, are just not delicious.  I would love your suggestions for a high protein lunch that's easy.

jaq403,xxfitness,Struggling with macros,"TLDR: Are my macros too small and how the f\*ck do I manage to eat 140g of protein in 4 meals a day when I used to only eat 2 meals a day?

I just started an 8 week nutritional plan with my Crossfit coach so I can build muscle. He suggested I have 100g of carbs on rest days (adding 50g to that on training days), 40g of fat, and 140g of protein. My biggest struggle has been with eating enough protein. I can def do it if I can rely on shakes to supplement, but he wants me to focus on getting it through 4 meals a day as much as possible.

I was king of intermittent fasting because I've never liked breakfast or traditional American breakfast foods (pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, etc). I figure if I'm not feeling hungry in the morning, it's ok to not eat. I've been having only coffee with coconut milk creamer and water for months now, then eating lunch around noon and dinner between 7-8pm. So bumping up my food intake to 4 meals a day sounds impossible.

I also get sick of the same foods very easily, so I'm already finding myself getting sick of egg whites even when I add things to it that I love, like kimchi. It's hard for me to work in other proteins like cashews or other nuts because of the fat ratio since I'm shooting for 15g per meal. I figured I would look for meal prepping inspiration, but several websites like Myfitnesspal and Eat This Much have said I'm not getting enough calories with my prescribed macros.

So my questions are:

* Are my macros too small?
* How have you successfully added protein to your diet without relying on the same sources or adding too much fat?

For reference, I'm a F37, 5'4"" (162cm) and 143lbs (64kg). I'm not interested in ""toning"", I want to build noticeable muscle mass now that I've started seeing some nice definition in my shoulders, biceps and quads.

\*\*Edit\*\* I'm recovering from a minor foot injury, basically swelling and tingling in the ball of my left foot (Metatarsalgia) from doing crossfit-like workouts and dancing barefoot. I was working out 3-6 days a week from about April - July and noticed the problem with my food by August. I'm doing whatever I can in the meantime to maintain/gain while I recover. I can stand at least, so a lot of DB exercises are on the table for me and seem intense enough without burpees and tuck jumps. My coach is aware of this too and ensured me I can still have good training days without being able to use my feet as much.

Thank you for the responses! I'm going to discuss my concerns and hopefully my coach can work with me to tweak my numbers.

**After discussion:**  
I  figured some of the disconnect. It was a bit confusing because he gave me  an actual protein number to shoot for, but the carbs and fat aren't the  whole story. It's kind of weird to explain, but the 100g of carbs are  only additional carbs from things like fruits and grains. I'm supposed  to eat a cup of vegetables with every meal, but none of veggie carbs get  counted against me if that makes sense. Likewise with fats, although I  can't think of a good example of fats I wouldn't count besides whatever  is in my lean protein. So my macros aren't really my macros? I think  it's a really confusing way to do it, because I assume I'm not the only  person who would look at the macros and interpret them at face value,  especially when one of the three is actually at face value lol.

He  didn't even want me to start counting carbs and fat yet at all until I  got my protein up more. He also said he doesn't normally show people all  3 macros at once because of the risk of confusion...which I think he  should still do because it definitely got me.

I  did try to tell him I think 140g is too much, but he did push back against that. Not sure what to do there. If it won't hurt me, I could  give it a try and drop it down once I'm not working with him anymore. He  agreed that tweaking carbs and fat down the line may be necessary, but  doesn't want me to worry about counting them yet, let alone adjusting  them. He said those numbers are just a baseline to start and we can see  how I feel once I try hitting them in a few weeks.

Hopefully that makes it better, but I don't think I'd hire him again for nutrition. ",2020-10-14 00:29:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/jaq403/struggling_with_macros/

I'm not cutting or eating for weight loss, so I don't think a calorie deficit is the cause but will experiment with adding more food just in case. 

Would love to hear your experiences with working out and sleep. Do you have a temporary adjustment period where you need extra sleep every time you increase your workout intensity? Do you just always need an extra hour when actively training? 

On the more logistical side: How do you make time for the extra sleep if you need it? Do you try to improve sleep hygiene/ quality in the same 8-hour window, or add extra hours? What's worked?

Thank you high school) I usually workout to blogilates but lately Ive found a hamilton workout that I plan on trying soon. 
I plan on going shopping later to pick up some things, so far im stuck between Quest and Pure Protein. Im also debating about getting Maine Roast Protein Coffee. I was curious if anyone had any ideas of which would be good? Also do I need a blender or can I just buy a shaker bottle and just shake the powder?",2020-09-02 06:29:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/il1ojz/protein_powder/
ij1i45,xxfitness,Pre and post workout nutrition questions. Do you change up what you eat based on whether you’re doing cardio or weights?,"Alright so I recently learnt that my old tactic of working out on an empty stomach first thing in the morning is NOT the way to go with weight training. 

I had no clue that you can’t build as much muscle if your body doesn’t have carb fuel for the workout. Oops, at least I know now. 

My question however is, I picked up the tactic when I was doing mostly cardio. Doing cardio after food drains me. I feel like I perform best when I go in on and empty stomach and after a coffee. 

So is it okay to skip breakfast on cardio days, and eat breakfast on weight days? 

Also, any pre and post workout food ideas?",2020-08-29 22:22:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/ij1i45/pre_and_post_workout_nutrition_questions_do_you/

gri2o5,xxfitness,6-week mini cut results,"I’ve been weightlifting for the better part of a decade but always had spurts of a a few weeks of consistency followed by months of being lazy. I’ve always had it in my mind that I wanted to be in super good shape for my 30th birthday, so when I realized it was coming up 6 weeks ago I started a short “summer shred” to see how lean I could get. My bday is on Tuesday so here are the results!

Stats: 5’ 3” (160 cm) 110lbs (50kg) 

Beginning weight was 112.4 so not even a 3lb difference. 

[Vids & Pics (NSFW)](https://imgur.com/a/YybhG8C)

**What I did**

**Routine –** Went from half-assing a modified version of Ice Cream Fitness on Tues, Thurs, Sat with NO cardio (I’m talkin’ none. Zip.) to an aesthetic split on MWF with running or jump rope/cardio interval training on Tues, Thurs, Sat, Sun with no missed workouts during the cut. I am VERY LUCKY and have an entire basement gym set up so the COVID gym closures didn’t affect me too much (although I did miss my gym for things like cables and getting tf out of the house)

**Nutrition –** For the past 8 or so years I’ve followed intermittent fasting (16/8 window) and IIFYM. For this cut I went on a slight deficit. **WARNING**: I am small and have a desk job, so besides my workouts I am on my butt all day until my Apple Watch yells at me to stand up. **These numbers reflect that.** 

My calories and macro split for this cut is 1299 cals 98P/43F/130C. This is only about a 250cal deficit from my maintenance, which is proven by my steady \~.5lb loss per week of the cut. I eat a lot of whole eggs, Greek yogurt, chicken breast, lean turkey, cheese, potatoes, whey protein powder, fruits and veg. Due to IIFYM I also have chocolate, rice krispie treats, or cosmic brownies every night depending on my mood and what fits haha. I haven’t gone over my calories in the entirety of the cut except on the day I donated blood where I upped my intake a bit to compensate. I don’t feel hungry, I feel fueled for my workouts, no fatigue.

**Other tidbits -** I completely cut out alcohol. I hate to say it but I think this was a MAJOR factor into the progress I made during the 6 weeks. I went from drinking a ton of beer and wine (and tequila, and whiskey, and… you get the point) to completely dry. I also upped my water intake from ""barely any"" to at min 64oz/day and cut down coffee to 2/day instead of my usual 4-5. 

**Where to go from here** – I’m having an epic food fest on my bday, took the day off and everything to basically stuff my face. After that, I’ll be upping my calories back to maintenance and will work on recomping to develop weaker areas (back, hamstrings, would like to get dem capped shoulders a la Sarah Connor in T2). Will probably drop my cardio down to 2 days a week vs my current 4.

For reference I'm 5'11 and 190lbs.

I used to drink maybe 20oz if water (maybe 40 if I was working out) and then just guzzle coffee literally all day long. 

I've recently gotten my diet in check and have been tracking my water intake. I've been at around 65oz of water per day plus some other fluids (coffee, tea, occasional beer or diet soda).

Despite the significant increase in water I still feel thirsty ALL. THE. TIME.

g0scfr,xxfitness,How to get over how little calories you need to eat to lose weight.,"I posted in the daily questions thread and was given a link to this TDEE calculator which is really comprehensive: [TDEE 3.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8EbfzFB0mBrMGJ6V2N5QWNfeTg/view) Thanks to u/[BarbellCappuccino](https://www.reddit.com/user/BarbellCappuccino) for linking to this! However, I'm still back at the same problem, which is that the spreadsheet calculates that my TDEE is pretty darn low and in order to lose weight at a reasonable pace (\~1lb a week) I have to eat about 1200 calories a day. That number has been so hard for me to stick to in the past. I probably will need to up the amount of calories and just lose weight slower, but whenever I see my recommended calories go to 1200 or lower it just kind of makes me feel like giving up, because sticking to calories that low is really hard. I've been actually working out more in quarantine and I'm building myself back up to running, so it sucks to see my TDEE hasn't really changed much.

Goals:

I'm 5'4"" and weigh 142 pounds with a BF% of around 28%. My goal weight is to get somewhere between 125-130 or get my body fat percentage down to about 23-24%.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some additional info for people asking about my diet, intermittent fasting and workouts. So, I usually try to strength train 2-3 times a week and then run/swim or HIIT another 2 times a week. I love strength training, but I don't have dumbbells at home so without the gym it's been mostly HIIT, bodyweight exercises and running. Lately, been working out 5x a week for about 20-30 minutes a day. Even though I'm working from home and usually have a sedentary job, I do have the most adorable corgi, so he helps to contribute to at least 3000-5000 steps per day for me.

In terms of diet, I've been trying to up my protein. I usually have some coffee with protein powder in it, a little creamer and some fruit. Then lunch is usually a sandwich or salad, and then for dinner it's a variety of stuff. Admittedly not always the best. Sometimes it's tacos, sometimes it's a burger, but sometimes it's Poke bowl or a salad. (For note, we probably eat salad as a meal at least 5-7 times a week and at least 2-3 times a week for dinner. Our salads usually involve lettuce, tomatoes, onions, radishes, protein of some sort (lately i've mostly be using fake crab), light italian dressing a little cheese). I've been trying to clean up my diet, recently I talked to my husband about how we really need to re-think some of our choices and eat out less (which actually is easier because of the pandemic). I also weigh pretty much everything now before I eat it so I know how much I'm actually eating.

I've done intermittent fasting before and stuck to it for a while, but I have a hard time I find I have problems with binge eating during my fasting window. I might work up to doing 16:8 again, but I know short people like me find the most success doing like 18:6 or 20:4 or OMAD.",2020-04-13 21:44:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/g0scfr/how_to_get_over_how_little_calories_you_need_to/
fuz6iw,xxfitness,Sustainable Fitness - Advice Wanted," Hey there!

I'd love some input as to whether my current eating regimen is ok long-term, taking my fitness goals into account. With a background of some slightly disordered orthorexic tendencies and being a little bit underweight for my height, my definition of ""health"" IS to gain a bit of weight and establish a 80/20 balance of nutritious foods to less nutritious foods. At 5""8, I weighed around 115 after Christmas, but am committed to ditching the scale entirely in 2020. I'm basically intuitive eating, not counting any calories/macros, but provided some loose ballparks below to give some insight:

1. Breakfast: Usually 3/4 c protein pancakes: 265cal and 28g protein (toppings vary) with fruit and coffee
2. Lunch: Greek Yogurt Bagel: 280 cal and 17g protein with peanut butter and banana, with fruit (or alternatively, two slices of toast with PB&J, \~3/4 c greek yogurt, and fruit)
3. Snack: Handful of veggies
4. Supper: Protein + Carb + Veg (mac and cheese with salad, chicken flatbread with broccoli, pizza with carrots and cucumber, etc.)
5. Snack: either a serving of dark chocolate or \~a cup of banana nice cream

My concern lies in two areas: the amount of refined carbs (pancakes everyday normal?!), and sweet foods in my daily eating as a sustainable, long term way of eating. I am not at all used to having things like peanut butter and chocolate almost daily but keep telling myself that overall, my meals are balanced and everything is in moderation. My goals is not ""clean eating"" but rather, to establish a nice balance with some party sprinkles thrown in to keep things easy going and un-restrictive. I few times a week, I'll have say, some chocolate chips in my pancakes, or some cookie butter on my greek yogurt bagel to keep my soul as fed as my body haha. Otherwise, I'd love some feedback on whether this is sustainable long term, or if this is a nice temporary goal to gain a bit of weight temporarily.",2020-04-04 18:58:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/fuz6iw/sustainable_fitness_advice_wanted/
fojsuh,xxfitness,"I've been cutting for so long that I'm not sure how to stop, and my new Covid-lockdown life is totally guaranteeing I'll keep cutting. Advice, please!","So, I've been cutting since mid September, more or less. I took 4 weeks off from Thanksgiving to Christmas but it wasn't until the 3rd week that I was finally eating at maintenance, and the 4th week to surplus. I really struggled to stop the cut. Dec 26th, I went right back to a big deficit.

The results are awesome, I've lost over 30 lbs since Sept and I'm only 2 lbs away from my long time goal weight of 149...which was supposed to not happen til June. I've still managed to put on muscle and strength in this time as well, which was extremely important to me. 

Here's the problem: I genuinely planned on ending this 2nd cut on March 13, I could not WAIT to go nuts on a salad bar and demolish a pizza...then CoViD hit hard that same day. Work sent us home until further notice, and so I've been home every day, just me and my toddler son (partner is considered essential employee at the post office so he is gone most of the day). And there is no salad bar, nor safe pizza, in CoViD life.

Now, on a normal schedule, I'm up super early to workout & work 8-5, and so I had to plan meals around that life. That schedule made me hungrier, and eat earlier...but on my own accord, I'm a natural intermittent faster; breakfast was only a habit for work life. There is no such thing for me as morning hunger. I much prefer to survive on black coffee for many hours after I wake. I also have to work out on an empty stomach or I'll barf. Combine that with now being able to work out during my partner's afternoon break (we have an amazing home gym built up over time), and I'm not eating til 1-2pm or later. So this becomes a 17+ hour fasting. And since my workouts are in the afternoon, I can also take super long runs (my absolute favorite workout) in the daylight, in additon to lifting/metcons, so I'm burning more calories than ever. Plus, I'm chasing aroind a toddler, and cleaning my house, and doing the extra chores I never had time for...so even more mega calorie burning.

So my dream cutting life scenario is now happening by default -- I can't even get close to maintenance calories! Hell, most days I'm eating less calories than I did in my cut!!! I've lost 5 more lbs in 10 days. My abs look amazing. But I know it's probably time to stop cutting. I just...don't know how. How do I just eat more when I've gotten so used to eating less, AND my life right now is totally 100% facilitating a cut?? Should I just roll with it and get stupid shredded? I'm just afraid of losing muscle mass. I love my big boulder shoulders and my ripped back. And I can actually see the big muscle in my legs defined thanks to the fat loss. So I'm just kinda stuck.

TL;DR: My home life is suddenly a dream cutting scenario by default and I have no clue how to stop cutting like I planned, or if I even should.",2020-03-25 04:03:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/fojsuh/ive_been_cutting_for_so_long_that_im_not_sure_how/
fog20l,xxfitness,Is there anyone else who simply cannot tolerate working their core?,"So I’ll preface this by saying that I know I’m a physically weak person. None of my muscle groups are particularly strong at this point, I’ve been training for about 6 months now. 5’6, 113 lbs. I’ve been making progress with most parts of my body, albeit slowly. The thing is, I simply hate working my core. Exercises that target my abdomen just feel...awful. Exerting my core causes discomfort in my abdomen. I know that the muscles will burn and ache, and I can handle it in other parts of my body. But when it’s my core, it isn’t just the muscles - I feel it in my stomach as well and it’s frankly sickening. My organs feel like they’re being tensioned and strained.

I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried targeting my core on an empty stomach, a partially full stomach containing various kinds of food and nothing but liquid (coffee and water). I’ve tried planks, hanging leg raises, crunches, reverse crunches, bicycle crunches and basically every other ab workout I could find. The moment my core starts getting hit, my belly just feels terrible. It’s a sensation I don’t enjoy at all.

Am I the only one who feels this way? I want to improve the appearance of my tummy, but for now I’ve basically abandoned trying to work my core. I understand that I should soldier through the pain, but it’s never going to stop is it? If I want my abs and core to get stronger, I’m going to have to experience this discomfort every single time I work them.

fa3kzg,xxfitness,Who here has changed gyms after many years? I want to hear your gym transition stories!,"Hello all!

Lately I've been feeling like my gym (crossfit-ish style but not crossfit) just isn't doing it for me anymore. Same old, same old, and I'm not learning many new techniques. There are alot of new people in the gym and the classes are catered to them - I've been at it a few years now so I know the ropes. Instructors are obviously focused on helping new people/ recruiting new people, and I sometimes feel (either rightly or wrongly) like I'm in the way. Sometimes I'm lifting so much more than the people around me that I feel weird about it, like I'm showing off somehow. Anyway. 

So I've had this voice in my head telling me that it's time to move on. I want to join an MMA-style gym with BJJ and Muay-Thai classes, and just continue my lifting at a generic 24-hour place. 

The problem is I'm a creature of habit, and I hate change, and I've made friends at my gym that I don't want to stop seeing, but I've got social issues that make it hard for me to turn gym friends into actual friends. So I'm stuck with one foot mentally/emotionally out the door, which is obviously a shitty place to be. 

So I want to hear about people who have been in my situation and have  moved on/ moved up. Was it easy? Was it hard? Was it the best thing you ever did? Was it a disaster? Did you keep your old gym friends and make new ones too? I want to hear all about it so I may ~~live vicariously~~ be inspired finally to make my own move!

f30epn,xxfitness,What am I doing so wrong that is causing my progress to regress so much?,"Hi all,

First of all please excuse my lack of proper language in terms of fitness, I’m very much a beginner at the gym.

I’ve been going to the gym about three times a week for an hour an at a time pretty consistently since September. I’m getting married in May and my goal was to tone up a little, lose some body fat and build some lean muscle. When I did my first Inbody scan I was at 32% body fat, 45.5 pounds skeletal muscle mass and 124.3 pounds. I’m 30 years old and 5’3.

During my gym sessions, I start with 20 minutes of walking at a slight incline (up to 6.5 depending on the day) just to get some steps in and to get my heart rate going. I would then spend 40 minutes on weights. I focused a lot on my arms in the beginning since my dress is strapless. I started with 8 pound free weights for curls, now I can do 12.5 pounds. So I progressed, but slowly. I also incorporated squats with the kettle ball between 20-25 pounds and the barbell at 30 pounds. I also use machines for my legs and booty. I’ve been slowly increasing the weights.

As an aside, I’m a teacher. While it’s not the most active job of all time, I am on my feet often and get a good amount of steps in per day. I definitely don’t sit at my desk for eight hours a day like some people.

I feel like I eat a pretty balanced diet. I don’t drink any soft drinks or juice. Most of the time I just drink water and coffee with almond milk and brown cane sugar. My biggest vice is a good beer, but I only treat myself on the weekends and even then it’s only one or two. And not even every weekend. I love vegetables and fruits and lean meats, don’t have a big sweet tooth so I hardly ever have sweets.

I’ve been trying to do an InBody scan once a month to help motivate me. At first it was great. In October, I got down to 27% body fat and 48 pounds of SMM. I was feeling good about my progress!

Of course the holidays rolled around and some good food was had and I went back up to 29% body fat after I spent 10 days in Spain eating my fiancé’s mother’s home cooking.  I also gave myself costochondritis from lifting improperly and had to take an additional week off. But  after the holidays and when I was better,  I came back, got into a regular schedule again and was careful about what I ate.  I would even go so far as to say I was more careful than usual.

I’m just getting over a nasty two week illness. I went to the gym a few times when I was sick, although I wasn’t operating at 100%, but I figured doing something was better than nothing. I was mucousy, had a terrible cough, felt lethargic, and couldn’t taste much so I wasn’t eating as much as usual even.

I went back to the gym today to get a scan and I’m pretty dismayed. I’m at 31% body fat AND 45.5 SMM—which is where I was when I started!!! I’m trying to understand what I’m doing so wrong—how can I be back to where I started, back when I wasn’t working out at all? Again, besides about 10 days during the holidays and the bought of sickness, I’ve been going to the gym three times a week, increasing weights slowly, doing full body workouts. What could I be doing SO wrong that’s giving me the same results as when I was not working out at all?

I tried to talk to a trainer at the gym, but I have to say she was not very helpful and very pushy about signing me up for a trainer. I’m not opposed to the idea and am looking into it, I’m just really flabbergasted and this community is so knowledgeable (I’ve been lurking for awhile!!)

Thank you so much in advance.",2020-02-12 23:35:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/f30epn/what_am_i_doing_so_wrong_that_is_causing_my/
ey5wkd,xxfitness,Puppy/Dog Owners: What is your daily routine and how/when do you go to the gym?,"Edit; there are tons of great answers here. Currently at work and will comment once free!

Hi ladies! 

I’m a new puppy mom to a 16 week old mid-large breed (size and age given for bladder capacity reference; had him for one week) and I’m just dying to get back into the gym. It’s been about 4 months for me and I just want to start my routine back up. 

I used to work out in the mornings but wouldn’t be opposed to an evening session. The most difficult thing for me right now is I have ample time in my schedule but I’m nervous about leaving the dog alone more than necessary and not giving him enough attention/exercise/mental stimulation. 

Also: I’m lucky enough to live a 10 minute drive to my office, and the gym occupies the whole first floor of the building. 

My current schedule is:

* 5:00 - 6:00: Wake up; potty outdoors, play a bit indoors; I have a coffee. Make his breakfast around 6:00
* 6:00 - 6:45: take pup for a 10 minute walk (poo time!), come inside and start prepping my lunch for the day
* 6:45 - 7:45: crate the dog and shower, get ready for work. Let him out and play a bit more
* 7:45 - 8:30: Last walk of the morning, go to the dog park and throw the ball around, tire him out. 
* 8:30: Leave for work
* 12:30 - 1:15: Home to let the dog out and hang a bit, play. Back at work by 1:30ish
* 5:30: Home; walk. 
* 6:00 - 10:30: his dinner and mine, 2-3 more walks, 
Playtime, then bedtime. I’m lazy during this time. 

As you can see, I have a ton of time available to me, and I’ve been able to leave no problem for other appointments. As stated before, the gym occupies the whole bottom floor of my office building, so I’d like to avoid driving there and back for a third time a day, but I know I’m making excuses. 

So my question is, how can I make sure I’m stimulating my dog and giving him quality time, and not feel like a bad dog mom for crating him for a third time in the day? His bladder capacity is around 5 hours now, so I can’t lump the gym into my time at the office just yet.

First of all, yall are mega inspiring and I love reading everyone's updates in the daily threads. It makes me feel like I'm friends with a lot of you frequent posters, haha. I just turned the big 30 and as a birthday present to myself, I got a DEXA scan and VO2max test. 

[DEXA results, me the day of the text, me a couple days earlier mirin myself in the gym locker room, and VO2Max results](https://imgur.com/a/uXWICVY)

Current Diet:

I've been vegan for around 2 years, and was vegetarian for 2 years before that. I eat probably 80-90% whole foods. A typical day of eating for me is usually:

* black coffee for breakfast
* oatmeal with flax / peanut butter / bananas, or leftovers for lunch
* dinner is usually some combination of beans (chickpeas, black beans, tempeh, tofu, lentils), grains (rice, farro, millet) assorted vegetables (beets, carrots, onions, zucchini, peppers, broccoli, I could go on lol ...), and green leafies (I *love* collard greens, also kale, chard, cabbage). It varies a lot.
* I also eat a lot of fruit — apples, blueberries, oranges
* late night snacks include popcorn, and whatever sweet baked experiment my fiance cooks up while stoned
* Gallon of water

I eat pretty clean during the week, but I'm not too strict about it and I won't say no to some junk food every now and then. I probably average around 2000 cals a day for maintenance. 

Current Routine:

I'm mostly a runner. I ran a marathon last spring, and once I achieved that goal I parlayed that into a new goal of running 1000 miles within the year, which I did. I also had a goal of getting a pullup, but I'm still working on that (but not really hard, lol). Over the summer I started incorporating more weight training and I really enjoy that too. I currently run 15-25 miles a week and lift two days a week. Current PRs (for reps) are: 135lb squat, 185lb DL, 70lb bench (haha), and 50lb OHP. I'm about to start a training plan for a half marathon this spring.

Going forward:

I was really surprised by those results! I was going to be happy at 26% BF, so this was pleasantly surprising. Very surprised by the low amount of visceral fat and low percentage of android fat, as I always thought my tum was one of my bigger areas. I also lost about 45 lbs several years ago, so I think I still have a heard time seeing my new bod objectively sometimes. 

The VO2Max test was again, surprising. I never thought I'd get into the ""superior"" category, but here we are. After strapping on a heart rate monitor and the darth vader mask, I then ran on the treadmill at a comfortable pace while the administrator gradually increased the incline. It was nice and easy at first but then, oh boy. When I asked what I could expect during the test, the doc jokingly said he was going to make me puke and ... I almost did y'all. Right into that mask. Worth it though?

I'm getting married later this year, so now I'm trying to decide on aesthetic goals for that. I think I'd like to get more swole, but also cut like 5-6 more lbs for better definition? What do you think?

eue92f,xxfitness,Any early morning (before work/school) gym folks here? I am so excited to get into a routine and make sure it sticks! How do you prep/pack/plan?!,"**EDIT: thank you everyone for your input! I simply could not have imagined to receive so many truly helpful tips and ideas!  You all contributed to helping me get out the door!  Thank you all so much!!**

I have been an on and off again gym-goer, and never found a routine I could stick it out with and ultimately would lose interest.  I'm finally at a place where I can budget some time (and money) to go to the gym consistently.  It makes more sense for me to just go first thing in the morning, since it is on the way to school for me (29yo, went back to college!) and I love the mornings.  If I'm being real with myself, it's so hard to leave the house every evening once I am home, and it's time I spend doing homework and with my dog and keeping up with the house.

Tomorrow will be the first go with adjustments to come I am sure... but the rough idea is to:

5:00 am - wake up, let the dog out, brush teeth, throw on gym clothes, grab coffee/packed lunch, and grab whatever I'll need for the day

5:15 am - leave house

5:30 am - arrive to gym, work out for 45-60 min.

~6:30 am - finish workout, clean up (?? Will have to feel this one out) 

7:00 am - leave gym for school

7:30 am - arrive to school, have breakfast, finish coffee, classes start at 8:30 am (I like to be early to get some homework time in and hand in assignments due at 8:20 am, etc.)

I honestly don't know what to expect or plan for with cleaning up after working out.  I do sweat and I have curly hair that I often blow dry and flat iron, but I can shower and throw some gel in and call it a day.  I also do not wash my hair every day and I hope I can still find a way to navigate this with exercise.  For makeup I might wear a thin layer of foundation, mascara and some brown powder for my lashline and brow... that's it.  I think I can pull it off in 30 min!  I'll have to pack all of my things though.  I would like to avoid driving back home and losing the extra 30 min to driving back and forth.

I'd love to see what you do with your routines!  I'm open to suggestions if you see something I am doing critically wrong! 😊 You are all an inspiration to me and inspire to be healthier.  I'm in a male-dominated technical program in college so I just hope to be stronger and have better insurance so I can rely on myself to keep up with any physical work.",2020-01-26 22:35:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/eue92f/any_early_morning_before_workschool_gym_folks/
eog9ba,xxfitness,Being more active question - ideas on how to get more walking in throughout my day.,"Not sure if this has been asked before but I’ve realized that as I’ve gained weight it’s because I’m working increasingly sedentary jobs. I try to workout at least 3 times a week and yoga class twice a week. I’m bumping it up to seven this week and going forward because I’ve gained 20 in the past two years and at my height it’s starting to be a not so good thing. 
I used to be skinny and that’s probably due to the fact I was alway up and moving.  I played outside as a kid all the time. School years and college years - I walked everywhere. Then as I got more desk like jobs, I’ve found myself taking about 6,000ish steps a day. 
I’m thinking if I get off my butt more, I can give my weight loss a boost and raise my resting calorie burn from 1,400 to something a little higher (maybe?)
Right now I work alone in an office where I spend a lot of time on the computer. Also the weather where I am means outdoor exercise is uncomfortable (aka freezing cold)
I was debating on setting timers on my phone for once each hour of my work day, measuring the distance of my office’s length, and figuring out how to walk a couple of miles that way Monday through Friday.  But then I felt slightly crazy going that far. 

Any tips?  Or things that helped you move a little more throughout the day? 

I’ve also debated just staying longer at the gym in the morning and walking a couple of miles on the treadmills with the older folks who come in during that time. Kinda like a cool down?

elmw4u,xxfitness,Tips and Tricks for Spin Class,"Hi everyone!

My gym (and the spin class) is super crowded these days with folks who have set new years resolutions to be more active and or lose weight this year! You might be one of those people if so welcome! Or maybe you're a regular gym goer but interested in spin class. I have some tips and tricks that might help you!

&#x200B;

I first started going to spin classes when I was a fitness noob (in 2016). I couldn't do a single push up and had no idea how to sit on a bike. I've never been an instructor myself though one day I hope to be but I have been to spin classes at multiple gyms with many different instructors.

# For Beginners

For some the class might be intimating. It helps to know what to expect, what to bring and what to do:

**What to Expect:**

This is going to be a tough cardio class for beginners. Don't be scared though because the more you do it then better you get at it. It takes 1-2 weeks of consistently going to a spin class 2x a week to feel comfortable. The class might depend on the type of bikes the gym has. Some gyms have ""coach by color"" bikes where the different cardio zones are indicated by colors on your bike and some gyms might have very simple bikes with a simple screen. Either way the goal is to condition you. The bikes have a resistance knob that you'd adjust to mimics how riding on a small or big hill would feel like and so on. If you're new, your lungs might hurt and your heart rate would get uncomfortably high but it's okay and you'll be okay!  If it makes you feel more prepared, you can look up spin classes on youtube as well to get a grasp on what to expect. It also helps to come in a bit earlier than everyone else to inspect the room and the bikes and get comfortable.

Listen to the instructors. Believe it or not this was actually hard for me to do at first. I was confused and wasn't focused. It really helps to just focus on the class and forget about work/school/etc for an hour.

Keep in mind that these classes are usually crowded so you won't get individual attention from the instructor. Because of this be sure to set up your bike properly and take my tips on avoiding injury (more on this later).

**What to Bring/wear:**

\- A water bottle. You'll get thirsty and would need lots of water during and after the class. Make sure it opens and closes easily as you'd need to drink while pedaling on a bike.

\-  A towel. It gets sweat out of your face and sometimes the handles get too slippery with sweat so having a towel helps a lot!

\- Bike shorts and leggings work well. Dress light as it gets super hot and sweaty.

**Should I eat beforehand?**

If you're a beginner it might help to eat a quick carb-y snack like a bar or a banana. I usually do my spin class in the mornings so I'm fasted and I drink my coffee on the way to the gym.

**Setting up Your Bike**

Bike set up can be confusing. My first tip is to ask the instructor. If not watch a youtube video on it like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csNeUKYBW0E).

**Do I Stretch?**

I don't stretch much before only because I don't like static stretches. I arrive early to the class to warm up on a flat road before the class starts. The instructors might tell you how to stretch before and specially after. I stretch my wrists, neck, hamstrings, calf, hip flexors and quads.

**Do I need Special Shoes/clothing?**

For first class or beginner? absolutely not. You can just cycle in your regular shoes but the more seriously you decide to do it, it helps to have shoes. They help with knee and stability issues. I'm looking into buying cycling shoes so I don't have any recommendations yet.

You don't need cycling shorts though they're comfortable and nice. I've seen some folks bring padding for their seat but in my experience it's not needed. You might feel bruised after the first day but just like everything else you'll get used to it.

**Avoid Injury with These Tips**

\- Don't put all your weight on you wrist. It's tempting specially if you've just started but you're supposed to hold your upper body with the power of your core!

\- PLEASE adjust seats properly like I said above. So many women in my class have their seat to 0 and it has no height. It puts extra pressure on your knee and makes cycling harder. If you feel pain in the front of your knee your seat needs to be higher!

\- Don't put the resistance too low. Your hips shouldn't be bouncing off when you're cycling. Find your ""flat road"". A lot of people think when the instructor says ""flat road"" they mean zero resistance but that's not true. Zero resistance is downhill and usually only used in recovery. Flat road should feel some resistance but not too much. You should feel like you can cycle at this resistance for hours. Then base everything else off flat road.

\- Don't put resistance too high! Sometimes instructors ask you to increase resistance and it's actually really fun to push through high resistance. However, in my experience the combination of high resistance and high speed is a deadly recipe for your knees so be aware! If you start feeling pain in your knee reduce resistance.

\- Keep your feet at a natural angle. I think beginners tend to point their foot downwards but this will put extra pressure on your knee.

\- This might be strange to explain but it shouldn't feel like you're putting pressure on your knee to make circles. It should feel like you're pulling up your legs with your quads and it's naturally making big circles.

**I don't have a gym membership or my gym doesn't offer spin**

You can still do this if you have a bike at home or just a regular bike at the gym! There are plenty of spin videos on youtube that you can follow along.

# If You Have Bad Knees

This is my favorite topic. I suffer from jumper's knee and I have just finished a 3 month therapy program to fix everything related to it. If you have bad knees you might have heard how much cycling is good for the knees and it is! it puts less pressure on your knees than walking as my PT says but it has to be done properly.

\- The first tip is to like I said, adjust your seat. But not just your seat, your pedals and the height of your handle bars. You will end up making your knees worse if these adjustments aren't correct.

\- If you have knocked knees or a knee(s) that naturally rotates inwards, be mindful! Make sure it's not collapsing inward and keep it straight.

\- Get cycling shoes. These help with knees and I'm looking to get a pair. If not, again make sure you're paying attention to the position of your foot. Keep your foot at a natural position.

\- Watch cadence specially if you have medial knee pain. Focus on speed instead of resistance. Speed above 80 mph is easier on knees.

\- Go lightly. Every time you introduce a new routine, seating position, etc go lightly again with high speed, low resistance to get your body comfortable.

\- Get those quads burning! This is an advice general to people with knee issues. Get the muscles attached to it strong! Gluteus medius, quads, hamstrings, etc.

\- Related to that, use your quads. Like I said, you should feel like you're lifting with your quads and not leaving it up your knee to bend with every circle. It helps to visualize this if you cycle in front of a mirror.

\- Avoid standing runs unless you know how to do them well. Standing runs are a good way to catch a break from seated position but if you end up putting all your weight on your legs as you're bending them (which most beginners do), it might stress your knee.

\- If your knee starts to hurt please don't push through. Listen to your body and take a break. Give it a week rest with the usual RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) and go back at it when you're healed (remember high speed, low res).

\- If you end up taking all the precautions and still get knee pain then don't do spin classes. It's not your fault! these classes focus on hitting high resistance heavily and sometimes knees don't do well with such workouts! You can still do your own workout on a bike without the spin class!

\### Training

I (mostly) followed a HR-based training program from Garmin. It was incredibly low-mileage for a marathon program (the midweek runs were usually 3-5 miles each, with usually 3 runs per week).  Since I know it's hard to get through your first marathon training without getting injured, I was fine with the low mileage. I also kept up lifting 1-2 times per week for the first couple months, but was much less serious about it, and eventually dropped off as I got closer to race day. 

I missed 2 long runs while I was traveling in Europe, with about 6 weeks to go til the race. I had done a 14 miler before I left for the trip, so when I got back I did 16, 18, and 20-milers the next 3 weekends. Then tapered til race day! 

I also got sick a week before the race and only got one run in that week, but at that point I don't think anything mattered. By race day, I felt back to 100%!

&#x200B;

\### Pre-race

I am the luckiest person on the planet, and had both my husband and best friend (who flew literally across the country for this) there to support me. They came to the expo with me, took me out for a nice dinner the night before, and I was feeling so ready to do this! 

I set 3 alarms on 3 different apps for the morning of. I had nightmares ALL NIGHT of either missing the bus to the start, or forgetting my gear, etc. But I did sleep! My first alarm went off at 4 and I was up immediately and feeling tired but good. I went to the hotel lobby and had coffee and tried to eat a bagel, but I was nervous and could barely touch it. I started looking around at all the other runners and panicking that I was an idiot - I was wearing a tank top and regular leggings, they were all in sweats and jackets. The weather was in the high 40s to start, which to me (being from Denver) is warmer than my long runs typically start. I finally started talking to a guy who pointed out they're all Californians, and this is cold to them! Like, duh. 

Caught the bus to the start, and bc of the hotel I stayed in, I had access to a heated tent with coffee and food. I started talking to a girl my age, and we had a ton in common, and got along great! It was really helping my nerves, so I ate another half a bagel and some more coffee. Then I went to the bathroom one last time, lined up at the start, and started getting REALLY PUMPED!!! This was happening!!!

&#x200B;

\### Race

My main goal was just to finish, but I had sub-5 in the back of my mind, so I lined up with the 4:50 pace group. We started out and I was trying really hard to hold back, but everything felt AMAZING - the weather, my rested legs, my lungs - so I was going faster than anticipated, but nothing crazy. There were lots of rolling hills in the first half of the race, but I barely noticed them, since I trained at altitude and was now at sea level, they didn't seem hard at all. 

My husband and friend were supposed to be at mile 10 to cheer me on, but I got a text from my husband saying the traffic was bad and they wouldn't get there. I told them I was feeling fantastic anyway, so they should go on to a later mile marker. I saw them at mile 12, kissed my husband, said ""btw, I'm feeling amazing???"" and continued on my way. 

At the halfway point, I accidentally PR'ed my half marathon time by a minute and a half. That was crazy. 

Through mile 15 or so I still felt absolutely on top of the world. It was the best runner's high I've ever experienced. I saw my husband and best friend again at mile 16, but after that the crowd support started thinning out, my legs started to get tired, and I slowed down my pace a bit, but I knew I was really on track to hit sub-5. From this point on I walked through the aid stations ( just enough to drink some nuun and water) but ran the rest. I was tired, but I knew I could do it. 

At mile 20 I was fearing ""The Wall,"" but I never felt it at all. I just kept chugging along, absolutely overjoyed that I was actually doing this. At one point some of the signs from the crowd were getting really inspirational, and I started crying, and then hyperventilating a little bit, just from emotion. I slowed down, thought only about my breathing, and put my audiobook back on (yes, I ran the marathon listening to an audiobook, bc it REALLY helped keep my brain calm). 

It was surreal knowing I was running further than I'd ever run, and faster than I thought I could. What was even happening. Miles 21-26 are just a blur of ""my legs hurt, my toes hurt, but I CAN keep moving.""  

At Mile 26 I saw my people again, and they were just like ""you're doing it!! you're doing it!!"" and I was like ""I'M DOING IT!!!"" They got a picture of me dancing and looking so so happy at mile 26, that I'm really proud of.  I turned the corner and saw the finish line and just went all-out toward it. I crossed, got my medal, my husband got my attention, and I went over to him and hugged him, and absolutely broke down sobbing on his shoulder. My friend got pics of this and they're really sweet. 

&#x200B;

\### Post-race

I went directly to the beer tent and got my free beer, and holy crap did it taste awesome. 

My husband and I celebrated in Napa and it's been great. 

My toes are pretty mad, and my legs are sore, but overall I feel fantastic. 

I can't believe how ACTUALLY FUN my first marathon was. I can't believe I enjoyed it while I was running it. I can't wait to run more. I will probably train for a half next, but I know I'll do more marathons, and I'm really really excited for them. 

I would love to answer questions, if I left anything out. I could talk about this race all day. 

&#x200B;

And MOST IMPORTANTLY, a huge thank-you to you guys, r/xxfitness, for the AWESOME support you all gave me leading up to this race. You guys are the absolute best, and I love being part of this community.

e5120y,xxfitness,Newbie gains ending?,"I started writing this in the simple questions thread, and then realized that it was too involved... 

*Background:* 

I pretty diligently track... well, everything. 

Including BF % percentage, through calipers, Navy method, and BIA (knowing that the BIA is inaccurate, but controlling the results for known hydration impacts, and based on what it was when I also had BodPod testing done). Between the three, and visuals/muscle striation/appearance, I have a good sense of what my BF percentage is. 

Likewise, everything that goes into my mouth is weighed and tracked, down to the 6 calories in my black iced coffee. I had BMR testing done, and confidently can say that between that, my logging, and real-life results based on that, I know what my TDEE is and what my intake is with minimal error. 

Yes, my spreadsheets are a thing of beauty. ;) 

*Problem:* 

I started lifting in spring 2018, and unfortunately followed the broscience that you couldn't build muscle in a deficit. I didn't realize that newbie gains could last for 6-18 months depending on training frequency -- and my frequency was really low from January - July 2019 -- and that building some muscle in a \*moderate\* deficit was entirely possible (I've consistently kept my cut to between 250 and 375 calories a day -- less than a 15 percent deficit). And not knowing that the whole ""you can't build muscle in a deficit"" was too damn black and white, I was infuriated when my clothes were fitting looser, but I was losing weight so damn slowly. Because none of it made sense.

Once I figured this out, I suddenly understood why both my dietitian and my sports med doc looked at me like I had three heads when I was all ""I don't understand, you can't build muscle mass in a deficit."" (I'd reached out to both of them when I was so damn confused.)

*Actual question:* 

For the past three months, it looks like my muscle mass is \*finally\* stable -- it's always hovering in the same range, with no more than .3 or so difference from month to month. I am consistently losing fat -- and weight.

Does this mean that I've likely finally hit the end of my newbie gains, and my body will finally \*consistently\* likely focus on losing fat, and not adding as much muscle? 

Because I don't mind the muscle gains, but it was discouraging for so long to not see scale drops that reflected the effort I was putting in. And if this is finally the light at the end of the tunnel that I've been hoping for, I am downright thrilled.",2019-12-02 16:02:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/e5120y/newbie_gains_ending/
dr3v00,xxfitness,Push/Pull/Legs and Cardio,"F, 27, 5'0. CW: 145LBS, GW: Unsure, I like to go by how clothes fit, but I'd say 115 or so. 

Hi xxfitness! I browsed the PPL posts in the sub when i was learning about the routine and it has been serving me well so far. The only thing I'm having trouble with is the 6 days per week. I'm a beginner so I've been going MWF to ease myself into it and get the form down, find the right weight to push myself but not too much. Also working on what I can eat. As a 5'0 woman (27, CW 145) my primary goal is fat/weight loss and becoming leaner. I eat 1200 on nongym days and around 1500 on gym days, trying to eat a lot of protein. 

The problem is I don't know that I'll ever be able to get to the gym 6x per week! I have a very limited time I can go during weekdays because of my ft job (about an hour a day for the workout itself, not factoring in getting to the gym, showering, being ready for work and going there).

My question: if I stayed doing PPL 3 days per week and then did swimming cardio 2 days per week (pool v close to house), would that help at all? I lost 30 pounds over the last two years with just lifestyle changes (walking more, cut out pop and cream and sugar in coffee, walked more) but I'm back in a sedentary job again and terrified to gain it back.

1muvwag,Biohackers,Using Ai to Create Custom Stacks,"So I spent a lot of time with Chat GPT to figure out my “perfect” stack. I asked it to only recommend supplements that have been scientifically proven to work. I asked it to consider my age, sex, and other personal details. I told it I don’t want to waste a dime, so don’t recommend things that will not have an impact. I had it review it’s own recommendations over and over again. The results were: 

Morning 
	•	Coffee – for alertness/performance.
	•	L-Theanine 200mg – smooths caffeine buzz, helps focus.
	•	Vitamin C 500mg – immune support
	•	Thorne Multi – 1 cap here (7.5mg zinc, plus other micros).
	•	Omega-3 + CoQ10 – heart, joints, mitochondrial function.
	•	Creatine 5g – daily for strength, recovery, and cognitive support.

Evening (30–60 min before bed)
	•	Vitamin C 500mg – keeps immune support levels steady.
	•	ZMA (1 pill = 10mg zinc) 
	•	Magnesium Glycinate 200–300 mg 
	•	L-Theanine 200mg 
	•	Tart Cherry   

I have noticed a lot of people on Reddit seems to be anti-Ai, but doesn’t it provide us a good service? It’s referencing studies and making seemingly good recommendations. I’m not saying it can’t make mistakes, it can. But with some double checking by a human it seems to be very helpful. 

What do you think of this Ai assisted stack?

1mt7v8t,Biohackers,Reduce Coffee jitters with an extra extraction step,"Salute, I've done a few basic extractions of THC and psilocybin before. So when a poster on this subreddit asked about coffee brewing methods and mentioned all the different types of active chemicals, it made me think!

And so I bring you N=1  knowledge that is easily backed up if you simply...try it!

**The Facts** \- Coffee has more than just ""caffeine"". Most people I've read online agree that 'pure' caffeine alone has less 'jitter' than cheap coffee.

The Hypothesis - Better brewing reduces the amount of bitter and undesirable chemicals in coffee.

**THE INNOVATION -**

After making decent coffee - preferably not in a machine !  
Then you freeze it!

I have noticed that the bottom of the ice cube trays has a collection of thicker sludgy material. The upper portion of the ice is smooth and light brown.

Essentially, by fr*eez*ing the coffee, you're forcing some stuff to precipitate or settle out.

Final notes -

My partner doesn't like the taste of coffee, **however she thinks it tastes pleasant after doing the extra extraction step.**

She is a confirmed cilantro-soap-gene bearer, so I trust her supertaster senses.

Alright, if you have the ability to test further, have at it.

Otherwise, this is a small biohack that gives me a more controlled 'high' from coffee. It's smoother, less jittery, and I feel like I don't need as much to get the effect I want.

I strongly feel that freezing the coffee after brewing an already 'above average' cup  was a strong enough innovation to bring to you, r/Biohackers. (It's something people do every day, so it is a potential huge change).

Also, you can now prep the coffee the night before, which might be useful for some.

Its simple, but so many people drink coffee and i believe I have heard a LOT of discussion about the different substances that go into coffee. This is an easy way for \*YOU\* to see if this changes how coffee affects you.

1mok6k0,Biohackers,L-Tyrosine and L-Theanine,"Hey!

Sorry if this has been asked before but couldn’t find a satisfactory answer when searching the sub. 

Has anyone tried mixing L-Tyrosine and L-Theanine or tried both separately?

I’ve only tried L-Tyrosine and take 500mg when needing a little focus and 1000mg if more is ”needed”. Five days in a row at max with 2-3 days off to avoid any depletion or imbalance.

I’ve read about L-Theanine with caffeine as doing pretty much the same in regards to focus and motivation.

I usually drink like a pot of coffee a day I might add.

I had an exam last week, and I took a full break afterward. I have another exam next week, and have to study but can't. 

My diet hasn’t changed and I would say is balanced. Eggs, cheese, nuts, in the morning. Chicken and salad for lunch. I'm sleeping from around 12:30 AM to 8:00 AM consistently.

I also drink coffee \~90 mins after I wake up. No alcohol or smoking. No known health issues.

  
I still can’t seem to mentally engage with studying at all. I sit down and my brain just *won’t cooperate*. I feel physically fine, no illness or pain, just this strange mix of sleepiness and cognitive shut-off, like I could nap at any moment.

I’ve tried:

* Getting sunlight and walking
* Working out
* Taking a break from screens
* Pomodoro sessions and other study tricks

I am considering trying nicotine gums since I absolutely can't fail my exam, but I don’t want to start throwing things at the wall without knowing what’s really going on.

Is this burnout? Underlying deficiency? Any supplement, habit, or check-up that helped you?

1mlrqq4,Biohackers,Could extreme routine protect you from getting sick?,"I’ve been wondering about something I keep seeing in my environment: the people who almost never get sick tend to be total creatures of habit.

Best example: a male colleague of mine, 40, gay, no kids. His lifestyle is… let’s say, not what you’d call “healthy.”

- Breakfast: every single day, a sweet pastry from the bakery + coffee.
- Then a baking soda tablet for his heartburn.
- Eats only cooked food, meat for lunch and dinner, almost no vegetables, nothing fresh, no raw fruit or veg.
- After work and on weekends: sits at home gaming or watching series.
- Never exercises, avoids the sun, skin is pale.
- Doesn’t smoke, doesn’t drink alcohol.
- Only health issue: a short seasonal allergy (a few days in May).
- Though he doesn‘t move a lot, he is super skinny. 

And yet… this guy is never sick. No colds, no stomach bugs, nothing.

Here’s my question: could his extreme routine - doing the same thing every single day, never changing his diet or habits - mean his body and immune system aren’t “overloaded” by variation? Even though his lifestyle is objectively unhealthy, maybe the lack of novelty keeps stress on his system low, so he’s less vulnerable to infections?

Curious what the science-minded here think. Is “boring consistency” a hidden immune hack, or just coincidence?",2025-08-09 15:10:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mlrqq4/could_extreme_routine_protect_you_from_getting/
1mlp93r,Biohackers,Rate my biohacking routine,"I'd like to share my biohacking routine with you. Please rate and suggest any changes, perhaps supplements, I could add.

**Basic information:** Age: 32

**Diet:**

Mostly Mediterranean. I eat the same thing almost every day, only the quantities change depending on whether I'm bulking or cutting. It looks something like this:

* Breakfast: Eggs, cottage cheese, mozzarella, vegetables (and toast, for example, if I'm bulking)
* Lunch/Pre-workout meal: Chicken + rice + vegetables (beef instead of chicken once a week)
* Dinner: WPC/Skyr/Some fruit

I start each day with a cup of matcha (very rarely coffee), and I drink green tea throughout the day.

Between meals, I sometimes have a protein snack, like low-fat chips. etc.

**Supplements:**

* Morning (after breakfast)

Vitamin D + K, Omega-3, Coenzyme Q10, Vitamin C, Finasteride

* Midday

NAC, Quercetin + Bromelain, Creatine Monohydrate (non-training days)

* Before training:

Creatine Monohydrate, Citrulline, pre-workout stack

* Evening (after dinner/before bed)

MgZB (Magnesium + Zinc + Vitamin B), Potassium, Collagen, Biotin, Ashwagandha

Once or twice a week I add selenium, copper, and iron.

**Illnesses:**

* Asthma - something I've been struggling with since childhood. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. I take a medication called Asaris daily, which makes the symptoms disappear completely for a day (sometimes more).
* Androgenetic alopecia, very mild, I noticed that my temple started receding, so I started using finasteride (0.5 mg daily) and minoxidil to combat it - so far, I haven't experienced any side effects.
* Gray hair - I have a few scattered grays, but there's probably nothing I can do about them - I dye my hair with a gray remover every now and then.

**Lifestyle:**

* I work remotely in IT, earn a decent living, and I live relatively frugally, investing my surplus funds.
* After work, I spend a lot of time at the gym (4 workouts a week, I have a trainer who guides me).
* I try to be active every afternoon, even if I don't go to the gym (walking/biking/rollerblading).
* I have a girlfriend, and therefore have regular sex.

**Addictions:**

* None at all - I don't drink alcohol, smoke, or use drugs. I occasionally eat something sweet or high-calorie.
* I've even recently cut back on coffee – I've replaced it with good-quality matcha.
* Sometimes I have a weakness for protein-based sweets, which aren't always a healthy alternative.

**Skincare:**

* Morning - Moisturizing Cream with SPF 30, Zinc, Vitamins C and E
* Evening - Regenerating Cream with Retinol

I’ve noticed that during the day my brain feels like it’s working at about 20% capacity — slow and tired. But at night my mind suddenly feels like it’s working at 300% — clear, sharp, and focused. My mom experiences something similar, but my dad doesn’t.

I have allergies to pollen (I don't know if it is pollen, bacause I wasnt tested for it.) and usually get a runny nose during the summer. I take Aerius for it and runny noses get away. My mom is allergic to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), and her brother also has allergies plus some skin rashes.

I need to say I'm very poor student a my grades are not good. I'm trying to learnt hard but I don't get it.

1mity6v,Biohackers,BEAN Index,"I need some community help here. I was pondering the different health benefits of beverages and thought it would be helpful to have an index to assess drinks. What inspired it was a post that said if drinking coke was a 10/10 on the unhealthy scale, a Diet Coke would be 1/10. So with that in mind, here’s what I’m thinking. 

Let’s make basic water from a safe tap as the baseline of 100. Anything worse is lower. Anything better is higher. A Zero would be like a poison that kills you instantly. Everything else is scaled off of how mucsh it could increase or decrease your health pan. Health span is a simple product of lifespan * quality of life. For example, drinking alcohol daily may score 80% lifespan compare to drinking water and 50% quality of life. Thus it would be 40 in the Beverage Efficacy Approximation Number (BEAN). Something like hydrolized water or green tea could increase quality or life span and score > 100. 

Obviously there will be lots of guessing, but hopefully there will be some consensus. 

Here’s a starter list if anyone wants to put in some index approximation. 

Water = 100

Beer

Wine

Propel 

Coffee (black)

Milk

Coke

**The Numbers:**

* Chronological: 42 years old
* 2023 epi age: 34.44 years
* 2024 epi age: 33.72 years
* 2025 test: Just submitted a few days ago (relationship stress + holiday chaos this year—a bit nervous about that one)
* Lab conclusion: ""No acceleration in epigenetic aging... effectively slowed the aging process""

**Lab Results:** [View all test results and analysis](https://imgur.com/a/saF3wDq)

**My Protocol:**

**🍽️ Nutrition:**

* 20:4 intermittent fasting (eating 12pm-4pm)
* Mediterranean diet at home, tracked macros: \~3000 kcal | 160g protein | 400g carbs | 75g fat (varies with training goals)
* Don't track when eating out (1-3x/month)
* No added sugar (stevia for tea/coffee, stevia/xylitol when cooking)

**💊 Supplements:** *Morning (fasted):*

* NMN: 500mg
* CaAKG: 500mg
* Ginkgo Biloba: 500mg *(honestly not sure why - friend's rec)*

*Breakfast (12pm):*

* Resveratrol: 1g
* Vitamin D3: 1000-2000 IU + K2: 100mcg
* Omega-3: 1000mg + Astaxanthin
* Super Greens: 8g + Collagen: 14g

*Evening:*

* NMN: 500mg + CaAKG: 500mg
* Magnesium L-Threonate: 1000mg

*Monthly:* Fisetin senolytic protocol (1500mg × 2 consecutive days)

**🏋️ Training:** Strength training 6/7 days (often short sessions)

**😴 Sleep:** 8 hours tracked nightly

**🧴 Skincare:** Basic care + 0.5% retinol (started 0.2%)

**What Didn't Work (hair loss proving trickiest):**

* **Finasteride** → ED (don't recommend)
* **Topical fisetin** → Zero improvement, plus this stuff is really nasty for your pillows/clothes
* Currently trying: topical minoxidil, LLLT, ketoconazole weekly (minimal visible progress)

**Lifestyle:**

* No alcohol/drugs (except occasional laughing gas at rave parties—it's legal here in Sweden! 🇸🇪)
* Had shockwave therapy for post-finasteride issues (no regrets)

**How I Feel:** Physically feel much better than 10 years ago, maybe even better than 20 years ago - mostly from exercise and nutrition.

Mind feels consistently sharp now vs the cloudy/slow feeling I used to get. Hard to pinpoint the exact cause - probably combination of factors (plus I actually use my brain more now!)

**Currently trying to solve:**

* Effective hair loss treatments
* Better age testing options in Europe
* Optimizing my protocol—please comment if anything jumps out as suboptimal.

1mhgwy2,Biohackers,Functional addict - help with recovery stack,"Hey everyone, long shot but I’m desperate for feedback on my recovery plan. I'm a high-functioning addict working a fulltime job, which makes it hard to quit. 

My usage:

* \>1 year on daily amphetamine (50–150 mg racemic paste, \~50 % purity) every morning
* \>2 years on pregabalin, up to 300 mg. Recently upped to 600mg to feel *something*
* Recent coke binge (1.5 g over two days, zero sleep), then five days clean from stims (Xanax + Lyrica + booze)
* Restarted speed (same batch). My usual dose does nothing, so I upped it to 350 mg oral + 150 mg snorted. Still nothing, just slightly higher HR and BP (120/80 120BPM). Normally, I would reach hypertension grade 1
* Zyprexa (olanzapine) 5 mg nightly for over a month (doctor gave for sleep), and occasional use the two months prior (3-4 times a week). Only now realizing it probably blocked D2/D3 receptors, probably why I've felt so damn apathetic. Don't use anymore
* Snus + coffee daily: caffeine gives a tiny fog-lift, snus doesn't kick like it used to

I’m flat, apathetic, zero motivation, don't do shit at work. Lost interest in everything. I struggle to think, talk, and write. My memory is fucked. I've never felt this dumb before, and it's honestly kinda scary.

And it feels like this just randomly happened. But, when thinking back, I think the downfall slowly started with Zyprexa. It has a half life of about 30 hours, and my last dose was a week ago. Don't feel any improvements yet, and I'm not even sure if it is the main cause. I've felt like shit for a while, but I assumed it was tolerance.

I also think I've semi-fucked myself by using megadoses in an attempt to feel normal 

  
My current stack for recovery is:

* AM: Bromantane 100 mg + N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine 300 mg + Mr.Happy stack + coffee and snus
* Day: Sabroxy, adaptogens, fish oil, D3/K2+C, probiotics
* PM: KSM-66, magnesium, CBD, mirtazapine 15 mg, NAC
* Sleep: 10mg melatonin, occasional use of xanax (try to limit this one)
* Thinking about adding: BPC-157 + TB-500, Semax, Selank, microdosing psilicybin, ketamine (can apparently accelerate the restoration of dopamine receptors) 

What I need help with:

1. Am I completely fucked?
2. Is my stack alright? Missing anything crucial?
3. I have PPAP HCl (interesting compound), phenylpiracetam, could they aid in recovery?
4. I also have MK-677, doesn't hurt to try?
5. Sleep hacks: I hate benzos but can’t sleep. Any alternatives that won't wreck my motivation?

I would like to look normal and stay functional at work while quitting these drugs. I fully understand that I have to slowly taper, eat healthy, sleep, exercise, etc., and I am trying to do that. I know it will suck, but I'm looking for some guidance from fellow biohackers. Brutal honesty, please. What would you do if you were me?

Starting my 4th week in a couple days. Re-ordered so that I can complete 3 months. Planning to do 3mg/day from here on out.

**Benefits:** It’s making a huge difference. I feel so much better.

………………

**Details:**

………………..

Did 1 week low dose 150ug. Then added the daily betaine, b12 & nmn sublingual. 

Then, titrated dose up to 1mg, 2mg, 3mg, 4mg, 5mg, 6mg, 8mg, 10mg, down to 5mg for ~4 days, got a chest twinge today, so will adjust down to 3mg daily for rest of the month.

**Potential confounder:** I took 5mg MOTS-C 5 days ago. I will not take it again until I’ve completed another month of SS-31.

I added it because I was feeling so great & just wondered if I’d get an extra boost. I did not….so maybe my mitochondria aren’t healed enough yet to benefit from mots-c.

**Up next:** already got AOD-9604 in the freezer. Someone said that gave them tons of energy. Will decide between adding that vs MOTS-C after month 2 or 3 of SS-31.


…………………………….

**Original Post:**

Edited same day to add: I took 150ug/day for a week & tried adding these supps in the 2nd week. My mistake in how I initially wrote this.

………..

Like many of you, I tried SS-31 - desperate for a solution to my fatigue.

As usual, after injection of 150ug I definitely could tell that I took something, but over the day, I actually lost energy. I had side-effects.

I started researching & someone else on Reddit found that methyl donors are needed when we take SS-31.

I found this out by 2pm. Took them (because of course I have 1 million supplements from trying to solve my exhaustion) and by 5pm I noticed that I had been getting a lot of physical tasks done.

I had been motoring around & not feeling PEM!

At my worst - a task like washing dishes would take me out for 3 days. (Mentally taxing to follow a boring process because of my adhd & physically exhausting from standing so long).

I see a lot of posts with people having hit or miss results & wanted to share this.

This community has helped me so much. Good luck to you all.

* Methylcobalamin (B12)
* TMG (Betaine Anhydrous)
* NAD+ (I personally had the Renue brand NMN powder that you put under your tongue.)

**Context**

Diagnoses:

* Severe adhd from childhood
* POTS symptoms since ~12 years old. Never officially diagnosed.
* Diagnosed with cfs in 2017 after a sleep study showed no issues & my blood work has always been fine.
* Had Covid 4 times in 2022. Took all the vaccines from 2020/21.
* Through trial & error and finally validated by a Strategene genome report I figured out that my body has glutathione issues.

Through trialing hundreds of supps I found some help in liposomal glutathione under the tongue. (Only the bulletpr00f brand liposomal version works if I swallow the pill.)

This was the first thing that started making me feel better.

Then, I discovered glutamine & ribose (ribose needs Berberine added to prevent dementia risk). Both of these feel like what I think coffee does to “normal” people. Coffee puts me to sleep.

So far SS-31 feels better than those 2. It does feel like the energy is within & like it’s fixing something.

Fingers crossed that it helps my squirrelly adhd brain too!

Notes: yes, I’ve taken all the stimulants, low dose naltrexone, ssri’s and more.

Right now, I’m getting the most benefit from this peptide + glutathione.

I think from COVID after-effects (maybe Long Covid) I was trembling when standing. L-citrulline malate plus beet root powder helped that tremendously.

I spent a crazy amount of time searching reading studies and I came across a concept that changed everything: the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (or TDEE). It's simply how your body burns calories every day. It's divided into 4 parts:

 1. Base Metabolic Rate (BMR) These are the calories you burn just by existing even while sleeping. For your heart to beat your lungs to breathe etc. It's the biggest part! 

2. The Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) It's the energy your body uses to digest what you eat. Yes the simple act of eating burns calories! It's not huge but it counts especially if you eat protein. 

3. Exercise Activity (EAT) That's the sport you do on purpose. Running weightlifting soccer... The obvious part. 

4. THE THING THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING: NEAT It's Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis. Basically ALL the little movements you make without thinking about it: walking to get a coffee, taking the stairs, tinkering, tapping your foot while sitting, grocery shopping... And walking is clearly the major part of NEAT so much so that many studies summarize NEAT as the average number of steps of individuals.

I used a [TDEE Calculator](https://lean-app.com/tdee-calculator/) to have the precise amount of calories I have to eat towards my step number.

And then it clicked. The ""Ah so THAT'S the secret!"". 

I was killing myself at the gym while my NEAT was at zero because I was sitting all day at the office in my car and in front of the TV at night. My body was in ""power saving"" mode 90% of the time. My average step count was terrifying: 2000 steps/day (you can insult me) 

I just started changing some micro things. 

Nothing crazy: 

\- A phone call? I take it while walking in my living room instead of settling on the couch. 

\- I ALWAYS take the stairs. Never the elevator again even for 5 floors. 

\- I purposely park a little further away in the supermarket parking lot. 

\- At the office I set an alarm to get up for 5 minutes every hour. Just to take a few steps. 

\- After lunch I take a short 10-minute walk outside instead of scrolling on my phone. 

And guys... the change was INSANE. In a few weeks without radically changing my meals or adding a single gym session I started to feel different. More energy in the afternoon less brain fog. And yes I lost weight more easily than ever without feeling like I was making a superhuman effort. 

And that's when I understood the link with nutrition. By choosing foods that give me sustained energy (more protein for TEF less fast sugars) I naturally wanted to move more. My body was no longer in ""sugar rush then major crash"" mode. The right nutrition gave me the fuel to increase my NEAT without even thinking about it. Everything is connected! The big revelation is this: Stop thinking in terms of ""1 hour of suffering at the gym"". Think in terms of ""how to be a tiny bit less sedentary all the time"". 

I went from total frustration to a feeling of control I'd never had. And that's thanks to a simple concept that no one ever highlights. They sell us programs powders pills... when the secret was maybe just to track your step count

 Seriously try it. Just for one week. Focus on your NEAT measure it with your step count and your metabolism (BMR). You might be surprised.",2025-07-30 15:27:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1md9lp0/why_99_of_people_are_wrong_about_weight_loss_i/

1mcrnda,Biohackers,Coffee vs caffeine pills: Is one more invigorating for you?,"Do you find that your body responds differently to coffee versus caffeine pills (and soft drinks with added caffeine)?

I know there are compounds in coffee that have additional health impacts beyond the caffeine. What I’m wondering is if you find that there’s something about coffee that makes it more invigorating than taking caffeine in isolation. Again, not asking about which is theoretically more invigorating; I want to know if you can actually feel a difference.

I’m trying the nap hack: Take caffeine right before you fall asleep so that the caffeine kicks in just as you’re ready to wake from your nap. I’m wondering if most people find it just as effective to take a caffeine pill for convenience, or is it is worth making a cup of coffee instead.

FYI, while on the subject: Caffeine sublimes when heat is applied. This means lighter roasts retain more caffeine than darker roasts do. If you want to rock your sleepy little world, go with a blond roast.",2025-07-29 23:57:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mcrnda/coffee_vs_caffeine_pills_is_one_more_invigorating/

Greater alertness in the morning

So the issue with decaf coffee is that the caffeine is actually mold-inhibitory; this makes it even more important to have proper mold testing certificates.

But I can't seem to find a brand that sells CO2-extracted decaf coffee, at least not brands that publicly show their testing results. Anyone here know of one?

One of the most important parts of this has been the change to how I begin my day.  After some light stretching and mindfulness/journalling I typically wait around 60-90 minutes before I have any caffeine, unlike previously where I would consume this straight away and unnecessarily spike my cortisol levels.  I have also started adding Shilajit to my morning coffee after a post I saw on here and I'm starting to feel the benefits, particularly with my focus and clarity.  In addition to coffee I also drink a pint of water with lemon juice and electrolytes, and some mornings I will also drink raw kefir to break my fast.  

I have noticed quite a few benefits, namely my energy and focus has improved along with my gut health, but after what has been a very stressful and tough 6 months for me personally I have noticed that I am dealing so so much better with stresses, anxiety and other trials.  
  
Cleaning up my diet and starting my days with this protocol has made such a difference to my energy and my mental clarity and calmness.  I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone who may be struggling.

1m01dxq,Biohackers,[Australia] Antibiotics Help + Where Can I Get A Full Blood Panel?,"Female. 31. Australia. 

As the title suggests,  I'm looking to have a full blood panel done soon. Where is it possible to have this done in Australia without a doctor looking at you like an idiot.

Also looking for recommendations to build back healthy gut microbiome after a course of antibiotics. 

I had emergency surgery last week on both my hands and they had me on a week of antibiotics, which absolutely cooked me. 

Up until taking the antibiotics I was healthy with only a few health issues, none which truly impeded on my day to day
 (apart from severe debilitating period pain, probably PCOS or endo). 

I finished the course on Sunday, and I'm starting to feel better now but still lethargic. Yesterday I had a migraine attack which is unusual as I take prevention medication which has worked in eradicating 100% of migraines usually. I think the disposition of my gut played a role in the migraine attack. 

I'm eating well. We usually eat the same thing every weeknight just because we are tired from work and study and it's easy for us. It's usually 2-3 Eggs, animal protein (chicken, steak or fish/salmon), kale/spinach, mushrooms and sauerkraut. This is added with salt pepper and a few herbs + spices like paprika, cayenne pepper, oregano. for brekky it's usually just 3 scrambled eggs and a small piece of left over meat from the night before. Some nuts and dried fruit for a snack. Cold pressed carrot tumeric orange juice throughout the day with lots of water. 2x black coffee. Maybe some Kombucha if they are on special lol. Every other day I might have a very small bowl of Greek yoghurt with some honey, nuts, oats and dried fruit but not daily. I have a cup of bone broth every other day also.  I focus on protein and fibre through animal protein and vegetables/fermented veg. 

I have lost 1.5kgs in 1 week. I haven't done anything. I have been in bed recovering. For the most part I've been rocked by the anti biotics so I've been unable to do anything (faint/light headed, nauseous, headaches and a migraine attack, feverish).  

Before hand surgery, I was regular at the steam sauna, 2-4 hour long sessions per week with short 1min ice bath at the 30 min mark. So, contrast therapy if you like. I feel this was a huge part of keeping my overall energy and brain function at a good level, day to day. Something to look forward to at the end of the day at the very least. 

I don't take many supplements tbh. I was a few years back,  but I was having some severe IBS symptoms and as soon as I took a break my symptoms relieved entirely. So now I only take a dose of magnesium daily 400mg and MCT oil with my coffee every other day. I also use alot of olive oil ontop of my plated meals, for the polyphenols. 

I'm trying to shovel down the sauerkraut ATM and have done since starting the antibiotics. I do not like kefir so pls don't recommend it haha.

Bowel cancer, and cancer itself, is prevalent in my family. So I'm extremely aware of that fact and like to take action in my lifestyle to ensure I'm mitigating as much risk as possible especially when it comes to ""gut health"". 

Any recommendations or advice would be appreciated. I'd prefer to include foods to but I'd be happy to look at supplements.

1lxz9os,Biohackers,An Unusual Problem: How to Increase Blood Pressure?,"Hello everyone, I have an unusual problem – most people struggle with high blood pressure. I have a slightly different problem – my pulse pressure ften drops below 40 for more than half an hour during the day. Of course, I drink caffeine, but I get these results even after drinking coffee – I drink two a day.

I've done my own research and unfortunately, I don't see many solutions – creatine monohydrate, increased salt intake, and licorice root. Creatine doesn't seem to work for me, licorice root can increase estrogen and lower testosterone in the long run, and increased salt intake is harmful to the kidneys(?). Did I miss anything?

Low blood pressure isn't usually a problem; I'm active, but pulse around 45-50 might allow me to use some supplements like L-citrulline, which unfortunately causes dizziness for me ;)

EDIT:  
Sorry, let me clarify a bit. I confused blood pressure with pulse. I meant that my pulse drops below 40 beats per minute, but that's associated with relatively low blood pressure. I don't usually experience any dizziness; it's very rare when I eat something that lowers blood pressure—for example, onions. Generally, I don't have any problems with it. This has been going on for years and is working fine. I don't think I need a doctor, as I function quite normally, except for the fact that I can't eat certain foods that lower blood pressure.

1lxm4sb,Biohackers,Long Covid? Recommendations?,"Hi everyone. I got sick a month ago and was really under the weather for a week with continued congestion symptoms for another week and a half after that. Everyone else I know got this same illness going around. Some of my friend said it was Covid because they tested positive for it.

At first I thought I was dealing with bacteria die off after starting methylene blue for a week and increasing the dose but when everyone else got sick I figured it was a coincidence.

I’ve had Covid before and never had any issues with “long covid” but ever since getting sick I’ve just had continued fatigue in a matter in which I’ve never seen before. I’m never someone who has suffered from fatigue, I’m 36 and have always had plenty of enthusiasm and energy. Yet lately I am getting fatigued mid day out of seemingly nowhere and don’t understand why. I am making sure to eat healthy and get plenty of sleep and I started feeling a bit better but it still seems like no matter how much sleep I get it doesn’t seem to carry me through the day the way it would have a month ago.

I thought maybe it’s adrenal fatigue from drinking so much coffee leading up to and during my sickness so I’ve been drinking decaf today but I’ve quit coffee before and never felt this way coming off a coffee binge. 

I’ve even made sure to take high quality d2 and k2, mag l theronate, zinc/copper, and b12 vitamins, and sometimes some small melatonin at night but none of it seems to matter.

One other strange symptom is I believe I am starting to get mild anhedonia as I am feeling generally burnt out and unenthusiastic about things, I am also feeling more irritable and generally more tense the last couple days but maybe that’s caffeine withdrawal?

The only thing I can think at this point is that it must be some variant of long covid or whatever biochemical result of that sort of thing in the body, even if caused by another illness.

I am open to any recommendations. I am going to try and get bloodwork done this week, as I am really starting to suffer here. A week or two of feeling off after illness is one thing but it’s been closer to a month…

1luxgtk,Biohackers,What can I eat if I'm trying to lose Visceral Fat?,"Before you comment, please read!!!!

I am completely aware of the foods that I should not eat. I don't drink alcohol, I'm willing to sacrifice bread and other carbs, I'm drinking only water and coffee, so no fruit juice or soda, and I'm doing my best to eliminate sugar and high calorie foods. 

See the problem? There's so much info on what NOT to eat, but barely anything about what TO eat. It is not worth it to starve myself in order to lose the most dangerous fat of the body. I need to know what is healthy for me to eat that it won't dial back my progress. Because frankly, with all the advice that I hear, it seems the consensus is to starve myself. I need to be able to eat. Life requires sustenance and if I don't eat, I get lightheaded throughout the day. I'm constantly behind the wheel and I can't afford to be lightheaded while driving.

It’s been like this for a few years now, with better and worse periods. Before that, I could wake up at 5 every morning ready and not tired, even with little sleep. 

I go to bed at 9:15 every night, with 45 minutes of reading/talking with my wife. I wake up at 5:15, giving me 7 hours of sleep. This is consistent weekends and weekdays. 

I walk my dog and bike to work, so I exercise every morning, eat a healthy diet of more or less only home cooked meals, focusing on veggies and protein. I only drink coffee til 3 or 4 in the afternoon. 

Water a plenty, some kind of exercise every day after work. Stand at my desk as much as possible.

So just have no clue what to eat in the morning, everything puts me to sleep. I've lived this long on just coffee + oat milk + sugar as my breakfast from 9 to 2pm which is the least conflicting but still makes my stomach grumble from reaction. 

I've tried one slice of seeded bread with peanut butter and sugar free jam, gives me tension in my head and makes me drowsy. 

Tried toast with eggs and avocado, eggs out me to sleep. Any protein in fact does even out of breakfast, a protein bar or shake does the same thing. 

Can't have fruits, they give me upset stomach and I'm allergic to most. Intolerant to bananas. 

Tried light portion meals you'd have for dinner but for breakfast such as some meat, roasted potatoes or salmon etc, it doesn't make me as sleepy but digging into strong foods like that gives me a bit of a stomach age. 

Cereal just puts me to sleep, sugary or not. 

So yeah, no idea what to do but starve. Any neutral, simple breakfasts you guys could list for me to try? ",2025-07-08 01:31:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1luc2u8/breakfast_that_doesnt_make_me_sleepy/

1lr0dwa,Biohackers,Not following your brain rhythm might be draining your energy,"As a cognitive scientist, I’ve spent the past few years digging into what helps the brain sustain high performance, not just in the moment, but over months and years. 

One pattern keeps showing up: most people push through mental fatigue without realizing it’s part of a natural biological cycle, not a flaw.

The brain follows predictable cycles of alertness and recovery (called ultradian rhythms), typically every 90–120 minutes. When we ignore those dips and power through with coffee, stimulants, etc. we overload the brain’s recovery systems. 

Over time, that can reduce cognitive flexibility.

I’ve been working on ways to help people tune into these cycles more precisely (e.g., like tracking sleep, HRV) and found that you can forecast when your brain is primed for deep focus and when it’s better to rest with just a couple minutes of cognitive testing per day.

I’ve been experimenting with ways to track these rhythms more precisely including a tool I’ve been developing that uses games to forecast peaks and dips. It's been eye-opening to see how much sharper I feel just by syncing my day to my brain’s actual rhythm. 

Curious if anyone else here is measuring or tracking anything similar? Any tool recs out there?

1lr0cws,Biohackers,Withdrawal is becoming a way of life,"A couple years ago I had the idea to quit using social media. I was shocked to find that when I had deleted all the apps from my phone, and logged out of all my browser sessions, that I began to experience textbook withdrawal. Symptoms like anxiety, irritability, insomnia, cravings, and brain fog.

After a few months the symptoms had subsided enough, so I decided to go ahead and quit coffee too. And wow, wouldn't you know it, that decision landed me right back in withdrawal country. 

Now, don't get me wrong. These were positive decisions which I stand by. It's just amazing to me how my life as a modern American has left me booby trapped with triggers that can send me plunging right back into withdrawal at any time.

I'm sitting here in withdrawal as I write this. Because last week I caught on to this compulsive snacking issue that I had. I think it was some kind of maladaptive coping strategy that I picked up when I was young.

Leading up to last week I would have thought that I was living a healthy and relatively strict, productive lifestyle. That nasty snacking habit was hiding in plain sight.

Anyways, I guess it's better to be in withdrawal now than to experience the long term consequences of keeping those bad habits.",2025-07-03 20:43:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1lr0cws/withdrawal_is_becoming_a_way_of_life/

Hey everyone —

It’s been a while since my last update here. Some of you might remember when I first shared this app, it was just a little side project I built for myself, and your feedback totally blew me away. Your comments and DMs motivated me to take this way further than I originally planned (over 10k people have downloaded it now, which blows my mind)

Over the past weeks, I’ve been putting in **dozens of hours** to build and test two big new features I think you’ll like:

# New: Timeline View

You now get a visual timeline of your day, with supplements placed smartly around anchors like **breakfast, lunch, bedtime**, etc.

More anchors are coming soon — like **workout**, **coffee…**

For each supplement, you get an explanation of **why** it’s placed there — based on its ideal timing, synergy, interactions, and your fasting/eating windows.

We’ve done tons of testing and the AI model is pretty damn accurate.

But, if you notice weird stuff in your stack, please tell me  
Even small bug reports or misplacements help a *lot* to improve the engine.

# New: Nutrient Checkup

This one I’m really excited about.

We built a little system to estimate your **probability of deficiencies** in 18 nutrients — based on lifestyle, diet, sun exposure, training, etc.  
All backed by studies we compiled over the past weeks.

Not every nutrient can be estimated like this (Selenium or Iron? too tricky, you need a blood test).

But things like **Magnesium, Omega-3, Vitamin D**? The quizz is pretty solid to build a *good first guess*.  
Of course, this doesn’t replace a real test — but most people never get tested anyway. So this is a great way to **ask better questions**, explore **which areas to watch**, and maybe **know where to supplement or test further**.

I loved building this — spent hours reading papers, and brainstorming with the small team I’m slowly assembling behind the app!

# Coming next:

**Correlation: supplements vs well-being**

Right now you can log your supplement intake daily.  
Soon, you’ll be able to track things like **sleep quality, focus, motivation, mood, energy**, and we’ll start surfacing correlations (ex: “on days with magnesium, you sleep 14% better”).

This will take some time — I’m exploring things like syncing with Apple Health or maybe even Whoop. No promises yet, it’s a bit complex on the dev side, but I’d love to go in that direction if I can.

The supplement database is growing fast — we’re close to 100 now. If something you take isn’t there, drop it in the comments or send me a message, I’ll add it in.



That’s it for now — just wanted to show you where things are at.  
This sub has been one of the biggest drivers behind the app.  
A bunch of you gave me killer ideas, some even helped debug and test early versions  
So yeah — thank you

If you’ve got questions, thoughts, or feedback — drop them below, I’m all ears.

1lo302g,Biohackers,My current full routine - in details!,"Hi everyone,

I spent years exploring supplements, training and various stuff, and I think i finally found something that works well for me - energy and health wise, so I thought it might be interesting to share.

**1) The diet -** the idea is to be metabolically healthy, as well feed the gut microbiome with a diversity of stuff.

My diet is quite simple. Breakfast is composed of oats, whey isolat, EVOO, green tea, and cocoa with high polyphenols. I'll often add a bowl of frozen red fruits.

Lunch is a bit bland: steamed sweet potato with EVOO, crushed gralic, some spices and lemon juices. I then cook either fish, 5% fat ground beef or chicken breast.

Evening will consist of a protein (mostly low fat meat), a salad that includes raw white onions, some beans, a slice of high fiber bread, and I usually finish with a bowl of skyr and some honey.

I'll do a cheat meal 2 times a week, that I optimize usually by doing stuff like removing the fries when i'm eating burgers or stuff like that.

**2) The training**

I believe that training should go in all directions, so I try to integrate a bit of everything, in 10 days sessions, with:  
\- 5 sessions of weighlifting, with a mix of strength / close to 1RM, high reps / low rest, plyometrics. I do a mix of compound exercise (bench/squat/DL), bodyweight exercises, mixed with some more ""practical"" exercise like carrying heavy stuff, farmer walk, medecine ball throw, etc. 

\- 3 sessions of cardio: I do either zone 2 if i'm too tired, or thai boxing on the bag with a lot of intervals, which allows me to maintain my flexibility, explosiveness, and work on coordination, which are key. I add some hill sprints from time to time.

\- Stretching: every day of training means at least 5 min of stretching a bit later, more if you feel pain or discomfort.

**3) The supplements - full protocol**  
  
\- A complete multivitamin that integrates Vit D+K2, zinc, selenium  
\- Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Astaxanthin  
\- Lycopene  
\- Longevity Mix - L-Theanine, Taurine, CaAKG, Creatine Monohydrate, Glycine,  reduced Glutathione, Hyaluronic Acid, Magnesium; I used to take those separately but when for it because it was more practical. Both work as well from my POV.  
\- Fish oil with low TOTOX score  
\- 3g of aged garlic extract  
\- 2-3g of ginger powder  
\- 10g of collagen peptides  
\- Prebiotics: 3g of *Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)* \+ 3g of 2’-fucosyllactose, a prebiotic derived from human milk with a lot of interesting effects on metabolism & cognition  
\- 10g of psyllium husk, taken away from supplements, for gut/lipids  
\- Cialis: 5mg twice a week (cool gym pump, boner, longevity effects, estrogen management)  
\- Matcha green tea + high polyphenols cocoa (included in diet)  
\- Unlimited coffee until noon, no more after

When I feel a bit tired/ out fit, i'll throw in some adaptogens like ginseng + rodhiola for a few days; I cycle them super quickly and don't take them more than 5 days. I use high doses for the ginseng. It works very well when you need a quick boost.

**4) Other stuff**

\- I do cold bath / cold shower, with a simple rule: no more than twice a week, and do it when my mind thinks it the worst time to (except when sick of course). Meaning - when i feel bad/tired/stressed/in pain, that's when i'll force myself to do a cold shower, to reset stuff psychologically, and lower inflammation. Usually 3-5 min under it.

\- I do PRP **Platelet-rich plasma therapy**, for a few years, to heal training injuries, improve my skin and overall prevent any wear and tear. I do a 1-2 session every 4 to 6 month.

\- Skin care is pretty basic, moisturizer in morning and evening. 

  
**What's next ?**

Supplement wise, I don't see anything worth adding, i'm of course open to suggestions. Diet wise I would like to eat more fish but harder to manage than meat. 

Other biohacking stuff i'm planning to add would be Red Light therapy, HBOT, Sauna. ",2025-06-30 09:20:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1lo302g/my_current_full_routine_in_details/

1ln4el6,Biohackers,Any CAFFEINE experts here? Chime in.,"Friends,

I'm trying to get to the bottom of my sinus tachycardia episodes, focusing on my caffeine intake 

Basics:

- chocolate junkie (but have cut down drastically)

- used to drink 2 Lungo sized cups daily (65mg of caffeine, 1 at 10am and 2nd around 530-6pm before exercise, total 130mg per day). I've cut this down to literally maybe 2x a week with an occasional ""fun coffee drink""

Episodes

- 1st ER visit this yr: possible tachycardia due to coffee (according to my log I did exercise that day which is my habit). Had my episode 5hrs later, thankfully everything was fine

- 2nd ER visit. Inconclusive because I likely had an anxiety attack. This was just 3 days later after the 1st ER visit. Nothing found but high possibility I drank coffee at 9-10am. Went to the ER around 1-2pm, perhaps 4 hrs after my coffee intake

- 3rd ER visit. Unfortunately there's no evidence I exercised that day, but still possible I had my morning coffee and a late afternoon one. Went to the ER at 11pm which sort of correlates to around the same time as my 1st ~ 5-6hrs later

- after my 3rd ER visit, Ive made an effort to go cold turkey for at least 2 weeks. I've been doing my 2-3x a week intake since

Yesterday I had an episode. Had a latte which apparently has an espresso shot at around 830am. My episode happened at 230pm, around 6hrs later after my intake

My assumption:

I've been drinking coffee twice a day for a long time. Is it possible my body isn't metabolizing it quickly enough anymore? Noticed that the effects only kick in 4-6hrs after my intake

I have great difficulty focusing on mundane tasks, I misplace my phone and keys on a daily basis - good old scatter brain in action. I really struggle at work to stay focused for 40 hours a week doing things I don’t want to do. 

Everyone else seems to be relatively happy and oblivious to life’s obstacles, sometimes it feels like my brain is going 1000 miles an hour with multiple thought streams going on. 

Here is a list of things I’ve tried that have no effect on me what so ever. 

Modafinil - makes me feel slightly more awake for 2 hours then a horrible crash with severe fatigue for the rest of the day 

Caffeine - I can quite easily consume up to 600mg a day with no effects. I can drink a strong coffee and go to sleep 5 minutes later 

Ashgawanda KSM66 - 600mg a day for a month, no effects

Agmatine sulfate - varying doses from 200mg - 2000mg. No effects 

Phenethylamine - Up to 1500mg in one dose, no effects. I am aware it is broken down rapidly but hesitant to pair with a MAO-B inhibitor such as selegiline due to risk of hypertension. 

Pseudoephedrine - for motivation / concentration purposes. First time I ever tried it I took 120mg and felt like a veil had been lifted, I felt focused, at ease and content. Subsequent doses of up to 240mg spread throughout the day seemingly have no effects, apart from making me sweat and feel hot. 

Creatine - for its reported cognitive effects. No effects at doses of up to 20g a day spread out. But excellent for my weight training.

Nicotine - in gum form as I despise smoking. Did nothing for concentration, just gave me a nicotine addiction instead which I relapse from on and off. Can go months without any then one day I fancy some and buy it, even though it doesn’t do anything to me. 

Magnesium - in various forms - no effects 

L-Theanine - on its own and paired with caffeine up to 500mg. No effects 

Can anyone shed light what the hell is going on here. How can I be immune to all supplements when others report they work, is it just the placebo effect in action ? 

Are there any supplements you recommend I try to treat said symptoms. I just want to be able to get through a working day without it being a battle to stay focused on the task at hand

1mu2w09,Supplements,Maca for males,"I’ve recently started taking black Maca and really enjoy it. Initially, I took it for its libido-boosting properties, but it’s helped me even more with my energy levels. I drink less coffee now and have clean energy throughout the day. It has also really helped with my anxiety and depression.

My only concern is that it might raise estrogen. I see a lot of women taking it for menopause issues and surprisingly fewer men using it in general. I’ve been on SSRIs for a long time, and the last thing I want is to lower my testosterone even further.

1mtmp21,Supplements,Supplement stack help?,"Hey guys, new to working out/biohacking/supplements. Have a lot more time and stability lately so I've gotten more into my health. I've always been relatively healthy and done light exercise, but only started taking things more seriously about a month agao. Right now I'm taking the following 5 core supplements, which I started about a week ago:

Creatine (5g in the AM, with coffee)
D3 + K2 (125/100mcg)
Algae Oil (2 gels, 715mg)
Taurine (1000mg in afternoon)
Magnesium Glycinate (200mg in afternoon, 200mg 1 hour before bed)

And I just added yesterday:

L-Theanine (200mg in the AM) for the jitters in the morning from the caffeine.

I've been looking at:

Probiotic (have some gastro issues, always have)
Life Extension 2 Per Day/Health Booster (in place of a multi, also looking at their NAD+)
Tongkat Ali (feel like I may have low T, but not yet clinically validated. This seems like the safest option to rotate in)
CDP-Choline (cognitive function, I experience some brain fog)
Berberine (comes as a recommended longevity supplement)

For extra information, I'm 26 years old. Male, 5'9"" and about 150lbs. Lean, some muscle. Looking to stay lean but tone more and add some muscle (though this will be most training/diet). Goal with supplements is mainly just to cover any possible deficiencies, increase my overall energy (and libido), live a longer life, and mostly just feel ""healthier"". I want to be prepared to tackle whatever life throws at me, physically and mentally. I also strongly value my supplements being as evidence-backed as possible (less pseudo-science).

So, do we think I'm off to a good start with my current 5? I certainly feel better than before I took them as far as energy goes (mostly due to getting much better sleep I presume), but I'm not sure if the other things I'm looking at would slot in well for me or are considered overkill. I plan to give this core setup a bit more time so I can be sure it works well for me and then add the others gradually. Any suggestions to round this out? 

Any other tips are also welcome for a beginner!",2025-08-18 13:53:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mtmp21/supplement_stack_help/

1mq1csw,Supplements,gaba supplement vs. alcohol,"yesterday i drank half a 40 of rye whiskey.  after realizing the bottle was almost gone i decided to try my gaba pills for the first time ever.  mainly as a test and cause i've been curious about these for years and i was too lazy to walk to the liquor store.

my original research was following what others have said about gaba not being readily available to pass the blood brain barrier.  what i didn't know about was it being absorbed by the enteric nervous system and your stomach.  after my shower yesterday i already felt better from 1 x 600mg gaba pill vs. what a few shots would've done.  i took another pill a couple hours later and was incredibly relaxed and just in an overall state of ease.  granted there was still alcohol in my system but i didn't bother finishing the bottle which is what i was prepared to do if there was no effect from gaba supplementation.

ordinarily upon waking up i would love to pour a stiff drink, just to immediately kill anxiety.  yet, today i didn't even really feel the need or desire.  took another gaba pill with my morning coffee and some magnesium and it's startling how well it actually works.  like this supplement just switched the worry button off, and it's far more effective than theanine even.

i will see if i can refrain from alcohol for a few more days just to experiment around with these pills and save my money.  if anyone's looking for a reason to try gaba, i would say do it.  it's already helping me avoid alcohol which is a huge bonus to not slowly destroy my mind and body",2025-08-14 13:54:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mq1csw/gaba_supplement_vs_alcohol/

I'm 34F, after 2 years of 100mg sertraline daily, I started tapering off for the past 6 months. I was tapering off very slowly and had my last dose of 12mg about a month ago.

However, about 2 weeks ago I started being EXTREMLY tired, I mean never in my life have I been that tired. I work 8-5 office job and I am not able to focus at all until 11am even then I struggle, then I get a crash again around 2 pm.

I had to take off today as I had to go back to bed, I can't concentrate and my job requires studying. I struggle to read even 1 page paper.

Today, slept 8 h, woke up as if someone was beating me whole night. I had breakdast and a strong coffee, but barely keeping my eyelids up.

I have to work. I can't take off days nor sick leave, ran out of them.

Please, please is there aby supplement that can help me with focus/concetration and more energy even a little? I just need to be able to work until this thing goes away.

2. If you were interested, would you prefer this marketed as a fun, lifestyle coffee brand (like flavored iced coffee vibes) or a masculine, gym performance style brand? Why?

1mngnpe,Supplements,Which Neurotransmitters?,Hey all. I am trying to solve this puzzle and would appreciate any supplement or diet advice you can give. I have been a coffee drinker for 8 years now. My standard 'dose' is one cup each day. If i do 2 cups for a day I feel amazing and almost on top of the world. But the next day I am depressed and deflated until I have my second cup again. My tolerance gets reset to 2 cups and I go through a depressing withdrawal until I normalize back down to 1 cup per day. I hate the depression but I want to feel alive everyday. I understand that this has somewhat to do with dopamine as ive taken dopamine supplements and did not get same high but did get the horrible withdrawal depression. I took bocopa puriens and didn't feel any different until I stopped taking them the next day and felt horribly depressed. So is it acetylcholine? Norepinephrine? Epinephrine? I went through 3 to 4 SSRI's 3 years ago and they all ruined my life making me a vegetable that was so depressed and overwhelmed. Im not that way anymore but I am back to a baseline that still sucks. When I eat eggs I feel awesome and super productive but I am not in the mood to be sociable and feel also meaningless except to get work done or progress to the next thing. I have a slow comt gene so I am likely sensitive to stimulants and too much acetylcholine activity. Even 1 egg gives me have choline depression. I can't have eggs anyway as my GI doesn't tolerate them unfortunately. I can't do much dairy as I might be intolerant from the miserable symptoms that come from consuming it. If i eat chicken or turkey I get sluggish likely from the tryptophan and I feel lifeless similarly to taking the SSRI's. My goal is to not wakeup feeling unmotivated and depressed. Caffeine and eggs have been my only 'highs' other than the different 'high' that alcohol gives. Its a vicious cycle and I want to have a normal level of neurotransmitters like people that seem to have a stable happy life. Any advice is welcome.

I’ve tracked it with the 8Sleep mattress over a few months, and it’s working pretty well.

Curious about your routines… anything mi missing?

•  300mcg of melatonin (bump to 600mcg if I’m up past midnight). Sticks close to what the body produces naturally

•  Magnesium glycinate and about 2-3g of glycine during the day/early evening. Glycine for GABA, neuroprotection, glutathione production. 

•  If I had stimulants late in the day, like coffee or occasional low-dose nicotine stuff, I throw in 25mg CBD to help bring REM back up. It counters the disruption super well. 

•  Lastly if I have an off day, bad day at the gym, a drink or two socially, I use 200mg of an herbal mix with valerian root, chamomile (for the apigenin), lemon balm, and passionflower. All GABA inducing antioxidants & mild sedatives that increase sleep efficiency boosting DEEP/REM even on a night with 6 hours of sleep.

1m4j1ui,Supplements,"Chronically low blood pressure, worse in summer. Need your advice!","Hi there everyone!   
  
I’ve always had low blood pressure, around 45/75 and max 60/90 and it gets much worse in the summer. I feel weak, especially in my head: heavy feeling, pressure around the temples, and eye movement feels slow. When I stand up, I get the usual 10 seconds of dizziness/confusion. I avoid roller coasters or anything intense because I’d probably faint.

I eat clean, low-salt meals but add 3g of pure salt daily (1.5g at lunch and dinner). I take 20ml of olive oil with each meal for extra calories and 1g of creatine on training days (3x/week). I’ve tried licorice and coffee, they gave me weird adrenaline-like stomach sensations, so I stopped.

Should I increase salt? (I've always thought it could be dangerous for veins and blood health.  
Try another supplement?   
Any drug medications?

  
**This is really affecting my daily life.**

 I’ve been addicted to coffee since I was like 13, I’m from Italy and honestly it’s just normal here. Everyone drinks espresso, it’s not even seen as a big deal. I usually have like 3-4 a day easy.

Lately I’ve been feeling a bit too wired though, especially on game days (I play football), so I tried switching it up and grabbed a guarana supplement just to see.

Weirdly… I actually like it more. It’s still got the caffeine but it hits way smoother. I feel more focused during matches, like my head’s clearer and I’m not all jumpy or overthinking.

I wasn’t expecting to notice anything, honestly. Thought it’d just be “plant caffeine lol”, but now I’m kinda into it.

1lujgax,Supplements,Caffeine = Fatigue and mood issues.,"Anyone else just feel tired and sluggish from caffeine?

I love coffee and drink a few cups everyday. I'm down to 1 cup of caffeineated coffee daily. I never noticed just how sh*tty caffeine was making me feel though. I would knock back 4-5 cups daily and was a walking zombie for years.

I just drink decaf now and use cup of normal coffee to feed my addictive personality. I also can't stand the caffeine withdrawals. Man those headaches are rough. 

Is this usually a sign of an issue? ADHD type of issue? I've never been tested for it but I suspect I do. 

What else is worth swapping over to that can cause some mild stimulation but not that horrid crash?

I am currently working off the caffeine. Each day I lower my teaspoonful by a tiny amount. Be nice to find a replacement though without the sluggishness?

In the past 3 months ever since I had my colonoscopy and quit Lexapro I have also noticed a seemingly paradoxical affect from B  vitamins.  I have taken them in my multis for 10 years, but now some cause extreme insomnia and others cause that insane panic I referred to above. 

Its happened a few times and I'm now making the connection. 
One day I took just my riboflavin because I wanted to keep taking it for migraine prevention, about 2 hours later I was in my bed freaking out. 
This happened a few other times, B6 was involved sometimes as well iirc and I circle back to the hospital visit, I realized when discharged that I took a Starbucks energy coffee drink, got home to check and it has B2, Niacin and B6.

Pushing my doc currently for a blood test related to B vitamins to see, in the meantime drinking a lot of water. The experience is so extremely unpleasant and I'm still very on edge.

Each morning, I take 1 gram of L-carnitine tartrate on an empty stomach before my run and gym workout. I usually only have about 8 oz of coconut water for electrolytes, along with some water, and occasionally coffee if needed.

After my workout, I’ll come home and eat a baked sweet potato — sometimes two — as a source of carbs. For the rest of the day, I typically consume around 1,000 additional calories and try to stay under 1,500 total calories per day. At night, I take 1g regular L-carnitine (not the tartrate version).

I also take a garlic powder supplement for its allicin content, primarily to help manage TMAO levels. I am also taking all of them orally.

The problem is I don’t feel full eating fruits and veg and plain rice or chicken and stuff like this. I can do it for part of the day, even when eating big portions, then I literally feel starved. I don’t like brown bread and plain stuff. I need salt and sugar, sauces and cheese, red meat. I really don’t know how people do it, especially long term. I crave chocolate, pasta, pizza etc.. I’m not even talking about diet, simply modifying my habits to eat “clean” and avoid junk food. Is this normal? I feel like I’m the only person who can’t do it even if I put my mind to it. Example of what I eat in a day: Coffee (with milk & sugar) Porridge for breakfast or Greek yogurt Piece of fruit or a handful of nuts for a snack Large portion of rice with chicken or tuna, or even pasta with a home cooked sauce By 5pm when I get home I’m literally starving. Like to the point I get stomach cramps or headaches. By late afternoon I can’t do healthy anymore and I put a pizza in the oven or have a burger and chips and some chocolate.

1l51kx4,healthyeating,Low-acidic healthy food/recipe help,"TLDR: my healthy diet was apparently strongly hinging on my ability to handle acid, which I no longer can. Struggling, need tips. 

Hi y’all. While this sounds a little obnoxious to say, I’ve never really struggled with my diet before since I love healthy foods. I love baking and desserts, too, so I have to watch that, but otherwise I’m good. Lots of salads, homemade soups, meat and few times a week (fish and fowl only), black coffee and tea, etc. 

Then, I got cancer and while I’ve finished treatment and should be “back to normal”, I’ve discovered that I can no longer tolerate acidic food/drink. I hadn’t realized it, but all the healthy dishes I love rely on acid to keep them tasty: I used to use balsamic vinegar + olive oil as a salad dressing (sometimes w/out the oil even). Most of my homemade soups/stews were tomato-based bc they’re cheap and easy. I never added anything to my coffee or black teas and always thought green teas were mild. I’d add fresh lemon juice to my food often as a way of reducing salt content w/out sacrificing flavor. I could keep going but you get the idea; I took for granted how much I relied on acid to make my food tasty. 

Now, over time, I’m gaining weight and noticing my diet isn’t as healthy. I can only use creamy salad dressings, eat cream-based soups, and take my caffeinated beverages w/ creamer. I add cheese to things more often now because I find I’m more likely to tolerate the dish — same goes for bread. I’ve tried to mitigate where I can (thank you vegan recipes!) but it often feels like my food can now be healthy + tasteless or less healthy/more processed + taste good.

1ifgjls,healthyeating,Organised but boring,"For the first time ever I have sorted out my eating so that it’s healthy and easy. I put all the foods I’m eating into Cronometer and pleasantly found out I wasn’t missing out on any nutrients so I was very happy with that!

The only problem is that it’s very basic!! It goes like this…

For starchy carbs:-
Cook a massive batch of white rice and keep 4 portions to eat and freeze another 12 x 150g portions for the rest of the month. This is made the Persian way so it is very tasty rice!
Cook a batch of baby potatoes twice a week which gives me 8 portions.

For protein:-
Rump steak
Chicken breast
Venison steak
Tuna steak
Wild caught salmon

For veggies:-
Frozen bags of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, peas etc etc all take 5 mins to defrost.

Breakfast mon - Fri:-
Prep 5 x overnight oats with:- oats, milk, yogurt, kefir, chia seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, goji berries, sesame seeds, scoop of whey, salt.

Lunch mon - Thu:-
Prep 4 x pasta salad (3 variations - tuna, chicken, egg)

Breakfast weekends:-
Scrambled eggs on toast with a protein shake

Lunch wekends:-
Have carbs, protein, veggies mix and match from above.

Morning supplements:-
500ml water with 5g creative + ELMT electrolytes

Evening supplements:-
2 x omega 3 tabs
1 x vit d tab

2 black coffees a day.

Protein shake and banana if my workout doesn’t fall before a meal time.

Exercise routine:-
Mon - lower strength training (alternating between heavy weights and low weights each month)
Tue - upper strength training (same as above)
Wed - treadmill sprints
Thu - long zone 2 run
Fri - rest
Sat - limb strength training (biceps, triceps, calf’s, neck)
Sun - rest

I’ve got myself into such a routine I can knock up a healthy meal, eat and clean up in less than half an hour.

I’ve been through the motions with diets and have tried keto, carnivore and other particular diets, but now I’m very balanced I hit the following macros:-
Protein 200g
Carbs 150g
Fat 80g
Something along them lines it ends up being about 2100 calories a day, this has resulted in about 8kg lost in two months, I’m very pleased with that!

I put the success down to the fact I finally made myself responsible for my own diet, rather than expecting my wife to keep up with my requirements (which hasn’t gone down well in the past).

I went round a neighbours for dinner last night and had a few beers, some lovely food and a bit of dessert all guilt free because of how well I’m doing and how confident I am of getting back on the wagon the next day!

Anyways, this is all great, but I need to make the menu a bit more exciting and varied without making it harder and less likely for me to stick to my good ways!! 

Any ideas?",2025-02-01 21:13:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1ifgjls/organised_but_boring/

its like your brain 🧠 is making and forcing you to have a huge smile and feel very euphoric and happy. 😀

Because these are two completely different things !! 

And it’s like you don’t really have any control at all whether to smile or not !!

====_______________====

So Food gave me happiness, joy with smile that lasted for 30 min !! That probably nothing in my life gave me this is really shocking to me

Even substances like Wxxx, alcxxxx , nicotine, Caffiene didn’t give me a that level of happiness that meal gave me that day … !!

I am really impressed and shocked as well … !! 😅


======____________====== 

With good sleep, The day is tremendously better than my normal day for my mood … and I love it ❤️    With those things !!

Cold shower , Coffee , Dark Chocolates 88-92% , avocado , banana, pumpkin seeds , beef or steak , eggs , olives oil, green leafy and vegetable salad, jogging or Running. Omega 3 oil and vitamin D3 supplements 

The best days I felt in this year was a combination of those to be in my day !!

====_______________====

First Question:

So why it does have this effect on me ?! And what are neurotransmitters are more likely involved in this one ?! 

====_______________====

Second Question ; 

Does avocado have vitamins and micro nutrients that I am more likely deficient in … and is that the reason I am feeling the effect more so or not ?! Or are these effect happening to everyone when they eat avocado 🥑 ?!

Because if that is the case I will try to use supplement or focus more on getting it from my diet ?!

1caelpq,healthyeating,"Rate my diet (18M, 178cm, need to bulk)","When I was little I always had a very low appetite and there were days where I was ""able"" to eat a single moderate meal+when I started working out I had a chaotic workout program, not having a single pause between sets (chest->back->legs, repeat), that insane cardio and that low calorie intake (they surely were days where I had under 1000kcal per day) led to me having very little mass. October 2023 I had only 54kg, I tried donating blood but wasn't able to, I had already tried bulking for the past year to some extend, but that event really hit a spark in me.

Fast forward, I really ate a lot per day, not necessarily a good, diverse diet, but it still was lot, so much that there were several days when I was feeling like vomiting, and I currently have 59kg, although at the beggining of 58kg the progress got really, really slowed. Point is, things with a lot of calories from simple sugars REALLY affected my overall mood and thinking for certain periods, for that reason, I limited my simple sugars to strictly natural sources, occasionally honey. I also remarked that junk food which contained MSG, unhealthy fat and others additives made me crave them into more, temporary impairing my thinking and clearance of mind.

Apart from sugar and addictive additives which I already know created cravings, therefore impairing my clearance of mind and mood, I started feeling in a lot of horrible ways, and I suspected it was from some kind of vitamin deficiency. I started taking a lot of supplements (feeling that especially Omega-3 and Ashwaganda helped the most) and concentrated more on taking protein after work-outs and having a good amount of protein per day.

My ""plan"" was this, please critique it as much as there is to critique:  
So, apart from high-calorie junk-food, eating to gain weight would also mean getting more body-fat, which isn't what I really wanted since I barely made out of the skinny-fat problem two years ago, plus I run, a lot, so more body fat wouldn't benefit me too much. I researched about what happens with extra-protein and when would it be considered ""extra"", and I drawed the conclusion that while my first interest was to gain weight, I would rather like not gaining useless body fat while feeling horrible and then do a cut, but just increase the muscle mass. Muscle density is higher than body fat density, therefore my overall volume can be the same, but with more mass. Therefore there are several days where I take 100g+ of protein per day, usually the days when I work out, even though it can be just 2 sets.

Currently, I am happy with my diet of 2000kcal+ per day, 80g of protein+ per day, no junk food and no added sugar, also no feeling horrible for whatever reason, but is it enough, is it too much, and can it potentially lead me to any long-term problems?

Diet:  
-daily  
2-3 eggs in the breakfast with varying type of bread, alternating the cooking oil with EV Coconut oil, EV Olive Oil and animal fat if available (sometimes with dill, parsley and tomatoes)  
50-100g of nuts per day (either pure nut butter from almonds, cashews and hazelnuts, either simple nuts as snacks, including pumpkin and sunflower seeds)  
600ml-800ml of milk per day/kefir  
50g of whey protein/casein (with added bromelain and digestive enzymes)  
50-100g of sorghum porridge  
2g of grounded cinnamon (in the protein shake)

-some times per week  
meat, mostly poultry, rarely red meat  
fruits, especially bananas and citrus  
teas, mostly white tea and other real teas, occasionally herbal  
cereals and wholegrains other than sorghumchia seeds  
any kind of cheese  
honey in coffee or tea

-some times per month  
potatoes (in any way)  
chicken soup, usually with organs  
if in need of flour to cook something, chickpea flour  
mac and cheese with a personalized mix which includes nutritional yeast  
mung beans  
white rice  
whatever my parents make me, usually meat with some kind of side dish with legumes or pasta

Supplements:  
Omega-3 (daily)  
Vitamin D (daily)  
Multivitamin (C, E, B1,2,3,5,6,7,9,12 , Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, Selenium) (sometimes per week)  
Ashwaganda (daily)  
Chlorella (I take 1-3 times per week, to detox the possible heavy metals from the diet or supplementation)

I drink a lot of water daily, also I have no digestive problems, the digestive enzymes, kefir and sorghum porridge takes care of the hardship of digesting fats.

Is there something I am missing in my diet? Will I have any long-term problems with the current diet I have?  
I saw that what I mostly spam for calories has the negative impact on weight gain, leading to other types of problems, but does it apply when I was severely underweight to begin with?

1c4i04n,healthyeating,Where can I start eating healthy/changing lifestyle?,"Hey,

  
I wanna change my eating habits a bit, but I would like to ask you guys some questions. Just some backgrounds to understand my questions a bit more clearly. I am 29, quite tall (190/6'3) a bit above of average in weight (100-105kg)compared my height, have some muscle and physically kind of active, as walk a lot and train weekly 3-4 times. When I was 18 I was pretty fat, I came down from 165(kgs) to 90(kgs) and since then my blood sugar, cholesteryn and a lot of my similar stats have changed in the good way. 

  
Lately I have just noticed my energy level (especially on the morning) is pretty low, even though use to sleep good. And btw, never smoked, since I dont like alcohol I dont drink at all (except cola), and (that is probably the weirdest) I do not drink coffee at all. But here is my questions. 

  
1, What does actually mean to eat healthy? - I tried to look up on the internet but site by site recommended different food with some mutuals (like Kale, Quinoa, fish). I grew up on near to the Balkan and people said and believed like vegetables, fruits and meat as healthy. But for example a lot of sites on the internet don't even recommend red meat, while some body builder influencers only eat red meat to get healthy(carnivore diet for example). So for these reasons I am a bit confused. I started to eat Apple and orange every breakfast, instead of sandwiches and bacon. And try to eat more fish and lean meat with steamed vegetables instead of rice.

  
2, Why some sites only recommend water as the only one drink I can pote? - This is my worst habit, I barely find the water potable. If i drink it, it is some mineral water (but as far as I know European companies they probably sell tap water with label). My favorite drink is a type of cola, that contains absolute zero sugar, but for exchange it has ASPARTAME in it. I have the same problem as I have in the previous question. Some sites says it is worse than sugar, some says it is good for a certain daily limit. 

  
3, What does absolutely recommended to cut out/avoid from my diet? - For example for years I ate sandwiches for breakfast, and nowadays when I started to read healthy eating articles and white bread is not recommended at all.

17neg9b,healthyeating,Why Low Acid Coffee Is Your Gentle Brew Companion,"**Hello Everyone**  


**Did You know what is benefit of drinking  Low-Acid Coffee** 

 Low-acid coffee, also known as ""smooth"" or ""mellow"" coffee, offers a multitude of benefits that can be quite appealing to coffee lovers. Let's delve into the world of low-acid coffee and explore its advantages.  
**Why Choose Low-Acid Coffee?**  
Imagine this: You wake up in the morning, craving a cup of coffee, but you're prone to acid reflux, heartburn, or a sensitive stomach. The usual acidic brew can wreak havoc on your digestive system, leaving you uncomfortable and with a bitter taste in your mouth. This is where low-acid coffee steps in to save the day.  
Low-acid coffee is a game-changer for those who experience digestive discomfort or want a smoother, gentler coffee experience. Here's why it's worth considering:  
**1. Reduced Gastrointestinal Distress**  
Low-acid coffee contains significantly less acid than regular coffee. The reduced acidity can help alleviate common digestive issues, making it a great choice for individuals with acid reflux, gastritis, or sensitive stomachs. By reducing the chances of stomach discomfort, it allows you to enjoy your morning ritual without worrying about unpleasant side effects.  
**2. Protecting Your Tooth Enamel**  
Acidic drinks, such as traditional coffee, can erode tooth enamel over time. Low-acid coffee is less damaging to your dental health. You can savor the rich flavors of coffee without the guilt of potentially harming your teeth.  
**3. A Smooth and Mild Flavor**  
Low-acid coffee is often praised for its smooth and mellow taste. It's not just about the reduced acidity; it's about the delightful flavor profile that can be appreciated by coffee connoisseurs. With its balanced and gentle taste, it offers a unique coffee experience.  
4. Better for Your Overall Health  
The health benefits of low-acid coffee go beyond just digestion and dental care. It is also rich in antioxidants, which can help protect your body against free radicals and oxidative stress. Antioxidants contribute to overall well-being and may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases.  
**5. Less Bitterness, More Enjoyment**  
Low-acid coffee tends to be less bitter than its high-acid counterparts. The bitterness in coffee can be an acquired taste, and many people prefer a smoother, more pleasant cup. Low-acid coffee satisfies that preference without compromising on the coffee's inherent charm.  
In conclusion, if you're looking for a coffee that is easy on your stomach, teeth, and taste buds, low-acid coffee is a fantastic choice. It offers a well-rounded coffee experience with a plethora of health benefits. So, go ahead and explore the world of low-acid coffee; your body and your taste buds will thank you.

Anyway, caffeine helps me to continue with my IF and - more importantly - reduce food craving (especially sweet food craving)...

So: how long do i neeed to wait to food leave my stomach? (Cause I want consume cafffeine on empty stomach)... I read that protein leaves stomach in slowest rate (fastest are Carbs) - true? ...

11iljza,healthyeating,Healthy Eating Protocol," 

* **I'm not a doctor, this list is purely educational and my own opinion, always consult medical professionals before trying the below eating lifestyle.**
* **Grocery List! (What and What Not to Buy!)**  

   * Note, Certified Organic food (look for the organic label) is always better in both taste and quality, but do the best you can with your budget and available stores
   * **Meat**  

      * **Approved**: (Note, the below meats are to be bought in their natural state, AKA a portion of uncooked meat that needs to be refrigerated or frozen, so that you know you are getting just meat when you eat.)
      * Chicken
      * Beef/Steak
      * Eggs
      * Fish
      * Turkey
      * Shrimp
      * Pork
      * Anything else that used to be a living animal
      * **Disapproved**
      * Deli meats, like sliced ham, sliced turkey, AKA the sandwich meats you put on your sandwich as a kid
      * Bacon, Bologna, Ham, pepperoni - These contain Pork (which is fine), but then add a bunch of other random fake food stuff or refined sugar and other chemicals.
      * Any meat that has some kind of chemical formula added on the ingredients, AKA polysorbate or something to “preserve freshness”. The ingredients should just be meat (and possibly salt if there is a second ingredient)
   * **Fats**  

      * **Approved**
      * Walnuts, Almonds, pecans, any kind of seed or nut (including cashew or peanut) - just read the ingredients to ensure that the only thing added to the nuts is salt, if anything.
      * Avocados
      * Olives
      * Olive Oil, Avocado oil, Macadamia Oil (attempt to get all of these in a glass container, or else the oil will spoil and get rancid)
      * Butter (only thing added is salt)
      * Cheese - read the label and ensure it is just milk, salt, and enzymes, and no random other stuff added like carrageenan.
      * **Disapproved**
      * Peanut, vegetable, canola oil. Essentially if it isn’t the above good oils, don’t get it.
      * Again, read all ingredients of all packages, since the above bad oils sneak into many products, especially nuts.
      * Nearly every dressing on earth has some of the above bad oils in it, read the label before you buy.
      * Margarine - this is basically made up of the above bad oils
   * **Vegetables and fruits**  

      * **Approved**
      * Could you go to a farm and find it in the state you are buying it? If so, then it is good. Prechopped veggies/fruits are fine as well.
      * Some easy ones for my wife and I are spinach, cucumber, celery, cherry tomatoes, onions, sweet potatoes, normal potatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, squash, cauliflower, broccoli.
      * For fruits, apples, oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, blueberries, bananas are all good.
      * Frozen Veggies are OK, if you read the ingredients and ensure that there are NO foreign chemicals added to preserve food.
      * **Disapproved**
      * Canned Veggies, veggies with random chemicals added.
      * Canned Fruits, dehydrated fruits (these should only be used as a “treat” since they are super sugary but without as many nutrients),
   * **Drinks**  

      * **Approved**
      * Water. Get a water filter for your tap or get a water filter jug. You’ll notice the difference in water taste. Purchase spring water from the store if you want bottled water, not purified water. Reverse Osmosis water is the best from what I've researched, consider it an investment into your health, and always drink from glass bottles, not plastic or metal, due to how metal and plastic ""leeches"" chemicals into the water.
      * Milk - Research for yourself (maybe on DuckDuckGo or something not as heavily censored as Google) the risks and rewards of raw, unpasteurized milk
      * Coffee - No added sugar allowed, only milk or cream (again, the cream must be milk based and not made up of hydrogenated oils). Use sparingly.
      * **Disapproved**
      * Soda, fruit juices (orange/apple) this will cause you to drink excess calories and sugar.
      * No diet sodas either, these have artificial sweeteners which are NOT food and cause harm to your body.
      * Alcohol - From a health perspective, alcohol is not needed (if you are tanking up on veggies and fruits), and it often has a ton of added sugar and random other stuff, and it actually negatively affects your sleep quality when taken too close to bedtime, even if it initially makes you feel relaxed. Use at your discretion.
   * **Complex Carbs**  

      * **Approved**
      * Any Kind of potato, rice (read packages if you are going to get the microwavable kinds), oatmeal, quinoa, other grains, and beans. The beans can be canned, just ensure that there is no added sugar or random chemicals to them, AKA baked beans or refried beans.
      * Sometimes bread, again read the label and see what is added to the bread. If it sweetened by honey or stevia, then its fine, but generally most bread has a lot of chemical additives and refined sugar added. Use sparingly.
      * **Disapproved**
      * White bread (including tortillas), most types of bread (due to above reasons), pasta (same reasons as bread).
   * **Sweeteners**  

      * **Approved**
      * Honey, Stevia, agave, fruit based sweeteners
      * **Disapproved**
      * Refined sugar (brown or white), Splenda, any “no calorie” sweetener like aspartame or sucralose or other “diet” sweeteners found in sodas.
      * Sugar is added to nearly EVERY packaged good and frozen good (from pizza to bread to ice cream), so read the labels of what you buy if you want to buy something prepackaged instead of the raw ingredients above.
   * **Seasonings**  

      * Salt (it can be iodized), but I prefer the grinder salt.
      * As for other seasonings, just ensure it doesn’t have “spices” in the ingredients since that is probably MSG. Pretty much any spices are fair game then, read the label and ensure it doesn’t have any man-made chemical in the name (polysorbate, glutamate, etc.), and you should be fine.
* **Healthy Eating Lifestyle Tips and Tricks**  

   * Eat meat with each meal, and throw in a veggie or a fruit as well. Meat increases feelings of fullness, as well as builds/preserves muscle mass. Try a fist full of meat and however many veggies or fruits you can fit on your plate. Veggies and fruits are God’s vitamins!
   * Meal prep lots of cooked meat, so you don't have to constantly be cooking throughout the week, I use Blue Diamond pans from Walmart to cook up large amounts of chicken thighs, ground beef, or fish, for the week.
   * Fruit is often demonized since it contains sugar, however, it is quickly absorbed into the body and doesn’t contribute to weight gain as much as complex carbs, see below for explanation.
   * Calories are either going to come from complex carbs (rice/potatoes/oatmeal/bread) or from fats (like nuts or seeds or avocado).
   * Fats are a good source of calorie, since they don’t spike blood sugar and therefore won’t lead to you holding onto excess body fat as easily. Try to eat fats at each meal or as a snack until you feel full. Try half a handful of seeds or nuts at first, to see how full you feel after.
   * Complex carbs are best saved either before exercise, or at the last meal of the day. Complex carbs raise blood sugar and serotonin levels (which makes you feel happy and relaxed), both of which are good to have before exercise, or to have before bed, so that you go to bed with a happy mind. Excess carbs throughout the day will lead to the body to only burn carbs as fuel, and excess bodyweight will start to occur, since the body won’t burn fat as fuel if it has carbs as an available source. Experiment with how **little** complex carbs you can eat before exercise or at the end of the day, to get the desired effect of a good workout or a happy sleep. More strenuous exercise is going to need more complex and simple carbs (oatmeal and honey, white rice and grapes, etc.) in order for your body to be primed to perform.
   * Try to eat mostly 3 – 4 meals a day, as opposed to constantly grazing. The body won’t burn bodyfat if it is constantly having a full or half full stomach, since the blood sugar is continually spiking. This is why intermittent fasting is so effective, or why your stomach sometimes growls when you wake up as well as you look leaner, since your body is ready for food and is burning fat. Space out your meals, and try to combine snacks into the next meal, to give your stomach time to empty and your blood sugar to stabilize.
   * Constantly drink water throughout day, add a pinch of salt here and there to ensure your body is actually absorbing water as opposed to it just flowing through you. You could attempt to drink ½ your bodyweight in ounces of water (i.e. a 200 lb man will drink 100 oz of water), but I find it more effective to just get a glass water bottle and drink from it every hour or so. Experiment and find an easy water-drinking-routine for yourself.
   * **If you're trying to lose weight:**  

      * Sleep is king in all things health, especially with losing weight, see my post on sleep here: [How to Get Good Sleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/11ijzho/my_sleep_protocol_wish_i_knew_how_to_sleep_earlier/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
      * Commit to a pain-free, sustainable, exercise routine, I recommend this: [https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/). Try it for at least a month.
      * Focus on eating quality, organic delicious meals that you'll actually eat, from the above list. Search for FB groups of healthy recipes. Throw out any disapproved foods from the house, to make it harder to cheat.
      * Start out with baby steps, like drinking water instead of soda, and cooking at home more.
      * Really challenge yourself to get most of your calories from fat, if not entirely for a few weeks. You will drop pounds quickly with this method, but will eventually get carb cravings. Add in carbs as prescribed above (before training, at dinner), in moderation.
* **Sample Eating Day** \*\*\* I am extremely boring when it comes to what I eat, feel free to experiment and get creative with your healthy diet!\*\*\*  

   * **Breakfast**  

      * Drink 16 oz of water, add a dash of salt to it.
      * 1.5 fists of organic ground turkey, Pace salsa on top
      * 4 stick of organic celery
      * ½ handful of almonds
   * **Lunch**  

      * 1.5 fists of organic ground turkey, Pace salsa on top
      * 4 stick of organic celery
      * ½ handful of almonds
   * **Dinner**  

      * Whatever wifey makes me 😊
   * **Preworkout**  

      * 1 – 1.5 cups of oatmeal, drizzle honey on it (this is if training is going to be strenuous, like all out sprints or heavy lifting)
   * **Postworkout**  

      * Honey (otherwise I will feel dizzy or weak or foggy after training)
   * **Dessert**

zgndsz,healthyeating,A review of drinking tea instead of soft drinks and a vanilla latte for a week to avoid HFCS," I always tried my best to eat healthy meals, but one day it suddenly occurred to me that I had never thought about HFCS. I was a person who couldn't live without a vanilla latte and coke...so first, I decided to drink healthy tea for a week. Because I knew that I couldn't stop drinking them all at once...

 HAHA I was looking for a healthy tea and saw a post recommending flower tea on this subreddit , so I tried it! Yeah, of course, I couldn't feel any dramatic changes, because it was just for a week, but it wasn't that bad to stop drinking vanilla latte and coke, and it was actually okay. So I'm thinking of drinking tea regularly instead of those soft drinks and coffee.

 This is a link to the tea I had[ ](https://kkokdam.com/)[https://kkokdam.com](https://kkokdam.com/)/ It's actually sugar-free, caffeine-free, and organic!

z5i5mi,healthyeating,I'm quite confused about what's considered Healthy nowadays,"I've been reading a lot about plant toxins, so now I'm questioning whether to eat vegetables or not. 

Beyond the (not so) common sense of avoiding processed foods, sugars etc. what are other common mistakes that people make with food? 

&#x200B;

I've been eating more grass fed meats (steaks, ground beef/turkey, turkey thighs), eggs, 

I pretty much shop only organic. 

I use Avocado Oil and Butter only. 

The only supplement I use is magnesium and beef liver. Not sure if I need a greens supplement. 

I very much minimize outside eating. 

I only have half a black coffee in the AM (2 hours after waking up), and another half around 130PM. I go to bed around 1130PM and wake up at 745AM. 

&#x200B;

But even though I exercise, sleep at least 7 hours, eat pretty damn clean compared to most people - I still feel lethargic at times. Especially after 3-4PM. 

&#x200B;

I do sit a lot in my job, but I get up very frequently. I've been trying to incorporate more physio as well. 

&#x200B;

Is there anything I can do better from this? I would love your help!",2022-11-26 21:14:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/z5i5mi/im_quite_confused_about_whats_considered_healthy/
xvmz68,healthyeating,"Coffee is healthier than tea, but both have benefits (Washington Post Article, No paywall)","*I'm a Well+Being editor at The Washington Post. We just published a guide to coffee vs tea. Which is better for you? There's a clear winner but both are good.* 

**A source of fiber**

Did you know that your morning coffee includes a dose of fiber? One [study](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17295507/__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!Dia3L-e5wBZJUZR5PrFVhROpZxzROXhojeE4z6oK8BgEunez4nPpPVHwLKsipIlayW0B1df2WzZGwQIHVkNHWQrqZf_dsCx8$?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) found that on average, coffee has between 1.1 and 1.8 grams of fiber per cup, depending on whether it’s filtered, espresso or instant.

That might not sound like much. But it’s more fiber than you’ll find in orange juice, which has about a half gram of fiber per cup. You’ll still need to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables to get the recommended 25 grams of daily fiber, but two or three cups of coffee a day can help you get there. A cup of tea on the other hand typically will not help you meet your daily fiber requirements — unless of course you decide to munch on the tea leaves. 

**Gut Microbiome** 

Coffee and tea are good sources of polyphenols — plant compounds that are thought to confer many health benefits. [Studies suggest](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6160559/__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!Dia3L-e5wBZJUZR5PrFVhROpZxzROXhojeE4z6oK8BgEunez4nPpPVHwLKsipIlayW0B1df2WzZGwQIHVkNHWQrqZZFSu1NX$?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) that polyphenols can lower your risk of developing chronic diseases, and they are “rocket fuel” for beneficial bacteria that make up your gut microbiome, the communities of trillions of microbes that live inside our guts, said Tim Spector, a professor at King’s College London. Coffee [has significantly more](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf802418j__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!Dia3L-e5wBZJUZR5PrFVhROpZxzROXhojeE4z6oK8BgEunez4nPpPVHwLKsipIlayW0B1df2WzZGwQIHVkNHWQrqZZYnr2yp$?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) polyphenols than green tea, and green tea has more polyphenols than black tea 

Spector and his colleagues can tell whether someone is a coffee drinker just by analyzing their poop. “There are specific microbes that seem to grow pretty well in people who drink a lot of coffee,” he said. They haven’t found a similar effect in tea drinkers.

uf5d3g,healthyeating,Healthy choices / discipline can be so hard.,"
Ok just having a moment but wanted to throw it out there. I’m on one of those glorious health kicks. I’m 31 -F - weighed 89kg at the start of this year 173cm tall. (Also Aussie) 

Active enough through work (tradie) but spent prior year giving zero fucks about my diet (lost my mum & I lost myself). Ate all the things, huge portions, snack city bitch and could easily put away half a carton of beer a day, everyday…. 

Realised I looked and felt like shit and decided rather than a fad diet and flogging myself at the gym I’d just start making better choices, not restrict too hard, but just slowly adjust to better habits. Anyways, I’m 10kg down and I haven’t stepped foot in a gym and haven’t starved or anything, just making healthy habits ya know?!? Like instead of having a sausage roll for breaky and an ice coffee I’ll have a piece of fruit or yogurt, shit like that. Instead of a bag of chips for a snack I’ll have tuna on crackers with tomato or cucumber etc. shit I like to eat mind you, I’m not having a stick of celery if you fucking paid me, fuck that…. 

BUT, the point of my rambling back story, is that I feel fucking good about myself, I’m proud, I have built really good habits and when I eat soul foods or drink booze, I don’t hate myself and “getting back on track” is easy/I just do it/get on with it the next day. It’s not a binge restrict cycle.

I’m at this point though where I want to lose the next 5kg of fat, start to create a bit of shape, and I know I’m going to have to implement more physical activity with workouts /weights and say NO more often to the soul foods/ alcohol… like a bit of blue cheese on some fancy fruit & nut cracker with some quince paste fuck me dead I’m drooling… Fuck you maggie beer. Lawd Christ almighty help me….

Today, I’ve done 11k steps just by walking into the market in town, I had a bowl of fresh strawberries and mango for breaky from the market, a black coffee, and a beloved fresh steamed pork bun. Lunch was salmon sashimi and Aburi scallop / salmon sushi… dinner reservation at the local Greek restaurant for 5:45pm and it’s currently 4:07pm. 

About 5 times guys, 5 fucking times this arv I have gotten out the blue cheese, I’ve weighed out the portion, I’ve weighed the crackers, I’ve scanned the quince paste into MFP…. Bro I AM BATTLING MYSELF. I want the food, but don’t want to spoil my exciting dinner, don’t want to take a backward step with my choices BUT THIS SHIT IS HARD! 

I know that if I’m not changing it, I’m choosing it. That’s my mantra with this whole lifestyle shift. Like yes, I can say yes to the cheese and crackers, I know it won’t kill me, but building these habits long term & saying no right now supports my current new goal and that is important to me, sigh BUT THAT DOESN’T MEAN IT ISN’T HARRDDDD :(

PLEASE TELL ME YOU FIT PEOPLE HAVE THIS MENTAL BATTLE…

I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I have a lot further to go. I love how good I feel about myself and how proud I am of coming this far, my confidence has really improved. But upping it now and taking that next step (doing specific workouts, being maybe more strict with calorie intake) it’s hard. 

I’m not on any plan, but I’m not under eating and I do include soul foods here and there so I don’t have a binge eating problem in this phase etc. it’s just that mental game right now. 

Mental game tips. Discipline tips. You guys struggle with this too??

- Almond milk, unsweetened vanilla
- Lots of hard boiled eggs
- blueberries
- bananas

- white bread
- fresh green juice using 1 apple, 1 lime, half a cucumber, 3 celery sticks, and a good amount of kale 3-4 times a week.

I've been trying to eat healthier lately and I've actually managed to lose about 20 pounds the last few months and I'm looking for areas to improve.  I generally go for an hour long walk/jog after work each day and try stay relatively active on weekends, but I know I could improve there.

My breakfasts and lunches during the week are 99% the same, and lunches on weekends usually consist of leftovers from dinner, but here's how it all breaks down:

Breakfast:
-16oz Hazelnut Coldbrew Coffee with a scoop of generic brand whey protein and a teaspoon of half and half
-A Kale Smoothie consisting of 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 2 Tbsp Flax Seed, 1 Medjool Date, several small slices of ginger root, 1/3 cup mixed berries (raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, and blueberry), and 1/2 cup of Kale greens, with water, obviously
-Either two small egg bites which are homemade (consisting of 1 Tbsp cheddar cheese and 1 Tbsp cottage cheese, along with one slice of bacon wrapped around the egg Bite) OR a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich on a White mini Bagel (consisting of mostly the same ingredients minus the cottage cheese

Lunch:
-2 cups pasta with homemade marinara sauce (sauce is made from a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, one medium white onion, and 1 cup of mixed Italian cheese blend)
-2 cups Kale Salad (about one cup of Kale with a pinch of sea salt and lemon juice to break down the greens, 1 Tbsp Sunflower seeds, 1 Tbsp dried cranberries, and 1/2 Tbsp Greek Salad Dressing)
-One Generic Brand Fruit Yogurt (usually strawberry or blueberry)
-One Cracker Barrell Cheddar Cheese Stick
-One Nature Valley Granola Bar (usually the chocolate peanut kind)
-One MacIntosh Apple OR two clementines
-4 homemade minimuffins 

Throughout the day, I refill a 24 oz water bottle that usually has a dash of lime juice in it for flavor, but is obviously just plain water when I refill it (generally 4 times a day).

Dinner varies, but usually is a meat with a side of veggies and some carbs.  Last night was half a skirt steak with a decent helping of roasted Roma tomatoes and pablano peppers and a scoop of grits, tonight was a quarter of a flank steak with roasted broccoli and fingerling potatoes.

I went to a coffee shop recently that makes and sells their own juice, and the juice I got from them was absolutely divine. The best part was that after I drank it, I felt ~amazing~. It had some strong notes of ginger and turmeric, and I know it had blueberries, but I’m not sure what other fruit it had.

So it got me wondering—does anyone out there have a go-to juice recipe that does the trick for them when they don’t feel well?

B. If you walked into a room with just apples on the counter, microwave meal and a healthy prepared meal in the fridge

Your decisions have been heavily influenced by the design of the room - what you would choose to do in scenario A and B are likely to be different. If you think about the design of your room beforehand you can encourage certain behaviours. There is a lot of research to show that humans tend to do whatever is the easiest thing... that's why supermarkets tap into this - The most profitable items are in the middle of the shelf where you can easily reach, the less profitable items are right at the bottom.

2. If you want to discourage a bad behaviour make it as difficult as possible

e.g. The frying pan is kept upstairs somewhere!

I have applied some design decisions to my environment below to encourage or discourage my exercise and eating habits... please feel free to add more in the comments and ill chuck them in!

1. Only have healthy food on display (fruits, nuts, Carrots...! )
2. Remove all unhealthy food from your house - I need to walk a mile to get a coke!
3. Place your unhealthy cooking equipment in a bag upstairs (frying pan, Pizza Cutter)
4. I have my gym clothes laid out ready to go on a chair before i go to bed
5. I have my coffee machine turn on at 7AM every day
6. I prepare healthy full meals and healthy snacks in advance for impulse eating
7. I have a pint of water next to my bed when i go to sleep and I need to finish it when i wake up",2020-06-23 23:03:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/hep83l/all_our_decisions_are_influenced_by_your/

dnvdoe,healthyeating,Day 8 of Quitting Sugar,"I still am craving. Every time I drink coffee my heart longs for its' absent sugar. However many sweeteners I put in, it just isn't the same. The worst cup of coffee is the morning one. I clearly have an emotional attachment to being woken up and  it makes zero difference that I am now arising from my deathly slumber as fresh as the prince of Bel-Air. Part of me cannot help but think that I would be even more zingy if I had sugar, even though logically I know that blood sugar fluctuations is what caused the problem in the first place. But if I say yes to sugar in just the morning, I will be keeping the door just the tiniest bit propped open to future re-addiction. If it's never an option, no matter what the circumstances,I will be less likely to start consuming it on a regular basis again.

But saying that I must admit to having a late afternoon can of coke yesterday, it was so intensely sweet I could barely drink it. It's a shame really because I was so good at lunch and just had some water. I was truly exhausted after an entire day walking around the mall with three kids after just 4 hours sleep. Tiredness is definitely my danger zone.

I have already lost 5 pounds in weight, I cannot find my tape measure to check if I've lost any inches. Ideally I want to lose 12 more pounds and a couple more inches, then I'll be happy with my weight.

aqfdwz,Wellness,Sleep Hygiene 101,"Sleep can have a major impact on one’s health and ability to function day to day, yet many people do not get enough. How often at work or school do you hear people complaining about not getting enough sleep or even worse, bragging about how little they got? The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0215-enough-sleep.html) has previously reported that 1 in every 3 American’s do not get enough sleep and other sources claim even higher statistics. So, what you do need to do if you want to fix your sleep situation?
     
     
**Sleep Routine**
     
If you have to get up for work at 5 am during the weekdays, you should not spend every weekend staying up all night and sleeping in past noon. That is not to say you can’t have late nights and/or sleep in, especially if you are feeling run down and can use the extra sleep, but you should not be doing it every weekend. Once you get yourself use to a set routine, you will have an easier time going to bed at night and feel more refreshed and awake in the morning.

**Caffeine**

   
The effects of caffeine can often be felt for 6+ hours depending on your sensitivity and amount drank. The [Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine](http://jcsm.aasm.org/viewabstract.aspx?pid=29198) reported a study that drinking coffee within 6 hours of going to sleep can have negative effects on your overall sleep. If you struggle to fall asleep at night and are a fan of caffeine, cut back on the total amount of caffeine you drink as well as how late in the day you drink it. Try to avoid having caffeine after noon and if you have to, aim for items on the lower end of the caffeine scale (tea for example). Everyone is different and genetics can play a big role in caffeine sensitivity, so play around with when you drink caffeine to see how it is affecting your sleep.

**Avoid the bed**
      
The bed should only serve two purposes, sleep and sex. Avoid laying down in the bed for anything else as it can sometimes cause the body to disassociated bed time with being awake doing something else. Do not lay down in bed to watch T.V or read. Go sit elsewhere and get away from the bed.

**Avoid Smoking/Alcohol**
       
Even though drinking may make you fall asleep (or pass out), it suppresses REM sleep which is vital for a truly restorative nights sleep. Many have experienced still feeling tired or groggy after a heavy drinking despite a full nights sleep. Smoking also may have a negative effect on REM sleep, but it also serves as a stimulant thus making it more difficult to fall asleep at night.



**Physical activity/inactivity**

For some people, exercising right before bed leaves them amped up and they struggle to fall asleep. For others, it does not matter. This can also be amplified by the use of pre-workout caffeine supplements. The key here is experiment and see how your body is affected. If you find working out stimulates you, do your workout earlier or get up earlier and work out in the morning. On the other side of the coin, a lack of physical activity can cause sleep issues (along with numerous other negative health consequences).


**Hunger**

For some people, going to bed hungry can make it extremely difficult to fall asleep. For others, a full meal that leaves them bloated makes them struggle to sleep. The key here is to know yourself and set up a system that works for you. If you know you get hungry at night, have later meals and/or plan to have a snack before bed. If you struggle with sleep due to feeling full, avoid late night food or figure out what foods trigger that feeling. Now, this advice is not saying make it a free for all with your food choices. If you are trying to control your weight/diet, pick things that fit in within your diet/calories. An apple before bed may be all you need.",2019-02-14 03:31:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellness/comments/aqfdwz/sleep_hygiene_101/
1msz6iq,keto,High fiber middle eastern coffee,"Dear Keto community,

I’ve been back on keto for 28 days now after a long break. The main reason I decided to restart was to tackle my chocolate addiction, and so far it’s been going well.

I’ve only had chocolate once, and even then it was keto-friendly. I made a chocolate mousse with liquid sucralose (0 g sugar), eggs, and butter, and it turned out perfect. It didn’t knock me out of ketosis.

However, I’m an avid coffee drinker, and the coffee I used to indulge in is from the Middle East. It’s prepared the same way as Turkish coffee, but it’s not Turkish coffee. According to the nutritional information, the whole 400 g package contains 86.5 g of carbs, of which 16.5 g are sugars. A 400 g pack usually lasts me about a month if I drink it three times a week.

My question is: although the sugar content per serving is quite low, could the high fiber content be a risk for getting kicked out of ketosis? I admit I’m quite ignorant when it comes to fiber. Mind you that most of the beans used in making this coffee isn’t being digested.

Thanks in advance 🙏🙏",2025-08-17 18:52:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1msz6iq/high_fiber_middle_eastern_coffee/

I want to start keto diet because of pre-diabetes. Don’t need to lose weight except for a “diabetes belly”.
Already lift and would like a little bit of gaining lean muscle.
I have made a meal plan for a daily guideline. I wonder is this is okay for a 1,93 male, average weight, sedentary job, but walk 10k a day and lift weights 3 times a week.

Morning
Bulletproof coffee (25 grams of grass fed butter and 15ml MTC oil)

Lunch
Salad with 4 eggs, 2 tablespoons Evoo, 200 gram of chicken thighs, 30 gram of walnuts, half an avocado

Dinner
250 grams of grass fed beef with some vegetables with a tablespoon of Evoo. 
200 gram of full fat Greek yogurt with some blueberries.

On days when i lift half a banana pré and after workout or some sweet potato.

Is this okay or too little to prevent weight loss/muscle loss. What can I add/change?

1msqp53,keto,Hola!,"So new to this group not new to keto, I’ve been doing keto off and on mostly on for the last two years. When I started keto, I weighed 316 pounds and I got really into it, I weigh all of my food to the gram kind of gamify it.  I went from 316 to 190, when I started, I couldn’t eat eggs without toast or some kind of bread, It was just one of those things and when I had coffee, I would drink it with a pint of cream and 16 tablespoons of sugar and that’s only slightly exaggerating, my coffee tasted like hot coffee ice cream.  

Eventually, I got to the point where now all I drink is black coffee and I know put cream in it. It’s good. It’s extra fat, but I’ve kind of learned to enjoy just black coffee took me about three months to really get into it. Of course, then I started adding butter to it and a little bit of coconut oil , but that’s basically like putting cream in it so it works for me.  

After I got down to 190 I thought I’ve got this. I don’t need to do keto anymore and I put about 45 pounds because I just can’t be fucking trusted with carbs lol.  I’ve been back on keto for about four weeks kicking butt have my favorite snack snacks, which are Lindt chocolate bars and for a treat I’ll have one square of a lit dark chocolate bar and that’s plenty and I’ll eat like one or 2 ounces of fruit today just for something sweet that’s you know a good cleanser for my pallet  

Someday, maybe I’ll post before and after pictures, but I don’t have that many pictures of me when I was the size of a blue whale for obvious reasons I did not enjoy pictures, the reason I got on keto was I saw a picture of a friend who passed away from her disease and an event, and I looked at the picture and a man. He was just huge and he was hugging someone you couldn’t see the person‘s face and I asked somebody who’s angel with and they’re like dude that’s you, I was literally just as big as he was and that’s the day that I went on keto. After laughing at my friends were doing it and being like don’t be stupid and blah blah blah I called up one of my friends we were talking and I started getting some keto pointers and I went cold turkey on carbs and even now you know between five and 10 carbs a day is really where I’m at.  Anyway, sorry for the long post, but I’m new here. Thought I’d give some background some experience and here I am.   ",2025-08-17 13:17:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1msqp53/hola/

Today coffee was needed. I had a look online and found that you can mix your almond milk with double cream, and use that in the machine. 

For a cappuccino the ratio was listed as below. You may need more of less of each for larger drinks, but stick to the ratio of 1 part cream to 3-4 parts almond milk:

30 ml double cream

120 ml unsweetened almond milk (½ cup)

It was lovely. I could taste the cream, have a richness to it, but the almond milk appeared to just give the coffee taste a nutty edge, quite nice actually.

1moquc7,keto,Down 30 pounds in 2 months here’s what works for me,"Yesterday I made a post about going from 220 to 187 in the span of just over two months. I was getting lots of love, but also got some questions of what I’m doing to shed the weight. So I figured I’d make another post about what’s working for me to answer some questions.

First and foremost I am NOT a dietician, nutritionist, medical advisor, or doctor of any kind! This is simply my firsthand experience of how I’m losing some weight with a ketogenic lifestyle. 

Let’s go to the beginning. Keto flu is a VERY common term that I’m sure most of us have heard doing a quick search into this lifestyle change. Basically this is your body withdrawing from sugar and carbs. I won’t lie, the first couple weeks up to a month SUCKS, but look at it more with a curious mindset of “sugar and carbs can’t be good for me if it makes me feel this bad going without.” 

So what’s the cure for this “flu”? For me the best way to curb the symptoms was to gradually lower my carb intake instead of jumping straight in to less than 20 grams per day. When I started tracking, I limited them to 50 grams for the first three days, then down to 40 grams, and slowly down to 20 through the next week. The next thing I did was forced myself to drink about a gallon of water each day. I also use a keto friendly electrolyte drink mix I got from Amazon, and I find it helps with the leg cramps I experience at bed time. 

In the first week I didn’t count calories, but I did watch my carbs and sugar. Like I said I’m not a medical professional here, but I feel like eating more calories filled with lots of fat and protein also helps the keto flu symptoms. 

You’re going to feel tired, lethargic, sick, and worn down in the first couple weeks, but IT DOES GET BETTER. One morning you’ll wake up and after your coffee you won’t be waddling to the bathroom for a number 2 break, you’ll find yourself clear headed, and you actually have energy. Congratulations you’re now fat adapted and more than likely in ketosis! Look at yourself as a lean mean fat burning machine!

So what do I eat? I am probably the most boring person to ask. I find keeping things simple works best for me. I also have autism and my biggest thing is I like things to stay the same and love my routines, so I will happily eat the same thing every single day and never get sick of it. 

So here’s my main meals I make:

Quick side note - I don’t have a social life at all, so I simply don’t go out to eat and this means there’s zero temptation or pressure to cheat. This isn’t realistic for most folks, but again this is what I’m doing.  

Breakfast - I usually skip it honestly and just go with a coffee with keto friendly creamer in it. Sometimes I get really wild and add in MCT oil for a little boost of energy. HIGHLY recommend MCT oil if you want to add some quick calories. 

Lunch - spinach salad with a little ranch dressing, two hard boiled eggs, and two cheese sticks. This is every single day that I work. Like I said pretty boring right?😂

Dinner - keeping it simple again with a meat; burger, chicken thigh, pork, or for special occasions a ribeye steak. Along with the meat I usually steam broccoli or I’ll have a small spinach salad with it. I find somedays I feel weak so I’ll add in more calories with a couple fried eggs and maybe some cheese too. 

Snacks - I don’t snack much, but I do keep hard boiled eggs on hand for something quick. I also keep a bag or two of Macs Golden Cracklins for a good crunchy snack when I get the random craving for a late evening munchy. 

Now the fast track cheat code to a ketogenic weight loss strategy….intermittent fasting! I work two jobs, so I base my eating schedule around them. If I only work my main full time job, I’ll either do one big meal for the day or two smaller meals. On days I work both my jobs, I’ll have two meals and I’ll usually snack on some of those pork rinds when I get home since I worked off a lot of calories throughout the day. When I’m off both jobs I’ll usually plan a 48 hour fast, but I listen to my body; if my stomach is growling and I’m tired then I’ll eat, but if I’m not hungry I won’t eat just for the sake of eating. 

I think that’s the most important thing I’ve learned from doing keto this time around, I’m using food more like a fuel. You don’t fill up on gas in the car when you only drove 5 miles since the last fill up right? Maybe that’s a bad comparison, but you get what I’m saying here. 

Another important thing I’ve learned is don’t starve yourself. Don’t push yourself. This is a marathon not a sprint! If you’re hungry then eat. If you’re not hungry then do one meal a day. Simple as that. I find I don’t lose weight if I overeat and I find I don’t lose weight if I under eat too. There’s a balance to find, and the easiest way for me to find my groove is to listen to what my body is telling me it needs. 

Last tip. Drink water and drink LOTS of it. Get yourself a nice big 64 oz water bottle that keeps stuff cold and carry it with you everywhere. This will help with hunger cravings in the early stages of getting into keto as well. Like I said I use two servings of some electrolyte drink mix everyday as I find it helps with the leg cramps I experience, and somedays I’ll add a third or fourth serving if it was extra hot at work and I sweat a lot. 

As far as my calorie deficit goes or my macros, I don’t count really. I know that’s horrible advice, but I go crazy when I keep track of all the numbers and everything. I’d say my calories are around 1200 - 1700 a day depending on work schedule. Is this healthy? I have no idea, but as long as I have energy and I’m losing weight then I figure it’s probably ok. 

I know I missed about a hundred things, but this is the gist of what’s working for me. Feel free to ask any questions if you need me to elaborate on anything.

1mj05jj,keto,I don't look 'great' so far - no face gains really,"Hi fellow Keto-ers. 

So far, I've lost a decent amount of weight in the first three weeks or so, just over 10 pounds. 

But face-wise, I look a bit tired and puffy if I'm honest. 

My sleep hasn't been great and I do suffer from apnea which I'm trying to reverse through weight loss. I have a lot of issues around sleep actually - staring at screens, late bedtimes - so I do believe sleep is something I really need to work on and that is probably a key factor. 

I guess I have stored all my fat in my belly so already had a relatively slim face but I just look more tired and haggard then before. 

To that end I was actually thinking of cutting coffee for a while and just drinking green tea. I wonder if anyone has tried that?

it seems coffee is held in very high regard in this forum but just wondering whether others have felt better cutting it out. According to Dr Berg, stress creates excess melanin which makes bags worse - so I was thinking that perhaps by going down the green tea route that I can start to reduce stress and cortisol release on a daily basis. 

I'm trying to get better with electrolyte supplementation. My diet has been on point otherwise. 

But yeah - overall I feel motivated but I'm a little dismayed about my face so far. 

I should also note I have decided to cut alcohol, so obviously I guess these positive changes will take some time to filter through?

How long was it for you when you started looking better? Do I need to just stick it out?",2025-08-06 09:36:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mj05jj/i_dont_look_great_so_far_no_face_gains_really/

1mb0i4j,keto,Lost 13 POUNDS,"I lost 13 pounds in 2 weeks and 4 days. 
 
When I started Keto I kinda discovered it by accident , but the idea of my body burning my fat as a fuel source had me thinking. 

I decided to give it a REAL shot and it’s been hard I won’t lie , I was a pretty avid beer drinker almost every weekend I had to of taken down about 8 beers minimum (Coors Banquet) not very good for you. Since then I’ve been eating much cleaner as well. I’ve been using Tuna creations packets to make tuna salads with avocado mayo , olive oils , guaq, lime & random cheeses as well. They’re not bad at all & I make sure to eat them with celery for that crunch feeling that’s so satisfying and delicious . When I got out i mainly get salads making sure that there’s no hidden carbs in the salad. I also sometimes get a rotisserie chicken from Publix or Walmart and eat that as my protein for about 3 days. Pairing it with cheese and random condiments like peanuts .. and celery ! God I love celery. I don’t exactly count my macros , but I do make sure I eat under 20gs of carbs a day and just get protein and a good amount of fats in. 

I started at 187.5lbs about 3 weeks ago , my first go didn’t go to well because I ate a crap ton of watermelon and completely ruined my ketosis. I now am much more careful and decisive with what I consume. 

Fast forward 2 weeks! 

Today I weighed my self at the gym with a digital scale and I was 175lbs!!! I mean I couldn’t even believe it my self. It was actually funny because yesterday I weighed my self at Publix and I thought the scale was off  because just last week I was about 10 pounds heavier! (I’ll add the video if I can) I’m hitting the gym hard trying to maintain my muscle while burning off this fat! Mainly hitting heavy workouts to really tell my muscle to stay alive and that I need it lol. I also run about 2 miles everyday minimum some days more depends how I feel . Just trying to stay active and condition for soccer. 

I’ve been waking up better every morning feeling great not tired at all , not lazy , occasionally I go for the second snooze alarm but rarely now. I have been more motivated to get good sleep as well (no more late night game sheses with the boys) .. but that’s okay. I have more energy durning the day I don’t need coffee at all anymore which used to be a morning routine. I am much more social I have less social anxiety , I guess I just feel happier with my self so it makes me want to share that energy?

Now on other hand , I truly haven’t felt anything bad towards the diet except the fact that I can’t eat enjoy “the good foods” like the pizza when hanging with friends or the good menu items.. but I’m quickly getting over that. Now the alcohol ? I rarely drink now just due to the fact that I don’t really need to? Yesterday I went out and I totally did not want to be sober all night so I did have a double tequila coke and that’s all for the whole night .. I pat my self in the back for that 🙂‍↕️(before I would drink like a fish) glad to be changing my life it’s very exiting. 
I have been getting more musky which I never do and that’s the first thing that believe it or not got me super excited since that’s a ketosis symptom.  

I will add some photos from sort of where I was at when I started vs now. 

Everyone please stay motivated this diet works and I’m excited to continue doing it. 

Currently I weight 175lbs

1may723,keto,Advice: On Keto for Metabolic Phsychiatric Therapy but...,"... my glucose just won't go down (generally between 5.75 and 7.25)  and  only reached low ketosis a few times- whyyyyyyy?

Currently:

- IF 20:4 w/ eating window 15:30 - 19:30 pm.
- 1 meal a day plus snack.
- No processed foods other than dairy, yogurt, hot sauce, tofu, almond milk (unsweetened), and the occasional sugar free drink or instant coffee. 
- KetoMojo test daily at the end of my fast. 
- Logging daily in CarbManager 
- Macros C: 5% P: 25% F: 70%
- Started with 25g Net C but switched to 25g Total C and just reduce to a little under 20g in desperation.
- Weighing foods.
- Breaking fast with MCT oil, topping up fats at end of window with olive or mct oil.
- Ghee and olive oil in everything.
- Black coffee in the am.
- Green tea or water during fast, though admit drinking/hydrating is a struggle for me.

Additional factors:
- Female, 50 , no kids
- Have 2 clinically diagnosed autoimmune conditions.
- Mobily barriers for the past few years.
- Cancer and full hysterectomy last year > HRT (All clear now!)
- Recieving Metabolic Phsychiactric Therapy hoping to reduced medication spectrum/reliance and reduce inflammation/pain.
- Working on gaining back mobility/ strength  though slower after 4 years with long periods of immobility due to illness.
-Previously active, strong, playful, and extremely mobile.


RE KetoMojo: 
Through reading other posts, I see many comments that are not in support of glucose and ketone tracking. 

Kindly remember, there is a difference  between following the general keto diet and keto that results in extended periods high ketosis.

In addition, data collection, G&K tracking, weighing foods, and a keto diet in its' strictest form are required while receiving treatment in a Metobolic Psychiatry Program.


Lastly,....

IF YOU DONT HAVE KIND OR CONSTUCTIVE ADVICE PLEASE JUST SCROLL ON BY.... 

...otherwise, thank-you for your time and attention.

1maootl,keto,Keto update,"I started at the beginning of August. I am m 46 5’11 and weighed 215. My whole life I could eat whatever I wanted and never gain weight. I always worked out a lot and it was no different recently. The difference was no matter how much I ate I was never satisfied. 

Two months later I am down 20lbs. But there are some other interesting benefits. My mood is def more stable. Today I just benched 265, only 10 lbs less than my all time max. 4 weeks in my strength was much lower. Shows fat adaptation is real. Also shows you can lose weight without losing muscle. 

But the most surprising benefit is how I react to caffeine. Before keto I had massively cut back caffeine and only had it a couple times a week when I have to wake up early for work. I cut it out because it gave me anxiety/jitters and then a hard crash. Since being on keto I don’t get anxiety nor do I crash. I love coffee and missed it a lot. I also gave up booze 6 years ago so it’s so nice to have at least on vice!

I plan to stay on this for at least 6 months as I want to reverse the insulin tolerance I think I got. At that point I will likely stay in a modified version. 

What’s so weird is even though I never get to eat the things I truly love - I don’t feel any less happy or joyful in my life. ",2025-07-27 15:10:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1maootl/keto_update/

Now this is my second attempt but I'm doing some things different this time. 

So this time I'm drinking at least 80oz of water per day along with two scoops of fiber. I only eat twice a day and have a 10hr windows. I'm not doing as much processed foods this time but I am using shredded cheese, cream cheese, and salad dressing. Besides that there's nothing else processed. Today i had 4 eggs and 6oz of ground turkey for breakfast. Along with coffee, 2 tablespoons of half an half. Then for dinner one piece of salmon and a spring mix salad with purple onions, shredded cheese, salad dressing, and banana peppers. Then for snack i had 1 tablespoon of peanut butter.

1m3ss98,keto,Can someone tell me the truth about keto and your heart health? I’m just very confused.,"Like real talk. My family doesn’t have history of heart issues however my mom’s side has diabetes and high blood pressure. However many blood pressure generally has always been fine. The people who have high blood pressure in my family are obese and I’m not obese.

I’ve been doing keto the past couple weeks. My diet consists of lots of eggs (4-8 eggs a day) half and half for my coffee, a bit of heavy cream, turkey pepperoni for a snack, spinach with olive oil and vinegar and lemon juice and salt (salad) lots of cheese, chicken, sometimes lite Caesar dressing. I have 3-4 cups of coffee a day. I suck at drinking water but I try. I brew my coffee so it isn’t like espresso shots so the water in that itself makes me use the bathroom a lot. I also take adhd medication idk if that matters. Every time I’ve gone to the doctors at least before I started taking my medication I’ve always been healthy except I used to be a bit overweight. 

I’ve just been reading and thinking . I CONSTANTLY worry and have health anxiety. I saw that too much saturated fat isn’t good for you even with keto. Now I’m just confused. I really wanna continue especially because my skin has been breaking out and I’m less active than I used to. I workout out. I do high intense moderate cardio for 60-80 min a week (I do incline walking 8-9% at 2.5-3mph)and lift to hit all my muscle groups. I need to focus on drinking more water .

I sound very ignorant but it’s genuinely so confusing to know what’s good and not good. First red meat is bad then sugar is bad then carbs are bad then butter is bad then eggs are bad from the cholesterol then dairy is bad it’s all a confusing I just wanna be healthy. Do i really need to watch out for my saturated fats? I know I eat healthier because I eat more spinach and wayyy more protein than before. Also I don’t wanna get ahead of my self but I THINK my skin is clearing up but I’m not sure. It’s been breaking out for a whole year it wouldn’t clear up on my cheeks. Probably the combo of carbs, little protein and less cardio.

Someone please explain this to me!!!! I am 24 years old and female. I’m 5’8 157lbs and have a toned body but gained fat and lost muscle due to lack of protein the past year   and I just wanna be healthy, not be bloated, gain back my muscle, feel good, look good and have clear skin. Again sorry for the ignorance if I sound stupid

Edit: I wanna understand if I stayed my weight band did keto vs no keto, wouldn’t keto be worse for my heart? Yes I know eating unhealthy keto at a lower weight is healthier than eating less fat but obese. But my question is in general like is having this much saturated fats bad? Or does not having carbs “cancel” it out?",2025-07-19 10:17:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1m3ss98/can_someone_tell_me_the_truth_about_keto_and_your/
1m36hih,keto,Keto's Secret Energy Hack?⚡,"Alright, keto fam, I seriously need to talk about something mind-blowing that's happening to me! I don't even know if this is normal, but my energy has become incredibly stable and awesome, like I've found some secret fuel for my body, and it's all without coffee or crashes throughout the day! I'm genuinely shocked.

My whole life, I used to live on coffee. I'd wake up in the morning needing a cup just to open my eyes, and midday, I'd need another one so I wouldn't crash from exhaustion. After lunch? Forget about it, I'd fall into a food coma and just want to sleep anywhere. I always told myself, ""This is just normal, everyone gets tired like this."" I was just pushing myself through life.

When I started keto, of course, my main goal was weight loss and improving my health. But what I didn't expect was the transformation in my energy. Gradually, I started waking up feeling energised in the morning, without needing coffee right away. All day long, there are no ""sugar crashes"" or sudden feelings of exhaustion after eating. My energy is continuous and strangely stable, like I'm running on a battery that never runs out.

It's such a weird and liberating feeling at the same time. It's like my body was always operating at half power, and now it's discovered its full strength.

Has keto done this for everyone's energy? Has anyone else felt like they discovered a 'secret fuel' like this? And what's the most surprising thing about this change for you?",2025-07-18 16:11:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1m36hih/ketos_secret_energy_hack/

60s F, I’ve been on Keto about a month. I had a couple cheat days last week because we were away. 

I eat a couple eggs with butter and cheese slices every morning. I have meat for lunch and dinner. I have full fat yogurt and/or sour cream for snacks. I have well under 20 grams of low carb vegetables per day (one cup broccoli -  6 grams carbs…). I have a T butter as a snack a couple times per day. 

I honestly felt great the first couple weeks. This is especially true after loosely following the vegan diet for years. I’m concerned about the racing heart and the insomnia. 

I read your guidelines about electrolytes. Please advise. I’m taking 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, 105mg potassium chloride capsules, 1000 mg magnesium malate tablets. I bought them on Amazon. Is that not enough potassium?  Too much of anything else?  I drink a minimum of 16oz of water when I take these. I drink water (coffee in the morning) throughout the day.

1lyiep8,keto,To anyone just starting and not seeing the scale move: keep going,"28F | Starting Weight: 155 lbs, CW: 140lbs

I started keto on May 27 (because honestly, why wait for the 1st?). At first, the scale barely moved; maybe a couple pounds here and there. By the end of June, I was starting to feel super discouraged. But I kept going, even with my husband and friends eating cake, bread, and all the summer goodies around me.

My mindset was basically: this is the last time I’m doing this so I should give it my 100% before deciding this lifestyle is not for me. I’ve tried keto a bunch of times before but always gave in to cravings or keto flu within a few weeks.

But then this week (July 7), the scale suddenly dropped. I saw 145 lbs… and then 140 today! My friend that I haven’t seen in a couple of months:

“Did you lose weight? You look AMAZING.” 

Sometimes your body’s working behind the scenes, even if the scale isn’t moving right away. It’s not linear, the weight loss gurus were right. Keep going!

(And no, my scale isn’t broken—I tested it with my 5 lb dumbbells just to be sure 😂; also try ditching those keto tortillas to experiment if they’re stalling you; they stalled me.)

EDIT:

For anyone starting out—here are some tips I’ve learned (the hard way) over the years, mostly by punishing my body and it fighting back:

1. Make it easier for yourself.
I said easier, not easy. For example: before keto, I’d start my mornings with avocado toast or yogurt with honey and granola with a latte. Going keto meant sitting there watching my husband eat all of that 😂. If I forced myself to eat eggs (which I hate) while watching him enjoy my favorite foods, I’d give up; and I have, in the past.

So this time, I found an alternative that actually works for me: chia seed pudding with berries and a protein shake with some instant coffee in it (thank you Fairlife for saving my sanity). That way, I don’t have to hate him for enjoying his life or hate my own body. I can just sit and enjoy my breakfast.

2. Make social stuff easy (on you and your friends)
I go out a lot like picnics, dinners, potlucks. If I know a friend made something that’s keto-friendly, I’ll bring my own tortillas and eat it with their curry or salad or chicken skewers. If not, I’ll show up with my own food (let’s say I’d pick up tuna salad and celery sticks from Whole Foods). The key: don’t wing it.

Don’t go thinking, “I’ll just have coffee,” or “I’ll eat before/after.” That just makes it so much harder than it needs to be. Ultimately, if your friends are decent, they’ll eventually start including at least one thing you can eat too :)

3. Minimize your losses when eating at a restaurant:
I usually order a salad with grilled chicken or salmon. I don’t stress about the dressing. I mean, I’m already showing up for myself by skipping the pizzas and pastas my friends are eating. I let my body enjoy those two tablespoon of Caesar dressing :)

4. I didn’t really focus on fat. I focused on protein-that’s just what worked for me.
I realized protein made me feel full and kind of “meh” about carbs. Like, if there’s chicken and fries on the table, I’ll eat the chicken and salad first, as much as I can. Once I’m full, I might try one french fry or take one bite of pasta but by then, I’m so full that I don’t even want more. I’d call it a day by either having some sparkling water or protein shake if there wasn’t enough protein in my meal. 

5. The ability to not being an asshole to myself. Yesterday, I went to a blueberry farm where you could eat blueberries while picking them. Istg I ate 40 blueberries while filling my bucket (I’d already hit my net carb before I went). Did I get out of ketosis? Maybe. Idk. But I’m not going to hate or feel bad about myself for eating blueberries, man. Beating myself up over some extra fruits? I’m not doing that anymore.",2025-07-13 03:02:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lyiep8/to_anyone_just_starting_and_not_seeing_the_scale/
1lw1ae7,keto,"Missing ice cream, sorbet, or milkshakes in the heat?? I have you covered!","Just because we are on keto doesn't mean we have to miss out on cold  sweet summer treats!

You need any of these to prepare: 

1. Get the Ninja Creme if it is your budget for the best consistency. Cheapest at Costco. 
 [Ninja Creme] (https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/ninja-creami-7-in-1-ice-cream-maker-0430776p.html?utm_content=shopping&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21210993524&gbraid=0AAAAADojZphonPVMU1UY7r_JI3rHaYNsS&gclid=CjwKCAjwyb3DBhBlEiwAqZLe5Pr2zHWQ98fu8Wor3ZFIJ6ahu2OxB0588hr20UhZhPrZvLU9VM1cnRoC4-8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds#store=248)

2. Use a bullet or a blender with very little liquid (water/coconut water/ whipping cream/ half and half/plant based milk) so the frozen mixture blends thick. 

3. Freeze in popsicle moulds and serve.


NOTE: All ingredients should be combined and frozen ahead of time. Also if you need to meet your fat intake quota, add mct oil when blending to serve. 


Tastey keto flavours:

1. Coffee, whipping cream, monkfruit sugar. 

Option: 
Grated high quality dark chocolate for popsicle molds or stirred in just before serving.

2. Avocado, monkfruit sugar (Many parts of the world eat avo sweetened in shakes and desserts. This combo with a little ice, cream/almond milk, and a mct oil makes a killer milkshake in a regular blender.)

3. Make an easy stovetop recipe for egg custard. (Cream/eggs/monkfruit sugar, vanilla).
Eg. [https://thebigmansworld.com/keto-custard/](https://thebigmansworld.com/keto-custard/)

Option: 
Add grated high quality dark chocolate  or minced berries to the mixture above  for  popsicle moulds or stir in just before serving for milkshake or soft serve.

4. Frozen berries ( or any keto friendly fruit) , a TBSP of lemon, monkfruit sugar and a dash of salt = sorbet

Options: 
A. Add cottage cheese or cream cheese with the berries for a cheesecake flavour or added protien.
B. Mix berries 50/50 with whipped cream or yogurt or kefir or canned coconut milk
C. Alternated layers of the berry and cream base mixtures in popsicle moulds or blend separately once frozen and serve in layers. 

5. Freeze cucumber or celery, lemon or lime juice, mint, coconut water, monk fruit sugar 

6. Mix whipped cream or canned coconut milk or cream cheese (or any combo of) and a package of sugar free jello = ambrosia flavour 

Option: 
Add finely chopped berries after mixing the above ingredients for popsicle molds or stir in just before for milkshakes or soft serve.

7. Blend whipped cream, peanut butter powder, and monkfruit sugar then  freeze. Then make the berry sorbet above.  Freeze layered in moulds or blend separately once frozen and  serve layered for pbj.

8. Canned coconut milk flavour with chai spice or cinnamon or cardamon or pie spices, monk fruit sugar, pinch of salt.

9. Make a strong batch of chai. Mix with  whipping cream or canned coconut milk or plant based milk and monk fruit sugar. ( I am a fan of combining whipping cream and unsweetened vanilla almond milk.)


10. BONUS OPTION if you are feeling really ambitious: ""Ice cream cake/bars"":

Mix powdered chopped almonds or almond flour with ghee/butter/mct oil (alone or a mix of), monkfruit sugar and a punch or salt. Press into the base of a bake and freezer friendly tin/ or pyrex. Bake  your ""shortbreadcrust/ cheesecake base"" for 10 mins in a preheated oven (325 ish). When done and cooled pour any of the above mixtures onto it no deeper than about 3 inches/ 6 cms ('ish).Put in freezer till 80% frozen and serve or take out 30 mins before serving for it to soften a little. Top with fresh fruit, dark chocolate grates flakes,  a spice dust, or toasted almonds or toasted unsweetened coconut flakes. 

UPDATE: 

A. If you don't have a blender, I still got your back!

Popsicle moulds, super cheap.
OR
A big Ziplock freezer bag, a bit more time consuming, and can have a few ice crystals but still delish. Make the mixture, put it in the freezer in the ziploc. Take the bag out every 30 mins or so and shake it. Eat when it hits a consistency you like!
Hope these treats bring you some joy and let me know if any of these help with you summer cravings!

B. Monkfruit sugar is in most large grocery or health food stores. You can sub in whichever sweetener you like. I just avoid aspartame and dont like stevia. 

C. Yes you can buy these products ready made in grocery store but I prefer whole foods and most people on keto have atleast  some of the ingredients above already on hand.

1lv4xvj,keto,It's working! Thank you r/keto!,"So last fall I went to my doctor and she suggested keto/fasting to help me get over this last hump to my goal weight.

I started my weight loss journey back in 2015 at 465lbs.

Over 8 years, I lost 250lbs, doing high protein and low carb, I was even in wrestling school/gigs, and just enjoying everything.

Then in 2023, I ran into back problems, found out I have mild arthritis in my spine, had to do PT, after PT I had 2 cancer scares, so my 2023-late 2024 everything was a mess, and I gained 40lbs back.

I started keto/fasting in October last year and dropped 25lbs in 6 weeks, then holidays came and it was also my birthday in December, so I took a break till January 2025. I gained some back again, but I was determined to get at things again till my doctor's apt (which is a week away)

I kept hopping back and forth on the scale not knowing why I couldn't get under the 240 mark, thanks to you all I was able to get over that mark, telling me I wasn't eating enough fat, so I don't eat chicken as much as I used to I am now eating more pork/beef and such.

So finally today I am down to 226 from 245 in the last 6 or so weeks!

I also managed to drop 8% body fat!

So I am here to say THANK YOU r/keto community, for all your help!

I am going to talk to my doctor next week about staying on keto for the rest of the year, and hopefully be at my goal weight come 2026!

I've been on my health journey since 2015, and I am finally seeing a clear end to losing all this weight naturally. It hasn't been easy, but even with my back problems I gotta live with, I am determined to finish what I started.

So again, thank you to all of you who have posted/commented and helped me along this journey. I greatly appreciate all of you!

I used to wear 6x plus sized clothes, now I am in L/XL in regular sized clothes!

My weight gain came from an abusive relationship I was in when I got outta high school for 5 years, thinking it was normal after growing up with abusive parents, I ate my feelings a lot and gained 300+ lbs, didn't help I worked at a coffee shop that offered free donuts/soda etc to staff, but I am so glad I got out of that hell over 22+ years ago =) Just took time working on my esteem/confidence and such before starting my weight loss journey, what woke me up was my husband on our 10 year anniversary saying he was worried about me, even more so after we had a doctor who almost unlived me with misdiagnoses all those years ago!

My hubby and I celebrated our 20th this year and I couldn't feel better! Looking forward to this life change for the rest of my life, being healthy and all the stuff that follows!

1lsvucn,keto,What’s really the amount to stay in ketosis?,"I’ve been doing a low carb diet ranging from around 40-90g carbs for past 4 days and I’m obviously aware that this doesn’t put me in ketosis (at least not as easily) however I actually feel good. I eat enough sodium and potassium. I don’t really feel tired at least so far. 

I’ve been planning on doing keto but the foods I eat I end up around 35-45g net carbs. The reason why is because my diet consists of lots of salad, dressing, pre cooked chicken breast, some days I’ll have lavash bread and make a a chicken wrap, eggs and lastly because of sugar free coffee creamer.

I know that I shouldn’t have this or that and whatever but these foods are what make low carb possible for me. They make it easy, convenient, easy to prepare , and this way I have the perfect amount of electrolytes (sodium/magnesium) without needing to measure lite salt before the gym because I feel so drained or without having to buy expensive ketoade. Especially because of the pre cooked chicken breast. 

Plus I just know if I eat just meat, cheese, and force feeding myself fat, based on my experience it does not keep me as satiated as i’d like. But with these foods genuinely make low carb easy for me. My question is, how likely am I to stay in ketosis ranging from 35-45g carbs? My activity level isn’t consistent.
It just seems like low carb is so easy I might as well just do keto if I can.  But how will I know if 35-45g will get me and keep me in ketosis? 

Again so far I feel fine but it’s only been like 4 days. ",2025-07-06 07:57:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lsvucn/whats_really_the_amount_to_stay_in_ketosis/

1lplbin,keto,5 Week Challenge,"I (24F/5’6” SW: 200.8 CW:194.8 GW: 170) gained around 40lbs over the past two years.

If you have had success after 30-45 days please share your stories!

**Please do not comment with any advice to discourage me, it’s only a month so I don’t think this will be damaging. I know it is not sustainable long-term.**

*(BACKSTORY)*

I felt healthiest around 150-160lbs, which is where I was from age 19-23. I went through a lot of lifestyle changes at age 22-23 (moved countries, full time job, doing university classes), but I only noticed myself gaining weight around Oct 2023 after a doctor’s visit weigh in. I was at that point 180lbs. For some reason, I decided to avoid the issue entirely. I did not want to face the fact that I was getting so heavy again. By Aug 2024 I was 200lbs. I had not weighed this much since I was 16/17 years old. I still continued to avoid the issue. I struggled a LOT with body image issues and self esteem as a teenager, so I think I was probably avoiding it as a coping mechanism.

I really need to make a change. This is so hard for me to accept and follow through with. I will be 25 this August, and I don’t want to start this phase of life weighing over 200lbs. Especially since everyone always says after 25 it becomes a lot harder to lose weight.

*(5 WEEK KETO CHALLENGE)*

I am starting over this challenge July 1st. First attempt was May 27th, but due to various factors (lack of preparation on busy work days, my boyfriend's birthday, and trying to develop a healthy social life again) I fell off on week 3. I managed to get to 191.8 within the first 16 days, which was good progress to me. I believe if I prepare and stick to a plan, I can achieve good results. It’s 100% a mental challenge.

My intention is to use this as the starting point, and then follow a more sustainable eating plan at the beginning of August. I’m going to keep it very simple:

**Lunch**: 300-350g beef with broccoli OR 4 eggs with 4 slices of bacon

**Dinner**: 300-350g chicken OR beef with broccoli

**In between**: Diet sodas and black coffee

**Exercise**: Week 1 won’t be too active, but I am going to try to hit 10K steps most days, and eventually incorporate weightlifting and moderate/high intensity cardio.

I’m posting this now to keep myself accountable, but I will come back with updates!

1lpjx72,keto,Struggling to eat enough calories and fat- I really need advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping for some advice and support. I weigh 235 lbs and am 5feet 6inches. I started my diet after fasting about a week ago. My supplements I take are BCAA, Electrolyte pills, MCT oil, a women’s multivitamin, sometimes Lipsomal Vitamen C, and my protein powders that I put in black coffee and water. 

I have terminal stage 4 breast cancer and some liver problems, and I am also obese. I started keto mainly for weight loss, liver repair, and to help fight my cancer because I’ve heard from many people and research that it helps fight cancer. 

Right now I’m having a hard time eating enough calories and fat each day. I do hit my protein goal and keep my carbs at 20g or under daily (I count total carbs, not net carbs), but my fat and overall calories are usually low. I exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every day on a split treadmill that keeps pressure off of my joints because I have holes all over my body left from the tumors that have been eradicated successfully with chemo and some radiation. 

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I’ve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I want to make sure I’m doing this safely and effectively, especially given my health conditions. Does anyone have tips for eating enough fat and calories on keto when you just aren’t that hungry?

Thank you all in advance for your help and kindness.",2025-07-02 01:59:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lpjx72/struggling_to_eat_enough_calories_and_fat_i/

I've been low carb for 5+ years, low added sugar since Jan 2024 and have earnestly been kero since the new year. I have always had a strong sweet tooth and truly thought that eliminating added sugar and fruit would make me more sensitive to sweets, to the point of losing the cravings. 

Instead, I think I've confirmed that I'm just addicted to sugar, lol. Once I have a bit of anything remotely sweet (I'm talking cheese/nuts/PB/dark chocolate/ berries) I really struggle to stop. 

Parties and social gatherings are the hardest and I've started to cope with that by sipping a black coffee or other zero cal drink to keep me occupied.

1ldt0e6,keto,Factor Food and Keto,"I (58F) decided to try Factor for 3 months mainly because it would provide portion control. I ate 2 Factor meals per day, plus coffee with cream and one package of ChocZero Speculos cookies. Here are my results:

The Good: I lost 18 lbs in the 3 months (206 to 188 lbs)The food is very tasty and filling. I was concerned about the relatively high carb counts (15-18 carbs per meal) and calories (650-750 per meal) which was higher than I had done when on keto in the past, but my weightloss has been pretty steady. A big whoosh and then one lb. per week. It was easy to stick to because the food was good and I had a variety of meals to choose from. It was really convenient. Microwave for 3 minutes. Very few dishes to wash (mainly silverware) as I eat out of the plastic tray. Deliveries arrive on Monday. 

The Bad: It's a bit more expensive, but not as much as I thought it would be. My grocery shopping involves picking up creamer and coffee so a lot of money saved there.

The Ugly: There is so much waste. Plastic containers, which I recycle, weren't bad, but the insulation and ice packs have to be thrown away. The stuff in the ice packs can't be put down the drain. I checked with local food pantries and other places to see if I could donate them, but no luck on that front.

I am going to stick with it for another 3 months and see if the relatively high carb counts and calories slow my weight loss over time.",2025-06-17 17:18:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ldt0e6/factor_food_and_keto/
1ld39lc,keto,Constipation on keto,"Started keto a month ago. All has been well. I've been eating the same thing every day and the same supplements and water intake, regular bodyweight exercises. I've been going to the bathroom regularly. 

A few days ago I ran a little bit for exercise and sweated in the Florida heat, and also spent time in the park with my dog and was sweating a lot too. Not dripping head to toe, but made a patch apppear on my shirt. Nothing crazy but I also drank a about a liter or two less water for a couple of days too. Anyway I became constipated and haven't been able to recover after increasing water and electrolytes. 

I feel like it came on super quick due to dehydration and potentially electrolyte loss. I know I'm still early days into keto and this kind of thing might improve. But this seems a drastic response from my body. 

Any ideas, tips or tricks? 

EDIT

Some people have requested my diet so here it is below. However, as I mentioned I don't think it's that relevant because I was eating this exact diet daily for an entire month and have been going to the bathroom regularly. Better than ever. It was just a couple of days of more sweating and less water and boom I'm in a pretty bad spot and I'm pounded water and  bumped up the electrolytes with no success. 

Water-
4~ water 
Juice of 2 lemons

Supplements-
600mg potassium 
130mg magnesium (magnesium causes depression for me so I try to get in msg rich foods)
(Camu camu) 600mg
Benfotamine 200mg most days but not all
P5p 100mg few times a week

Breakfast -
4 slices bacon
1 sausage
Liver 1oz 
Half avocado 
3oz sheep feta
6oz cauliflower
3.3oz of a mix of bell peppers, onions, sprout and mushrooms with salt and olive oil. 
Veg cooked in the bacon grease and I add a tablespoon on MCT as well and lick the plate clean. 

Lunch- 
All the same as breakfast but broccoli instead of cauliflower and instead of bacon, sausage and liver I have a 10z decently fatty ribeye and as much salt as I can get between two fingers and a thumb.

Dinner-
3 slices of bacon 
1oz cheese
Kale cooked in the bacon grease with 19z MCT

Coffee with half cup of heavy cream, tbsp of mct

1tbsp cocoa, 1 tsp maca, half cup heavy cream, 1 scoop collagen with hot water.

1la25ko,keto,I finally started again. Day 3!,"tl;dr just sharing my journey and looking for tips and tricks.

Well, I finally committed to starting this again. The last time I did it was way back when they called it Atkins. It’s been a long time coming. 

Back then, my mom and I did it together. We worked together 5 days a week so it was nice to have that support system at work and we both did very well on it! My mom lost 50# and I lost 25#.. we got to where we could share jeans!!

One of the biggest challenges for us though is we worked in a restaurant. I had to cook the food and also (obviously) sometimes taste it for quality control and that was a special kind of torture sometimes! But we got really good at coming up with yummy omelettes and other low carb stuff. (I actually have a tasty recipe that’s very low carb if anyone is interested)

I’ve always had my coffee with cream and sugar and that was really tough for me to deal with back then. I hate the taste of artificial sweeteners so I just used extra cream. Breads, pasta, rice, potatoes.. those are my kryptonite.

But like I said, I did it back then and it was a struggle not having a proper burger or having my coffee taste delicious how I like it. Fortunately I love meats and cheeses and veggies so that helped.

Well now I weigh like 60# more and while I’m not obese or even fat by some people’s standards, I FEEL fatty (fattish?) and I’m just sick of it. I’ve been thinking about doing it again for a while, even been drinking my coffee without sugar for the last few years.

This time feels kinda different to me though. I actually decided to start drinking my coffee black. Not because I love the flavor, but because I want the wake up juice and I don’t need to have special princess coffee every day (or multiple times a day!) and it’s been totally fine. I think since I decided that’s how it’s going to be (and I fully accept it) I don’t have the yearning for it.

Back in the day, they had low carb bread but it was tasteless cardboard. These days there are so many options for low carb breads but I’m honestly not really into that either, so I’m just going without. I did try to get back on this a few years ago and was buying low carb buns and bread.. it was actually pretty great!

But when I fell off the wagon I still had about a half package of each and every time I went to throw them away, I couldn’t do it because I noticed they weren’t molding and it became kind of a science experiment. I have had those bags of “bread” in my fridge for almost 3 years now and not one spot of mold. They’re even still soft (ish). So yeah, I’m gonna pass on that whole deal.

I guess I’m posting because I’ve been lurking here for a while (joined a few months ago or so) and I really appreciate the support system and great ideas I’ve seen here and I need that right now.

I would love to hear your tips and tricks and experiences!",2025-06-13 00:12:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1la25ko/i_finally_started_again_day_3/

I only have my coffee (coffee, stevia, zero sugar creamer, 1/2 tbsp butter, until noon every day when I eat a small lunch. Then I eat dinner. I track everything I eat. I stay under 20 net carbs for the last 4-5 weeks and under my 1550 calories intake. 


My issue is I’m gaining weight. I haven’t had the flush of initial weight off. My husband says he can see it but I just can’t and the scale tells me the opposite. 

Does anyone maybe know a trick I can do to jump start? I had blood work done for the doc a few weeks ago and it showed I’m in ketosis. I have the funny taste in my mouth, I drink water like it’s going out of style. Leafy greens every day, lean meats. 

I just feel very discouraged from the last time I’d done keto years ago and saw results. ",2025-06-05 11:26:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1l3wrg5/4_weeks_and_no_loss/
1l3cgf8,keto,Keto not keto’ing,"39F, 5’8”, 175lbs when I started three weeks ago, now 172. Would love someone to look at my Keto and supplement stack and make any biohacking recommendations. 

I did keto for three months four years ago and lost 30lbs and kept it off for about two years. Had a relationship recently where our favorite thing to do was go to our pizza spot and have a pitcher of beer. Gained 20+ lbs in a year doing that, but it was fun. 

I’m back on Keto in three weeks being super strict and not seeing much movement, although it does feel like my waist is getting smaller. 

I lift weights 4-6 days per week. I sauna at least 20 minutes after lifting. The few days I don’t lift, I’ll sauna and cold plunge cycle for an hour. Steps are 8-12k/day. 

None of my supplements have carbs, mostly soft gels or capsules. 

Supplement / Food Stack
- Colostrum in the AM 30 mins before food and coffee, with collagen, creatine, and sometimes electrolytes. Vitamin C powder for collagen absorption. 
- Keto Coffee with Ghee, salt, MCT
- Multi vitamin (Ritual), fish oil, CoQ10. 

Go lift and sauna. Go to work. 

- Low carb protein shake
- Lunch, usually a salad with primal dressing and protein and cheese (everything weighed and put into LoseIt app)
- Magnesium Citrate (for digestion), Vitamin K2, liver support. 
Walk steps after lunch. 

Home and bone broth + collagen + ghee again at night. Sometimes canned salmon and primal dressing or I just fast. 
- Magnesium glycinate and biotin before bed.  

Lots of water throughout the day. More electrolytes if it’s a big sauna day. 

Sometimes keto bread and grass fed butter if I’m feeling snacky (Orowheat). 

I’m wearing an Oura ring and just into biohacking at the moment. But I’m not seeing much scale movement, but maybe it’s because I’m working out more and building more muscle? What should I adjust? Any red flags here? I’d love to get back down to 150 but three lbs in three weeks of strict keto is discouraging, although it has made my brain super sharp so I’ll keep up with it.

1l20csq,keto,First Days on Keto and Questions about Macros,"Hello everyone! Hoping this doesn't turn into a dump of a post but I wanted to share my thoughts after a week (12 days so almost 2).

I had tried the keto diet in the past and it was amazing, although I never really tracked anything and I'm pretty sure I was starving myself. But I did go down to around 265lb from my starting weight of 318lb. This was a few years ago and since then I gained back a bunch, up to 350lb and had gotten diagnosed with type 2 IR diabetes. I started making more home meals with healthier options and cut out sugary drinks, and got down to 320, and with exercise down to 310. That's where my latest journey is starting.

I went in for a liver biopsy (had autoimmune hepatitis ...or not, idk my latest result showed no sign, but my fatty liver was bad and had stage 3 fibrosis.) Im only 22 and honestly this is really scary for me, so I wanted to make a much needed change in my weight and decided to try keto again due to my results the first time, and all of the positive stuff I've heard about it for managing fatty liver and diabetes.

On to the fun stuff...these last two weeks were definitely much easier starting out then the first time. First of all I prepped a lot of meals and had plans set out for what I wanted to make. I think I underestimated the amount of delicious food I can have on this diet.

I've been only drinking water with my electrolytes, and occasionally a sparkling ice water or coke zero...although I'm trying to cut the soda out entirely. I want to continue the sparkling ice water to have some semblance of good flavor...but I may also just get a homemade carbonation machine and add some mio flavoring to water.

Truvia has become my new best friend for anything sweet. I use erythritol for some cooking but it seems to leave a strong long lasting after taste in my mouth that I'm not a big fan of. 

I've been keeping a close eye on my glucose and ketones (mostly just because the keto mojo came with both strips). I don't care too much about the ketones in the blood as long as they are within the normal range, and my glucose seems to be mostly steady between 80 and 100. Occasionally I'll have to have a beef stick or something to raise it if I'm in between lunch and dinner and see it go below 80.

Overall I'm really happy with the new energy I've been having. Im really trying to go to like 220lbs if possible...and I've started exercising around 30 minutes a day, biking or walking. Also trying to live a more active lifestyle by camping and doing more cleaning, yarn work, etc. I still work in an office sitting, but this is still a major change in my lifestyle that I never thought I'd be able to keep up with.

I read up on the macros and calorie deficit...and I just wanted to make sure I am doing good with what I'm having. Usually, for breakfast I've been having coconut ghee coffee, and my lunches and dinner contain mostly protein and some fat. I downloaded a tracking app and it looks like I go way over the protein limit, and under fat and calories. According to what I've read for weight loss on keto, this seems to be alright though. I also seem to be missing some of the other targets and just wanted to make sure I'm not missing something horrible. Gonna send the pictures below all the rest of this of my tracking for today.

Really appreciate any advice, comments or questions yall can provide. Im new here but I plan on making keto/low carb a major part of my life for a good amount of time if not indefinitely so might be here a while silently browsing the community.

1fy1hqn,vegetarian,Soya milk sometimes curdling in coffee?,"I’m just wondering why this only happens sometimes? Back in the 90’s it was common for plant milk to curdle in coffee and you’d have to warm it gently, stir it at just the right speed, and often chant an incantation to keep it together. 

Now it rarely happens, but I don’t understand why. I always make my coffee the same - cafetière coffee with cold Alpro Soya Light. 99% of the time it’s fine, and then occasionally it splits and I have to chuck it down the drain. 

Any idea why? It’s just odd. Yesterday using the same carton of milk my coffee was fine 🤷🏻‍♀️",2024-10-07 06:47:50,https://i.redd.it/fqd43jfo6atd1.jpeg

One night for dinner, we got delivery from Planta Queen.

An upscale vegan restaurant with VEGAN SUSHI. Everything they had there was amazing. There were tom yum/sweet corn dumplings, Bang Bang Broccoli, General's Cauliflower, and more. Just excellent food. We had a dragon roll which is some of the best sushi that I have ever had, period. I want to go back and try more sushi because it's one of the things that I really miss since going vegetarian.

Another place we tried was called SoBe Vegan, which was right on the beach. It's a vegan burger and fries place that seemed a little more geared to the Instagram crowd than I normally like but quite honestly had one of the best burgers that I have ever had.

qa99af,vegetarian,Teas to spike with juice from fruit,"I've gotten away from soda pop and it's improved my health.  I did it by every week making a whole bunch of black tea in a coffee maker.  I'm a non-coffee drinker, not out of any kind of principle.  I just hate coffee.  Anyway, a coffee maker will make tea if you choose to.  

This has worked to get me off soda.  However, now I want to change thing up a bit.  I'm just getting a little tired of black tea.  That coffee maker will make other types of tea as well, such as green tea.  Plus, I have plenty of various herbal teas.  There's one other thing I wondered about.  What about squeezing the juice out of some types of fruit and spiking my tea with that.  I don't mean go half/half.  That would get too sugary.  But what if I had several pieces of pineapple that I just crush and let the juice go into the tea?  Maybe there are some other fruits that go well with tea.  Of course, it's common to put lemon juice into tea.  

What types of tea taste good with a little boost of fruit juice?  And what fruits should I use.  I'm thinking I might try green tea and then crush some pineapple, letting those juices go in.  Any other ideas?  

If I wanted to I could just buy a big old jug of grape juice, but that would get very sugary.  The idea instead is to make some good tea -- a whole coffee pot full -- and then use some fruit to give it an extra umph.

ohup87,vegetarian,Changes to my mood and mental clarity,"Hi folks! First time posting here. 

I never intended to have more of a vegetarian focused lifestyle, it just seemed to happen over the years. 

Red meat and poultry always smelled horrible to me while they were being cooked, but I ate it anyway because I was used to it. I began to stop cooking those meats, as well as pork, and I focused more on the stuff I enjoyed like; fruits, veg, legumes, and fish, the kind of stuff I was introduced to from a young age by my Italian grandmother. She taught me how to cook, so my diet is very Italian influenced. 

It’s been months since I’ve eaten a land animal, I can’t begin to recall the last time I had meat, and maybe it’s just a coincidence, but I’ve noticed my emotional regulation, thinking, understanding, have all become clearer, sharper, faster, and better managed. I truly feel different mentally, and sometimes I feel energy in my body that reminds me of how I feel after a cup of coffee, but I hadn’t had any. And I often feel genuinely happier.

I’m wondering if anyone else has similar experiences. I’m also wondering if anyone has any dietary recommendations for well rounded nutrition.

ofl4tc,vegetarian,"Surprises and bumps along the way, trying to go vegetarian","I need to get myself fully onto a health-oriented vegetarian diet and am encountering some surprises, some welcome and some not.  First, I've totally busted the myth that the veg food can't be tasty or satisfying.  I invested in some cook books and have found this [vegweb.com](https://vegweb.com) web page for some really good food.  When I cook, the food has usually ranged in quality from pretty good to outstanding.  I was already good at cooking from before, so that's a plus.  So that part is a welcome surprise.  

Now here's the unwelcome surprise.  We humans are creatures of ingrained habits, and I'm 56 years old.  It's a bit late in life to be making this drastic change, but I must do it.  I'm prediabetic, 100 pounds overweight, and want to prevent getting full-blown diabetes.  While it might be possible to get the weight off and improve my health without going vegetarian, from what I read, this gives me the best advantage.  Plus, I've never been fully at peace with hurting animals.  When I was a kid, I caught a fish on our deep sea fishing trip.  I only caught one while others were catching a lot of them, but I honestly felt bad watching the fish die on me.  And then the one and only hunting trip I went on made me feel terrible for the poor creature that had to suffer.  I kept my mouth shut, as I knew my friends would mock me for worrying about that.  For much of my life the eating meat thing has just been on autopilot.  You do it because you grew up conditioned for that, not because you ever specifically chose it.  

Now I have serious and compelling reasons to get myself fully vegetarian.  I must find a way to make this happen, despite the considerable resistance from force-of-habit.  

The big surprise has been how hard it's been to get away from what I call the ""go-to guy"" foods.  These are all the foods that are easy to make and are often cheap.  For example, those Chef Boyardee canned foods like ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs, etc. are dirt cheap and easy to prepare.  They barely cost any money, and you must put them into a bowl and microwave them.  Quick, easy meal.  Same thing with ramen noodle soup.  All you need is hot water, which you can often get from a coffee maker or just microwave it.  

In short I'm doing well when I'm able to plan a meal to cook.  I've made some Japanese miso soup in a slow cooker that was not too hard to make.  I made some not just meatless, but also cheese-less lasagna that was very good from one of the vegweb recipes.  When I'm able to take the time to cook, I'm doing okay.  It's the stop-gap meals that I'm having a tough time with.  You don't realize that you build up a repertoire of habits that are basically on autopilot.  Hungry – need a quick, cheap bite to eat?  That canned ravioli takes care of the hunger easily without costing much.  It's a go-to guy meal that I've done automatically for years.  Plus, it has a nostalgic feel to it, since it was a mainstay that my mom made for us when I was a little kid.  Certain meals get ingrained into you, and thus get very tough to let go of.  I'm surprised how hard this part of it is.  I was expecting the resistance to be from things like T-bone steaks and home-grilled burgers, but those honestly haven't been so tough to let go of.  

I think the toughest thing is I don't have a pre-programmed repertoire of cheap and easy foods that I can do without thinking.  But I need to throw out all these meat-based quick meals.  I need something else to do instead when I don't have time to meal plan and cook.  

I'm guessing others have been through this before.  Hence, my post.  I appreciate any advice on filling in the gaps for when you need easy and quick meals.  I'm hoping that with some experience it becomes easier.  Basically, what I thought would be hard hasn't been, and what I thought would be easy (or didn't really think much about) has been hard.  

I've got to get over this hump and into the full-time vegetarian thing.  My life literally depends on it.  It must also be health-based vegetarian.  I'm aware that it would actually be possible to be a vegetarian with a poor quality diet.  I need a good quality one.  I appreciate any advice that might help.

I eat a lot of tempeh, lentils, beans, nut butters, and eggs as my main sources of protein. However, I always have carbs to accompany that whether it is rice, quinoa, pasta, toast, or sweet potatoes. I do eat vegetables with at least two of my meals but I mostly snack on fruit, protein bars, and the occasional sweet treat (cookies or flavored iced coffee).

My weight is fine, cholesterol is great, as well as any vitamins tested. For anyone who has been in a similar position, what did you do to help yourself? Should I cut back on carbs or add meat back into my diet? As far as snacking, what do you find keeps you full for a long time?

mjyp16,vegetarian,Have any of you experienced depression at the start of going vegetarian?,"I went vegan in September of 2020 for ethical reasons, however, in December I discovered that even though I had been taking vitamins the entire time I was vegan, I had severely low B12, Vitamin D and iron. So low that we are talking iron infussions, b12 injections, and prescription strength vitamin D. I switched to vegetarian in the hopes that it would help with these deficiencies and help me feel better. My iron and B12 are back up to normal, but my vitamin D has barely increased even with prescription strength vitamin D,  using Vitamin D milk in my coffee every day and getting outside more. I have realized that i have been moderately depressed these last 6 months of so(diagnosed by my doctor and therapist), this is the first time i have ever experienced depression in my life and I wonder if it is connected to being vegan and then vegetarian. Its hard to know though because I have been pretty isolated due to Covid and the few friends I had have moved away, so that could influence it as well. I also have some autoimmune diseases that my doctor said can affect my vitamin levels, so its not necessarily due to me not getting sufficient amounts on a vegetarian diet, just problems with my body. I am eating a mediterranean style dirt with lots of whole grains, legumes, and fresh fruits and veggies. I really dont want to revert to eating dead animals, I have never liked the idea and have been considering vegetarianism since childhood and I am really happy I made this choice, but I dont want to be miserable and depressed forever. My doctor said she thinks i would do better on a paleo or whole30 diet, but that seems to restrictive to do with a vegetarian diet as well. I guess I am just posting this because I am feeling really discouraged and I want to feel better without eating dead animals.",2021-04-04 15:46:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/mjyp16/have_any_of_you_experienced_depression_at_the/

kj98to,vegetarian,My reducing diet that really works and is healthy,"A long post but this is how I brought my weight down from 179 to currently 161 lbs. Probably going to shoot for the 150's, just to see how that feels. Will never go above 165 again.

Started eating straight vegetables and whole foods (with protein drinks). Starting shopping at Whole Foods, but cost is about the same, because I eat so much less food.

In the summer I buy local produce. Learn how to cook vegetables that don't need a sauce - these count as zero calories! Eat good quality raw vegetables (carrot, whole mini-cucumber, fresh radishes. Can dip them sparingly in Old Bay seasoning.) The raw veggies, I usually array on a cutting board after my meagre dinner of a shake and popcorn.

Use fitness watch to make sure daily exercise goals are met. Mostly brisk daily walking and seasonal aerobics like chopping firewood in the winter, or biking int the summer. I favor outside fresh air to gym air.

Below are the basic foods. Will use brand names in some cases because there is a significant difference.

(Breakfast or Dinner): Westsoy brand unsweetened soymilk - one cup. This gets combined with one scoop of Herbalife Dutch Chocolate and one scoop HempYeah! vanilla. 28 grams of 365 Reduced Fat & Sodium Popcorn. If at breakfast, also have a serving of fresh berries. Also 1/2 banana at breakfast. Also get pre-breakfast treat (see below).

Lunch is the taste chew and enjoy meal. One serving Ak-Mak sesame crackers. Usually have the crackers heaped with naturally low calorie Ethiopian bean ""dip."" That's just regular lentil curry that's cold. With beans I like to have 2/3 cup of cole slaw, preferably homemade. Tastes great, that's healthy cabbage, and 68 calories. Otherwise can make a big salad. Chop up the lettuce first and then whisk in one tablespoon of naturally low cal dressing, like Bragg Organic Vinaigrette. Can melt down a whole tomato very quickly using a ceramic (not teflon) non-stick pan. Try to get most of the skin out and season with a five-spice mix. This can be used as additional salad dressing. EVERY LUNCH HAVE: 1/4 cup of good quality peanuts (unsalted), walnuts, or cashews.

(Breakfast or Dinner): Glass bottle nonfat milk (one cup) with about 1 1/2 scoops of Herbalife Formula 1 Dutch Chocolate mix. Side of bagged 130 calorie popcorn.

When you get too hungry, fool your stomach with DECAFFEINATED hot tea and a jigger of 2% milk. One or even two lifesavers or other low-calorie hard candy (but don't go crazy with them). And remember, you have that large navel orange and apple with cheese in reserve.

TREATS! After your weight starts coming down, treat yourself to dessert of 14 g of good quality dark chocolate. PRE-BREAKFAST treat: Every morning, I eat 1/2 box Barnum's Animals Crackers (130 cal.). Buy these by the case on Amazon. I have these with espresso made with fresh ground DECAFFEINATED coffee beans.

EVERY DAY EATING WHOLE ORANGE OR GRAPEFRUIT. WILL ALSO USUALLY ALSO HAVE 1/2 APPLE, pared and sliced, with 1 TBL of shredded aged parmesan cheese (only 20 cal) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

SPECIAL EVENTS: For like a Thanksgiving, eat no more than a banana and fast until the big meal. Home in on the salad and bring your own dressing. Try a taste of different things - one spoonful of mashed potato, etc. Maybe one small roll. Cook and bring a sweet potato and black bean dish to share. Two narrow slivers of pie - hold the ice cream (or just a tiny taste). REMEMBER: YOUR STOMACH HAS NO TASTE BUDS! Keep the food in your mouth with a lot of chewing. Your stomach has no taste buds - it's just on the way to fat deposits from there.

WEEKLY SPECIAL EVENTS. Skip breakfast, and you can get a bagel at Panera with 2/3 of the container of cream cheese (whole fat don't mess with ""diet"" junk), and some preserves or jelly. A 16 oz. DECAFFEINATED Latte made with whole milk. When you go home you can collect your daily 1/4 cup of nuts. WEEKLY SPECIAL #2. Six inch veggie patty sub from Subway. On 9 grain wheat (lowest cal.) Choose either cheese or sauce plus anything else you want on it. Can be combined with 16 oz. latte - no sugary drinks ever ever. Also stay away from unnatural artificially sweetened drinks.

hp16j9,vegetarian,Where do you get your iron?,"Hi there.

Vegetarian of 4-5 years here. I recently found myself becoming SUPER lethargic and exhausted so made a trip to the doctors. Pre-vego my iron level was already low (around 15-20 on regular tests) but after giving up red meat with the exception of occasional tuna (don't @ me), my iron level had fallen to 9. I ended up having an iron infusion which made me feel much better! But it left me wondering -- where do other vegos get their iron? We are always asked about protein, but never iron. I have since asked doctor google and banished some bad habits (such as drinking tea/coffee with or near meals -- one source suggested tea consumption can reduce absorption of non-heme iron by up to 60%).

This is kind of sudden, me considering going back to vegetarian, i thought I'd be vegan forever but I just don't know now. Okay this is SO weird but what got me thinking about it was the other day I had a dream where I was eating these bomb-ass donuts, and they weren't vegan and it just got me thinking about how many times I've been craving non-vegan stuff in the past year or missed out on food that I reeeeally wanted to eat but 'couldn't' because I was vegan. I wish I had a less selfish reason for considering going back but tbh I just miss a lot of stuff! I have a big sweet tooth and want to eat Reese's cups again (the vegan ones I make just aren't the same), or just be able to go get a coffee anywhere I want because I can't drink it black. Also if you're Canadian I'm dying for an icecap and the one location, that isn't really near me at all, that has soy it's okay? But it's not the same. Also eating out with my friends is annoying, and it makes me anxious feeling like I'm being annoying and that I can't eat anything or sometimes have to eat before and just get a side of fries. And cheese! I used to love cheese. I'll never go back to eating meat but I don't think I want to be vegan anymore, but I feel conflicted.

g4gv3v,vegetarian,"3 years self expirementing, why I'm on the veggie diet for now on","I've spent 3 years experienting on myself with diet tends and food habits and I'd love to share what I've learned about myself.

I'm not a health professional or nutritionist, as I've been learning and testing diet tends on myself.

I am a 30 year old male diagnosed with bipolar. I used to be 200 pounds, now I weigh about 130 last I check. I beat obesity and this is how I did it:

I started on a low calorie vegitarian diet. All my drinks were zero calorie black coffee and diet soda or 10-25 calorie sparkling water and energy drinks.

Drinking too much caffiene on low calories gave me paranoia depression and fits of anger, so I highly recommend if anyone have a mood disorder and are trying to diet then keep caffiene low or none at all. Just my opinion, others might tolerated it better then some. 🤷🏻‍♂️


As for the food. High amounts of leafy greens, mostly raw greens. My favorite have been watercress, arugula, bok choy, baked onions and potatoes. The majority of my meals were just green. The high fiber helps me be full longer on less calories and the minerals are a plus too.

However, I did try keto. I'll say this..
While veggies help kick 50 pounds, keto kicked another 20 pounds. But after that, I always felt hungry.

I even tried carnivore diet with every other day fasting. Yes I was extreme. And I strongly recommend not doing this. On the carni diet I had to buy fiber Suppliment and vitamin and mineral Suppliment. severe constipation.
And it made me anorexic.

But since I'm a guy, no one was concerned about my weight, they met me with either jealousy or praise. It felt good but I was miserable..

So I ate more calories on the keto diet, but I still felt hungry.

So now I'm back on vegitarian, and I finally feel full. I got a little bloated though, and I'm sure I've gained some weight back on, but that's from switching diets and giving a break from fasting.

I'm still at an ideal weight, I'm not boney anymore though...

So yeah, that's my story. 😆

No I'm not a vegan activist. It's a diet not a religion. However I am scared of calories, does that make me anorexic?",2020-04-19 22:31:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/g4gv3v/3_years_self_expirementing_why_im_on_the_veggie/

fcbfbl,vegetarian,What to eat with iron supplements,"Since iron deficiency is apparently a common problem, I'm sure I'm not the only one struggling. Last week a doctor put me on iron supplements after a blood test. He was super uncommunicative and told me to read the medication papers, and to take the pills with something if I get an upset stomach.

Well, of course after a couple days I already have an upset stomach, so I imagine I have to take the iron with something. However the medications say to avoid the following foods because they block iron absorption: 

* milk and any milk products
* tea and coffee
* cereals, foods with fiber
* eggs

And apparently leafy greens have oxalic acid that blocks iron absorption. I imagine these are just to be avoided next to the iron supplement and not from the diet overall because otherwise it's a lost cause. I wouldn't mind just fasting for a couple hours next to the medication, but as I said, upset stomach.

Anyone got any ideas of anything (vegetarian) to eat that goes well with iron supplements?",2020-03-02 12:36:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/fcbfbl/what_to_eat_with_iron_supplements/

e26j56,vegetarian,1 month strict. Thoughts from a red blooded powerlifter.,"So I watched the documentary The Game Changers and finally decided to go all in on a idea I had been kicking around and that was to go vegetarian for at least a month.   The plan was to see how it affected my mood and energy levels and then primarily eat vegetables and consume meat only when I obtained it myself ""ethical hunting/fishing etc”.   

While I fully support the ethical decisions behind being vegetarian, this was more of a scientific experiment on myself to improve performance and daily function.

FIRST THE GOOD.  I found vegetarian food in restaurants to be amazing.   They were full of flavor and they didn’t make me feel heavy and bloated afterwards like some other meals do.   I found it easy to plan for meals throughout the week due to a wide selection of options.
 
MEAL PLAN

205 grams carbs
180 grams protein
70 grams fat

Height 71 inches
Weights 215

Squat 435
Bench 295
Dead lift 455

>Morning shake was a pea protein/cold brew coffee protein mix with some raspberries.

>Lunch was jasmine rice with black beans and seitan with verde salsa.  

>Protein bar before gym with almonds and peppers dipped in guacamole.   

>Post workout was 4 eggs with handful of spinach and a kale/mango/banana/vanilla pea protein shake. 

>Supplements were zinc, calcium, iron, b12 and melatonin 

-First dew days= high energy and immediate weight loss around 7 lbs.   I started at 215 and dropped to 209ish once everything was said and done.   My lifts stayed consistent but my mood was terrrrrriiiiblle.   Very pissy and grumpy.

-1 week in=adjusted food timing due to poor energy and lethargy during the day.  I was already taking b12 and iron and zinc/calcium/magnesium but I switched the timing to earlier in the day.  Mood still awful.

2 weeks in=mood levels out somewhat but energy levels still tanking hardcore.  No energy or motivation to clear my head by doing what I love, lifting heavy ass things.  

3 weeks in= weight comes flooding back in.   Back up to 215.   Mood is real bad and grumpy.

This week= lowest energy I’ve experienced in recent memory.   Poor focus and memory recollection.   No energy whatsoever for gym, even for light movements.  

I do not think this lifestyle is more me.   The mood and energy levels are a deal breaker.

\[Here's [that other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/dj3hbr/how_do_you_cook_for_a_family_where_1_person_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\]

Let me tell you a story.  
When meat-people (meeple) have their first real vegetarian interaction, it often goes something like:  
""Oh, you don't eat meat? But how can you come up with meals? I don't know how you people can eat salads every day.""

Awful story, right?

I'm a proud 1-year vegetarian (as of two days ago! Hooray!) I've maybe eaten somewhere between 15–30 salads the entire time. Instead, I've eaten stuff like pizza, pasta, nuts, curry, hummus ~~(more like yummmmmmus)~~, some amazing tofu, salsa, cereal, potatoes, rice, beans, chili, and a whole set of meals based off of fake meats and fake cheeses. 

&#x200B;

My point is, meeple fail to realize that most of the food they eat is vegetarian. Almost every side dish, the stuff you cook your meat in, the snacks you buy from the grocery store, the specialty drinks you like, most of your breakfasts growing up (unless you had bacon money, you filthy fatcats). 

However, our lovely marketing campaigns and old wive's tales passed down through generations have told our grizzly ol' ManlyMen™ that MEAT IS NECESSARY! I NEED MY MEAT! Although most people aren't really like this, there's an underlying vibe, especially in middle-aged to older generations \[in my experience\], that meat is an important part of every meal.   
It's definitely not, though. Realizing that is an important step to making vegetarian meals, and to nutrition in general.

&#x200B;

Now to the ~~meat~~ vegetable of my argument:

When trying to cook for vegetarians (or a mixed group), focus on the **staples**. If you're a mother in the same situation as the other poster, you're cooking for these people every day. Staples are global, things like grains and beans. And rice. And bread. You could feed your family nothing but rice and vegetables 3 meals a day, every day, and they'd be more-or-less fine for about a week (probably longer if their diet is mostly microwave hamburgers as-is). People legitimately do this, with the occasional fish. I wouldn't personally recommend it, but I'm not a nutritionist. (Fun fact, you could [live on potatoes and butter](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/potato-butter-diet/), to a degree).

Try not to worry about maintaining perfect nutritional value when changing your meals to vegetarian. Having a bit too many carbs is fine, or too much protein, or too much whatever, in moderation. Try to worry about getting your family used to the change in food first.

After you've figured out your favorite **staple**, move on to the **basics of nutrition**. This step is optional. Stuff like steamed veggie stir-fry, salsa on the side (nutrients! honest!), incorporating nuts and beans, etc. Get creative, and remember that simple ingredients can be easily made very interesting with a little spice and heat. In other words, change those steamed frozen veggies to a cayenne-cinnamon stir fry. Honey glazed? Yes please!

After the **staple** and the **basics of nutrition**, focus on the sides and **stuff that you're used to**. I like to be a little heavy-handed on the cheese here, but if you're cooking for a vegan this is where you gotta up your cooking skills and get those delicious nut mixes and *oh-my-yes-please*\-smoothies. Pro-tip: peanut butter and sunflower seeds. Your ""**stuff that you're used to**"" might be mac-and-cheese, mashed potatoes (with meatless gravy, please!), side o' beans, or like, I don't know what you and your family are into. Use some spice. Get some ideas from other places. Rice congee, fry up some edamame, make something spicy, I don't care. Get into it, and try to stay away from anything that your brain registers as ""hard work"", otherwise you won't want to do it. If you fail, just make everything into a stir-fry. Soy, honey, vinegar, spice. Fixes most mess-ups, if you like that flavor profile.

Ok. You have everything you need so far, but we're still worried about one thing. Well, I'm not. I'd be fine with just the above most of the time. But as a vegetarian, **staples+basics+stuffYou'reUsedTo** is pretty boring after a while, and kinda depressing.

So, it brings us to what meeple call ""**the protein**"". ~~Take it from me, that subconscious meat-requirement is hard wrought in that term. Calling it ""~~**~~the protein~~**~~"" in this context is often referring to the supposed lack thereof \[in vegetarian diets\], and is therefore just rude.~~ Here we have what people think of as protein (and is protein oftentimes), but is really what makes you full in a meal. From a nutritional point-of-view, you probably should eat some protein, but in this context, **the protein** refers to the thing that makes a meal satisfying and mitigates your hunger. Stuff like meat, tofu (and seitan and tempeh, other meat substitutes), thick starches (think sweet potatoes), 'shrooms, and nuts and such. This section is the last section in this because, from a mixed-group meal-making perspective, it should be the last thing you think about. Something I'd like to restate here is that **too many people focus their meals on the ""centerpiece""/protein, making the rest of the meal a bunch of half-baked (pun intended), boring, bland sides that might as well not be a part of the meal**. 

The order above is the order you should think about it, and even the order you should think about cooking it in, at first.

**STAPLES**

**BASICS OF NUTRITION** (optional)

**STUFF YOU**\[and your family\]**'RE USED TO**

**""PROTEIN""**

The reason to think is this order is because if you make the first three well, you can grill up some chicken or some tofu and throw it in, and the entire meal will still be delicious. You can't say it'd be the same the other way around. 

When you get used to this, obviously, you'll be a lot better at planning ahead. 

Remember to start off with things you recognize as easy. Some [sites and recipes](https://chooseveg.com/blog/7-protein-packed-vegan-dinners-thatll-fill-you-up/) can be tempting, but are you really going to put in five+ hours every day just so you can have ""quinoa balls with spiralized zucchini""?

&#x200B;

The inspiration post also mentioned her husband still hungry after eating a vegetarian meal. Here's my take:

I've been vegetarian for a year now and for a few months I didn't have a kitchen, so 70–90% of my meals each week would be rice, beans, cheese, and tortillas (from taco bell). **I was hungry**. The problem at first will be solved by just eating more. A few weeks going into a vegetarian or mostly vegetarian diet can be difficult for some people, and that feeling of hunger is often either one of two things. **(1)** The placebo effect, or **(2)** the nutritional balance just isn't quite there, and the gloriously overworked chef is doing their best but still needs some time to perfect their meals. Solve this problem by making more of whatever you can make delicious, so the eaters eat more. After the first few weeks, though, the body will be giving more accurate responses to the diet and that's when it's time to check out articles like [this](http://physiqonomics.com/fat-loss/) (child-friendly version [here](http://physiqonomics.com/the-best-fat-loss-article-child-friendly-version/)) and then aim for a certain amount of protein/carb/sugar/etc. in the meals. You know, do your best. Plus, with this method you can always throw some meat in at the end, no problem. Please use different cookware, though, if your eaters don't want meat cross-contamination!

&#x200B;

It may not feel like it, but reading this has made a huge difference already.

Below I've got some recipes and some foods that might not register as vegetarian the first time around. I put an asterisk\* near foods that are sometimes handled with cookware used for meat. For example, pizza\* is often put in the oven with one giant wooden spatula for everything, and sometimes the cheese pizza is cut with the same cutter as the meat pizza, without cleaning in between! This doesn't matter to all vegetarians, though. Always ask if you can. Obviously, in your own kitchen, it's vegetarian if you make it vegetarian.

&#x200B;

**These don't have meat!**

* Pizza\*
* Macaroni and Cheese (without bacon)
* Coffee
* Fruit & Vegetables
* Oreos (actually vegan, so honorable mention here)
* Most desserts
* Most breakfast foods
* Pasta
* Most sauces (beware of Asian sauces \[fish\] and Mr. GrizzlyMan's™ Meaty Meat sauce). Also, caesar salad dressing often has anchovies.)
* Tons of soups!
* Whole catalogs of Indian dishes.

**Some examples & recipes \[staples>nutritional>stuff you know>protein\]:**

* Bread > tomatoes, spinach, whatever > tomato soup, cheese > Ha I tricked you it's a delicious super grilled cheese! Put a slice of tofu or chicken in the middle to make an awesome grilled cheese tomato spinach sandwich.
* Bread > Nothing > tomatoes, cheese > nothing. That's pizza, baby. I put this here to remind you to not throw a million vegetables on it just because somebody is vegetarian. PLEASE.
* Lightly melted mushrooms > carrots or asparagus/some long crunchy vegetable > roast potatoes, or just bread the entire mixture > cashews, maybe some seeds.

   * Follow her recipe, but instead of vinegar (2-3 tablespoons), use orange juice and lime juice in an 80:20 ratio, up to about 3-4 tablespoons. Fry it up really well, and then grind up a dried ancho pepper (or two). A dash of ground cloves early on is also good if you have some. This recipe is amazing because you can mix it with Mediterranean spices (basil, oregano, etc.), and then ALSO mix it with ""Indian"" spices (cumin, marjoram, coriander, cardamom), and even some chili powder and paprika. Whatever you want. If you're doing both Medi and Indian spices, use cinnamon to bridge the gap. Really.

df54t2,vegetarian,Hemorrhoids after I stopped eating meat? :(,"Hey y’all. 

Experimented with vegetarianism every now and then since I was 16. A month here, four months there, etc. Never made it longer than six months because I’d get stomach problems and my BM would get wack as fuck. 

I’m 21 now and I’ve only eaten meat once or twice since March. It was fine for a while, then started to become a nuisance, and now it’s a problem. 

I eat processed foods from time to time (like veg burgs and other meatless options, and some junk food) but for the most part I eat rice, beans, and vegetables. 

Also, I do drink a lot of caffeine; usually the equivalent of 3-4 cups of coffee. And I drink all caffeine: tea, coffee, yerba mate, energy drinks. I also smoke a half pack a day and about 1g of weed, but I don’t think those things would interfere with my digestion that much. 

And my drug habits have been like that for the past 2 years or so. It’s only when I stop eating meat that I get these stomach problems. 

Can anyone offer me any advice? Like I’m seriously considering going back to eating meat because of how my health has been affected, even though meat absolutely disgusts me now and I plan on cutting out all animal products by the end of next year. 

My shits are literally holding me back.

&#x200B;

The system (my body) was working ok, then I introduced a change (became a vegetarian; allowed eggs and cheese) and then noticed over time a system issue (I was lethargic far more often than not; countering with massive amounts of coffee helped but was a work around, not a solution). 

So, a backed out the change (started up eating meat and anything else again) and now am back to where I was. Not lethargic all the time, but I still want to give up meat.

So! How to remove meat but figure out what went wrong? Stop meat but drink a protein shake every 12 hours is my current guess.

So I got bloodwork done in May, perfect. No issues. Around June I decided I didn’t really want to eat meat any more. I recently had dealt with an unrelated health issue and my blood work came back garbage and I’ve been instructed to eat a healthier diet. I’m flummoxed. My glucose level are great, but my liver enzymes are elevated, my blood pressure is sky high and I’m in a pretty gnarly state. My normal day consists of

Breakfast - carbmaster yogurt with fresh berries  and decaf hot tea instead of coffee

Mid morning - banana (if I’m hungry)

Lunch - some sort of veggie mix wether it be raw veggies with hummus or a homemade power bowl with mixed veggies, sometimes I’ll add a veggie protein alternative and I’ll add in some quinoa as well

Afternoon - almost always an apple

Dinner - steamed veggies and maybe some cottage cheese with a few seeds or nuts

On the days that I work my night job I might get a side of pasta with garlic and oil or some sautéed veggies for my dinner (maybe 2 next guys a week)

I’ve cut way back on alcohol as well, I don’t use any salad dressings either for my lunches. 

So I’m at a loss. What am I doing wrong?

9z2y4t,vegetarian,I tried a veggie keto/ketotarian diet for a month. Here's an overview of my experiences + results (plus some tips for doing it better than me),"Hey guys!

Shared this over at [**r/vegetarianketo**](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarianketo/) and it seemed to go down quite well with some folks, so thought I'd share it with you guys too if that's okay! 

**Some context:**

I've had autoimmune health challenges for a number of years and have experimented with a *bunch* of different diets in that time in an attempt to help relieve symptoms/take a degree of control over the issues (crohn's + seronegative spondyloarthropathy).

During the search, I recently stumbled upon Dr. William Cole's work - a functional medicine doc who combines plant-based eating with the principles of keto and autoimmune protocols.

**The basic principles of 'ketotarian':**

* At the base of the pyramid, there's a bunch of fat sources - avos, coconut oil, olive oil, nuts + seeds.
* Above that, fish, eggs, maybe some tempeh, and plenty of non-starchy veggies (leafy greens etc).
* Very small amounts of low-fructose fruit + starchy veg
* Less than 45g net carbs a day
* Avoiding any dairy, gluten, nightshades, grains + legumes because of the potential autoimmune issues.
* Eat slowly, mindfully + manage stress

**I recently did a 4-week experiment:**

Whilst I've played around with various autoimmune protocols before, they tend to be pretty meat heavy. I was looking for something that would give my gut + immune system a break, but was still primarily plant-based.

As ketosis itself tends to help with inflammation, it made sense to give this a try.

If nothing else, it would help me learn a bit more about my body, and hopefully give me a few tidbits to potentially help others in a similar situation!

[**Here's a video I made if you prefer watching things**](https://youtu.be/UscgAfhcJe4)

I've also included a TL-DW (too-long, didn't watch) summary below:

\--

**What I ate:**

A shed load of chia, flax, coconut oil, olive oil, coconut milk, leafy greens, stevia, nuts, seeds, eggs, avos, and fish. Super dark 100% chocolate. Some roasted carrots + beets here and there. A few berries now and again.

Plenty of water, some green tea and coffee.

Because there was a bit more prep involved than normal, I found that eating 2 meals a day was actually easier than three. So I'd fast til early afternoon, then have a big breakfast, a light snack late afternoon, then dinner late evening. This was the general formula I followed:

1. **Breakfast:** Pretty much the same every day. A big fat bowl of chia seeds, flax, hemp, hemp protein, greens powder, coconut oil, cacao nibs - soaked for a few hours with almond milk, then topped with almond butter, coconut milk and a few berries/squeeze of lime. \~1500 kcal
2. **Snack.** A handful of nuts, 100% dark choc, maybe some berries if I've skipped them at breakfast. \~200kcal
3. **Dinner.** Some form of protein - usually either poached eggs or some form of fish, baked. A homemade sauce - often a coconut creamy curry. A bigass salad or steamed greens, dressed with oil, seeds + avo. Then sometimes a small side of roasted veg or cauliflower rice if I hadn't already smashed over the net carb limit (which happened once or twice early on. \~1000kcal

\--

**The pros:**

* **Clear mind.** After the initial week or so, I found that I was less prone to brain fog throughout the day. Productivity levels increased, and I just generally felt a bit sharper.
* **Stable energy.** Maybe because my blood sugar was more stable. I wasn't necessarily constantly buzzing with energy, but kinda had this constant slow burn available throughout the day.
* **Recovery.** Because of the tendency towards inflammation, my recovery capacity after workouts had decreased a lot in recent years. I would have DOMS for days, and oftentimes a workout would easily trigger a flare-up that would last for months. During the keto experiment, I found I was able to recover a lot faster from light workouts, which meant I could be more consistent in the gym.
* **Body comp.** Not something I was necessarily aiming for, but I lost a couple a kilos - probably mostly water weight. But because I was able to train more consistently, I may have made some changes in muscle mass too - [before/after pic here](https://imgur.com/a/9qPnXNq)
* **Sleep.** Generally deeper, less prone to waking in the night.
* Flare-ups - I'm generally in a lot less pain. Less joint stiffness + better digestion. Pretty amazing really for such a short timeframe!

\--

**The cons:**

* **Food variability.** Can get a little repetitive eating fish, eggs and veggies. Not necessarily a big deal, but can take some getting used to!
* **Cost.** Eating mainly fresh produce can get quite pricey compared to smashing down the grains + legumes. But for me at least, it's been worth it!
* **Time.** Like with any diet, it does take some adjusting too! You've gotta be on it from a meal prep standpoint, or a have a solid
* **Super high-intensity training.** The few times I did anything high intensity (sprints etc) I did find that the normal energy reserve I have wasn't quite there. This may be because it was still really early days in terms of my body adapting to using fat as a fuel, and may improve in the future.

\--

**Things I'd do differently:**

* Be more organized with meal prep to prevent food boredom + stress.
* Prioritize rest during the first week or two as the body makes the transition to keto.
* Be more focused on hydration + electrolytes during the first week as the body sheds water weight.

\--

**Plans moving forwards:**

Dr. Cole advocates gradually upping your carb content to find your 'sweetspot', so I'm currently seeing how that goes.

I also recently had some food sensitivity testing done, so incorporating some of those findings too.

\--

**Overall thoughts:**

Super glad I gave it a try! As you can see from the lists, most of the 'pros' are super positive for such a short timeframe. And the 'cons' are largely logistical and could largely be avoided with a bit more planning!

I can't say what it would do for you, but if you do suffer from anything inflammatory related, it may be worth playing around with!

*Hope this has helped in some shape or form - any questions, feel free to gimme a shout!*

9l4t4k,vegetarian,I always seem to build muscle when I go vegetarian. Why is that?,"When I eat things (meat, whey protein, etc.) generally believed to produce the results a lot of us want (more muscle, slimmer mid-sections, thinner looking faces, etc.), my body doesn’t get there. But whenever I cut out meat, it always seems to. I think the only reason I don’t stick with being a vegetarian is I assume that once I reach my fitness goals I can go back to eating un/processed meats and dairy. Which sounds kind of stupid when said out loud... I think understanding the science behind why my body seems to reach the fitness goals I mentioned on a vegetarian diet would really help me stick with it. And I think part of me is unwilling to believe I have some meat sensitivity... Anyway, your thoughts and links would be immensely appreciated!


Things I’m eating: nut butters (strictly portioned), frozen vegetables (Costco’s stir-fry blend), eggs (lots of them), non-dairy milks, and coffee.",2018-10-03 20:05:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/9l4t4k/i_always_seem_to_build_muscle_when_i_go/
9jmp0n,vegetarian,"Former vegetarian back for round 2. Anorexia recovery, Cerebral Palsy, and digestive issues","Hi, all! My second attempt at vegetarianism began on Wednesday. A bit of background: a was vegetarian for over 4 years, but when I was 16, I began to have fainting spells (a side effect of restricting calories and Cerebral Palsy demanding too much of my deteriorating muscle mass), so I began to eat meat again. My anorexia got way worse. I remember the worst day. I was on 3 weeks of eating nothing all day but the smallest portion of dinner and two cups of coffee with milk. My parents were at a wedding that evening. The only thing I ate all day was a 190 calorie Lara Bar, split into the tiniest bites you've ever seen. I was freezing all the time and had extreme insomnia. To make matters worse, Cerebral Palsy already wrecks havoc on the body's digestive system and I was now going three weeks without going to the bathroom. I've been in recovery for nearly a month now and decided to come back to vegetarianism, where I feel so free within food, and it's been great so far. My stomach feels lighter, not like there's a pile of bricks in it every time I eat, and I feel really good and excited about food for the first time in a long time. I even had seconds at dinner last night, for the first time in about 3 years. I'm still struggling with digestion (pretty much laxative dependent at this point) and have a gastroenterologist appointment in November that will hopefully help sort that out. In the meantime, I'm extremely excited about this new lifestyle and can't wait to try all the yummy veg holiday foods. I leave this post with a few parting questions:

What are your favorite ways to get higher protein? (My muscles deteriorate quite rapidly due to CP)

Any ways I can help my digestion through food?

Your favorite mock chicken? (Specifically grilled style, that's fairly accessible. I live in a rural area.)

1irky6p,bodyweightfitness,How long until single push up?,"I (39F, 160lbs, 5’8”) have a goal to do a single push up, ideally before this summer when I turn 40. I’ve been doing a strength training class 3x a week for the last 1.5 years, but I still can’t do a single push up. We are currently doing bench press 1 day a week for this quarter, and my max is 4 reps at 90 lbs, which is less than 65% of my body weight. 

So…without making my life about push ups, is it realistic to think I’d be able to get there within the next 4-5 months? Since I’m already working out 3 days a week, I probably would only do a “push up workout” 2 more times a week. 

I can currently do knee push ups and I’ve done some incline ones leaning on my coffee table, which is about 2 feet off the ground (though doing 10 of those was challenging). I can also do negatives.",2025-02-17 14:23:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1irky6p/how_long_until_single_push_up/
1g2twz5,bodyweightfitness,Should I switch to calisthenics from weight training?,"I am a 34-year-old 5.4"" male weighing roughly 100 kilograms. Yes, Dark Red BMI. However, since last year, I have talked myself into some sense and have lost 25kg in the last year. Nothing fancy, but Clean Eating with Macros in Check, Resistance Training, Walking, and Water Intake have all contributed to my success. May be it would have been much better if I could care less about OTT series and concentrate more on my sleep. Now off course with gym training, and due to some bad technique in the early days, some injuries have occurred. So far, shoulder, forearms, knee, and foot and sizzled with tendonitis. I am not particularly strong, and to be honest, I suck when it comes to strength; I can't go heavy, for a variety of reasons, including 1. I work out on an empty stomach and drink black coffee 2. I follow a calorie-deficit diet, so I will not have as much energy as others who are in calorie-surplus. These are cute reasons, but I simply don't have the strength. My bench press is 30-40 kilograms with some reps. I could never go beyond that. I can't even do a two clean pull-up. Furthermore, I have a flat foot, which when combined with weight causes plantar fasciitis, so I am dealing with that as well. Every day, I apply balm to the body part that is hurting the most. I had poor knees as well. It's as if you name an injury, and I have it (mostly). It has become a pastime of mine to google pain sensations and try to figure out what injury I am suffering from at the moment. Despite this, I continue to go to my local gym every morning. I've been paying close attention to my form, breathing, and avoiding ego-lifting in recent months. I just wanted to give some context before asking one question.

Now the question is whether I should move to calisthenics. Of course, I need to take it slowly and start with a beginner routine until I feel truly comfortable. But will this help me lose fat in the same way that weight training would? My goal is still to lose at least another 15 kg. Or should I continue to weight train until I lose another 15kg and then transition to calisthenics?",2024-10-13 16:44:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1g2twz5/should_i_switch_to_calisthenics_from_weight/
1ft56yh,bodyweightfitness,PSA for the super busy people with not much time or space: you CAN do it!,"I just wanted to give my data point and share my routine as someone who has very little time to devote to physical fitness and with no real space for a home gym. I want the busy people with little space to know that you can pull training off and get a great and obvious improvement to your physique even if they may not be THE fastest or most optimal.


Background: I'm a working parent with working partner and small children. I don't have any good space for fancy equipment (part of the reason I was drawn to BWF in the first place!). I don't really have time to commute to/from a gym. I can't really leave the house in the mornings either, because of the kids. I've also never considered myself to be a particularly athletic person / into sports, etc. 


Lifestyle notes:

 * Passing out around 10pm-11pm
 * Wake up around 6:15am
 * Start workout in earnest around 6:30am. Usually wrapping up by 7:15am.
 * I shoot for 3x BWF workouts week. I don't think about it in terms of per-week or the particular day, though. More like just every-other-day, and try to take an extra day off after every 3 or 4 BWF days. 
 * I don't beat myself up if I miss a day or even a week (!) due to travel. I also don't beat myself up if I feel like doing less reps/sets or even a half-assed workout that day (still try to keep form good, of course) or even quit after attempting a push-up
 * I try to do 15-35min Cardio during off days. I do actually own an elliptical FWIW, but this is obv completely optional. I like it because I can't really leave the house in the AM for a proper run.


Equipment:

 * Pull-up bar (with wide grips)
 * Dip bars - widest I could find that are heigh adjustable, so I can also use them for doing rows
 * Happen to have an elliptical for Cardio (and legs to a degree), but this is obv very optional.


Diet:

 * I don't pay a ton of attention other than I try to make sure I get in a bunch of protein and minimize the refined carbs (also don't beat myself up for eating them, though). 
 * I treat myself to a premade protein shake on workout days. 
 * I did buy a can of whey protein which I mix into just water/milk/coffee in the morning on off-days. 
 * I try to eat salads for lunch on most days (bagged kits from grocery store -- sometimes toss in some sardines), snack on jerky, nuts, sardines, etc.
 * I think it's important to find stuff that you think is delicious and aren't just eating it stictly for the diet. E.g. Big fan of the blue diamond  bold habanero almonds that basically taste like BBQ potato chips.


Routine:

 * Stretching: back against the wall, move arms up and down along the wall. Rotate shoulders. Stretch wrists on floor in every direction.
 * Core holds, I shoot for 1min ea: plank, side planks, reverse plank, hollow-body-hold, that superman-looking thing on your stomach, and then hold myself over the dip bars. When I started out, I only did about 15-30 sec and worked my way up. Some days it's difficult to hold the full min for each, and I'll let the hold go and then get back into as needed. Again, I don't beat myself up.
 * Core holds is about 10-minutes total. Sometimes I'll try to do this the night before to save time in the AM.
 * 3x-4x circuits, where I basically just do a set of: pushups, rows, dips, and pull-ups. I try to alternate configurations with each circuit--e.g. first set of pushups are regular, second set are diamond. I'll switch how I hold the bar for rows and pullups, etc. I was doing maybe 5x-8x reps in each set. Now I'm closer to 10x-15x (sometimes with a quick break partway through). I have mostly plateaued and am happy with it.
 * I am currently NOT doing any squats, deadlifts, or other leg stuff--and TBH, I'm perfectly content with this. I actually love doing squats and deadlifts, but just don't have the space/setup for it and have been happy with my evolution. I should probably do more leg stuff, but I'm hitting my time-limit and am at least getting some legs in when doing cardio stuff.


All this is to say, I think it's absolutely incredible what one can accomplish with very little time, very minimal equipment, and the right mindset.",2024-09-30 20:08:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1ft56yh/psa_for_the_super_busy_people_with_not_much_time/
1fjcect,bodyweightfitness,Feedback on my Routine ,"Hello everyone,

I started light weight lifting and beginner bodyweight workouts at home about a year and half ago. Since March I’ve been training bodyweight more seriously at an outdoor calisthenics park.

I can currently do 12 clean pull-ups, 25 dips, and >30 push-ups. The skills I am currently aiming to unlock are muscle up and handstand. I have the strength to kick up and hold a handstand against the wall for 30 secs, so I’m mostly working on the balancing skill of it - I can hold one for max 5 seconds. I can do an explosive pull up to my lower ribs but I’m unable to do a muscle-up, so I’m currently working on the technique of it. 

Eventually I’d like to unlock handstand push-up, front lever, and planche, so I keep those progressions in mind. 

My current routine — which I started about 3 weeks ago: 

Pull Day:

1. Muscle up skill work: 10x explosive swinging  L-sits 
2. Chest to bar pull-ups: pyramid method: 5x of max reps
3. Inverted rows: pyramid method: 5x of max reps
4. To end: Attempt front lever tuck hold 5x, can barely hold this for 2 seconds 

Push Day:

1. Handstand skill work: kick up and attempt to hold, 10x. I also GTG quite often randomly during the week at home 
2. Pseudo Planche Push-ups: pyramid method: 5x of max reps  
3. Pike push-ups: pyramid method: 5x of max reps 
4. To end: tuck planche on parallel bars, can barely hold tuck planche for 1 second 

I jog to and from outdoor park: very light jog there, ~15 mins. Heavier run/sprint home. I don’t take any crazy pre workout, just AM cup of coffee and a spoon of honey for some energy boost. 

Typical weeks looks like (all AM):
1. Pull Day 
2. Push Day 
3. Lite Leg/core workout - rest upper body 
4. Pull Day 
5. Push Day 
6. Kick boxing HIIT workout, which often involves some light push work
7. total rest, mobility stretches- maybe handstand GTG 

Just looking for any feedback or advice.  I’m a bit of a late bloomer in terms starting my journey as I’m 34. 171 cm, 160 lbs. 

Thanks in advance!

121mp79,bodyweightfitness,My workout routine,"I'm in my early 30s, and have been working out since I was in my early 20s w/ varying success, experimenting w/ bro-splits, PPL, full body, upper-lower. I workout at home w/ a power tower, a few heavy DBs & KBs, a suspension trainer, and bands. I'm 5ft 8in. I started in my 20s at 156 lbs and got to about 205 lbs, but then my wife's good cooking and kids happened and I'm currently at a stubborn 230 lbs. My goal is to get back down to around 200 lbs.

**Frequency:** Through trial and error I found full-body to be the best for me. As stated before, I'm married w/ 3 kids and I work a full-time job, so the traditional MWF pattern is impossible for me to follow, so I workout whenever I have the opportunity and take off days when needed or because of work or family obligations. Time is an issue as I train after work, so I prefer to keep my sessions 30 minutes or less.

**THE WORKOUT**

**Day 1**

1a. Dips (usually weighted)
1b. Vertical Pull (usually chinups or pullups w/ handle attachments. Traditional pullups aggravate my biceps and elbows)
1c. Single-leg squat/lunge (I like weighted Bulgarian Split Squats, step-ups w/ knee drive, or endurance reverse lunges)
(3-5 rounds)

2.. Optional isolation tri-set
(3-4 rounds)

**Day 2**

1a. Pushup Variation
1b. Row Variation (Usually heavy DB rows or inverted rows)
1c. Bilateral Squat Variation (usually heavy goblet squats or what I call ""pump squats"" aka 1 air squat followed by a 1 jump squat, which counts as 1 rep, for endurance)
(3-5 rounds)

2.. Optional isolation tri-set
(3-4 rounds)

**Day 3.**

1a. Vertical Press (Usually 1 arm KB or DB OHP or HSPU progression)
1b. Hip Hinge (Usually 1-leg deadlifts or KB swings, but I'll do bw leg curls or 1-leg hip thrusts w/ a chair for variety)
1c. Hanging Leg Raise progression (trying for toes-to-bar) or a weighted pullover v-up, both work the pulldown motion of the back as well as the abs
(3-5 rounds)

2.. Optional isolation tri-set
(3-4 rounds)

**Optional isolation tri-set:** Usually I like to include calves and sets for arms or shoulders. If I'm training outside in a park or somewhere similar, I'll forgo isolation exercises for sets of sprints instead.  

**Cardio:** My job is a busy one and has me on my feet all day, which I know isn't traditional cardio but it sure feels like it! At home it's family walks or playing w/kids outside 

**Diet:** I'm confident w/ my workout as it came out of years of trial and error. I usually eat the traditional 3 squares a day, i.e. breakfast w/ coffee, lunch and dinner. If I snack it's usually fruit, and I don't eat after 6pm. Desserts are only for holidays and special occasions.,If I'm honest with myself, I would say my biggest problem is diet, or more specifically portion control. I can eat a lot at once, which comes out of my upbringing where big portions were the norm as my parents and most of my relatives are overweight or obese. I try to curb it, but it's a struggle, especially around dinner time if I worked all day and came home and worked out. I deal with depression and sometimes emotionally eat, particularly chocolate.

If anyone has any advice on what I can do to improve my workout and/or tips to improve my diet it would be very much appreciated🙏. Thanks if you took the time to read this 😅",2023-03-25 14:00:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/121mp79/my_workout_routine/
wfwrjz,bodyweightfitness,[Beginner] Resting heart rate went from ~65 to ~80,"Starting Context

- height: 6 ft
- weight: 244 lbs
- body fat: 29% body fat

This was 2 weeks ago, I am obese. I put on ~60 lbs since the start of the pandemic - I replaced smoking with eating. My max at the start of the year was at ~260 lbs.

Also 2 weeks ago:

- I stopped drinking beer (or alcohol in general) and caffeine ( was having 1 coffee a day in the morning )
- started managing my food - ~2.2k calories, focusing on high protein, lower carb and lower fat
- started BWF primer (with a few extra exercises ) coupled with some mild running/walking 

I've dropped 6 lbs since, I could barely do 5 pushups 2 weeks ago and my lungs were killing me after jogging for 500 meters. Now I do 2 sets of 10's easily and did 5k in 40 minutes while keeping my heart rate at >140.

**One weird thing, which Apple Health pointed out and now noticed, my resting heart rate went from ~65 to ~80+ and is now consistently 80+. I'm just a little worried.** 

I feel great otherwise, I sleep good, my stomach is great, I don't feel tired or nauseous, I actually got more energy and just slightly less appetite (probably due to not drinking a beer with every meal) .. everything else is absolutely fine.",2022-08-04 09:32:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/wfwrjz/beginner_resting_heart_rate_went_from_65_to_80/
t7gwl8,bodyweightfitness,Space out/get bored during rest times between sets in RR making workouts too long,"Hey guys,

I am having an issue while doing the recommended routine, where I space out during the 90s rest times between sets and get bored/sluggish. By the end of the timer I am sometimes so spaced out that it takes me a while to get back into the next set--and as a result my workouts take a really long time, like 1.5 minutes to 2 hours.

I drink coffee before my workouts and I have tried listening to fast music, but it doesn't help.

I have tried just doing a gigantic circuit, where I do all of the exercises in succession as a super-set with no rest in between. This solves the spacing-out/boredom issue, but it is not recommended by the Recommended Routine, since it is recommended that one should start each set fresh from a rest to get a good rep count and maximize benefits.

What do you guys do to stay on track with the workout?",2022-03-05 19:30:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/t7gwl8/space_outget_bored_during_rest_times_between_sets/
rmghej,bodyweightfitness,Earn or overcome your bad habits with Exercise,"Hi folks,

I have for you some tricks/hacks I use to slow down my bad habits with exercise.

# Squats while brushing your teeth!

**Bad habit**: you brush for a very short time because it's boring.

If you use an electric brush, they usually have a 2 minutes timer. Do squats as you brush your teeth in the morning and at night. You'll actually end up lasting the whole 2 minutes and getting a great workout while at it!

# 7 minutes workout before that bad habit

**Bad habit**: that extra coffee cup, that first beer or alcoholic drink, have that cigarette, etc...

Before doing something you think is not good for you, earn it with a 7 minute workout :). Btw, if you have an iOS device, you can use a free app I wrote (Handstand Quest) with no ads to follow the 7 minute workout.

# Push-ups or core every hour during work day

**Bad Habit**: You work too much. In fact, the work day mostly goes from 8 am to 5 pm with you stuck in your chair or standing.

To get your body moving constantly and avoid back/next injuries, do your favorite exercise (ex: push ups, crunches, squats, stretches, etc..) every one hour throughout the day for as many reps you are comfortable with. Feel free to change it up and keep it to 1 minute max so you keep coming back.",2021-12-22 22:27:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/rmghej/earn_or_overcome_your_bad_habits_with_exercise/

Before  going to work I mixed a preworkout drink together, but  plans have changed so instead we need to go to the library instead. I drank it anyways, and now im studying with him in the library. but nowwww... I feel energized and really motivated to work with him! usually I don't like the tutoring aspect of  this job and it usually bores me to death, so i'm considering taking pre workout for uses outside of the gym. 

But is it ok ?  Idk if it's ok if I should treat this like a cup of coffee.. or is that ok ? I'm just tryna be cautious cuz I don't know much about it.",2021-09-30 19:27:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/pyqz8n/preworkout_for_not_working_out_l/

ppmxtk,bodyweightfitness,Help !!! I need advice fast !!!!!!,"Im 20 years old and I've been trying to lose weight for my brother's wedding. I've been working super hard these past 4 months, and it seems like I can't get the results I want. It seems since I've started I've been gaining more weight. I've asked my boyfriend whose is super into fitness, to help me find different workouts to target what I want. I've been trying to get leaner legs, arms and get rid of my gut area. I've been doing the workouts he suggested, and I always feel amazing after. I know I've worked hard cause I feel stronger.

Here's the problem. I do not see a difference in the way I look or in the numbers on the scale, and it's discouraging me. I thought maybe I wasn't doing enough with my workouts, so I've been going to the gym more. Nothing. I thought perhaps it's my diet, so I've cut back on my favorite things like coffee and tea—still nothing. I've added more fruit and vegetables to my diet, and still nothing. I've taken apple cider vinegar, and still, NOTHING is working.

It makes me feel so horrible about myself. I feel so ugly and feel as though nothing I do is gonna work. It's gotten to the point where I feel so ugly, and I just cried. I Don't know what more I can do. I feel as though I have to stave myself because I can't eat anything. It might be a problem with my body that it just won't give me the results I want. I'm not giving up on workouts and eating healthy, but something has to change. I can't keep feeling ugly and fat. Pls if anyone has advice ill take it 

I only have two months till the wedding, and I just want to feel pretty.",2021-09-16 21:49:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ppmxtk/help_i_need_advice_fast/
kz3snz,bodyweightfitness,3 month - 6 month progress post: RR only - (M/24/6'1) 155lbs-195lbs,"The recommended routine was a life saver for me. I got exactly the results I was looking for by doing the RR with minimal equipment. I started a couple months into quarantine. I've missed a total of about 4 weeks interspersed for either trips, work, or sickness. In addition to this, I also do full contact weapons sparring 3x a week which is my cardio. Here's my main progress over 6 months:

Pullups: 3x3 sloppy to 3x8 with emphasis on form. I think my pullup progression has been slow because I've been adding around 7lbs per month (it's water and fat, not muscle, I was chronically undereating so my weight exploded once I started to actually eat more than once a day) done on a pull-up bar from the thrift for $5.

Squats: 3x12 BW squats - 3x8 archer squats

Dips: 3x3 negatives to 3x10, all done on an old pair of bar chairs

Rows: 3x5 bedsheet method to 3x10 wide grip inverted on my dining room table

Pushups: focused mostly on form here. 3x12 normal to 3x8 pseudo-planche

Core: 30 sec plank to 3x8 knee ab rollouts with a $20 amazon ab wheel. Currently able to do 1 standing ab rollout.

I know my exercise progressions aren't where they could be, but I was looking for a consistent workout routine I could do from home that would keep me feel better after 3 years of being a hungry skeleton. I wanted something that didnt eat up all my time and wouldn't impede my ability to do my weapons fighting. The RR routine was perfect and gave me exactly what I was looking for. I feel incredible, I'm much stronger, and my partner has been thrilled with the modest amount of muscle I've put on. 10/10. 

Diet was eating anything I could get my hands on. I limit my fried food and sugar but I do enjoy a good popeyes chicken sandwich and a cinnabon once in a while. I otherwise almost exclusively eat chicken, turkey, fish, simple carbs, peanut butter, beans, rice, and fruit. I don't drink soda or fruit juice and I drink a decent amount of coffee.

The final one was after a 3 week cut. I took that selfie and then immediately abandoned it cause I felt like shit.

I found every episode trimmed and comprehensive. Strongly recommend a subscription if you can afford one (around 1 takeout coffee per month...)

Quick side rant - a lot of influencers in the calisthenics community are pretty uninformed on even basic exercise science, especially regarding programming and how to treat research. I think we need people like Steven who bring experience combined with a strong evidence-based understanding of exercise science and physiotherapy to bodyweight fitness. 

I've contacted mods re this post, if anything needs changing I'm happy to do so.

jo80gy,bodyweightfitness,"Weight loss over 4 months (age 30 / 188 cm / 74,7 kg) - Pics and data!","Proud at my 4-month weight loss result: [https://imgur.com/a/wn9uQw3](https://imgur.com/a/wn9uQw3)

* Weight loss: 81,2 to 74,7 kg (- 6,5 kg)
* Age: 30
* Height: 188 cm
* Calisthenics: 3-4/week
* Cardio: 1-2/week

Why I did it? Increase relative strength for calisthenics and to look better.

Source data sheet (= everything I ate in the last 4 months, Dutch people will recognize the products haha): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ulJYDpk2gH5sneYKhncfnRBt-Dl0\_LUOPNDs3wMIk6s/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ulJYDpk2gH5sneYKhncfnRBt-Dl0_LUOPNDs3wMIk6s/edit?usp=sharing)

Some notes/tips:

* I use 7-day average kcal data to get way more flexible in what/when I eat. Master those compensation tactics! So you can eat shit food and drink alcohol whenever the occasion presents itself.
* I created a custom kcal sheet because I think it's more accurate than diet apps and and takes me less time to use (formatted for easy mobile use). The columns can collapse so I can see detailed daily kcal and macros if I want to.
* Besides skipping breakfast for coffee I did not do any fancy diet - I just ate what I like and made sure it was satiating and full of protein.
* I got in 3 weeks of below 2000 kcal a day (750-950 kcal deficit), those were tough but felt rewarding!

Calisthenics level:

* Cleaning up my muscle ups
* Progressing from bent arm stands to handstand push ups
* Holding 45 degree human flags

Strength progress was slow during weight loss so I can't wait to eat on/above maintenance again in the coming months and unlock those super strict muscle ups and handstand push ups!

*EDIT - adding workout routine details:*  


* In these 4 months I mainly went to an outdoor calisthenics park with friends in the evening. That's the best 'routine' I can recommend to anyone: combine working out with hanging out.
* I bring resistance bands, a weight belt, kettlebells, rings, and parallettes to the park.
* Warm up: I ALWAYS do the recommended routine warm up of this subreddit.
* Then I decide if I go pull, push, legs, core or a combination of those, depending on what I did earlier that week, the state of my body, time available, what my friends do, etc. I like to be flexible in this.
* I picked exercises I want to progress on on-the-go from this sheet and I keep track of progressions: [https://imgur.com/a/P18GhFZ](https://imgur.com/a/P18GhFZ)
* Muscle ups and handstand push ups were my main skill goals - I always start with training those. Followed by some weighted work using kettlebells, then bodyweight work, then finishing up with human flags and/or basic mobility work.
* For cardio I mainly did running: trying to get faster at 3.3km (1 round of Vondelpark in Amsterdam).
* I pickup up bouldering in september, doing that once every 1-2 weeks now.
* In the coming winter period I go to the gym but I will keep doing calisthenics - currently programming a new routine/exercises for solo morning sessions before work.",2020-11-04 23:57:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jo80gy/weight_loss_over_4_months_age_30_188_cm_747_kg/
jjdcsb,bodyweightfitness,At Home Fitness Transformation / 9 months / 27yo ~165 lbs. (Feb.) - 158 lbs (now)," Hey guys. My name's Aaron and I just wanted to share my fitness journey that's taken place over the last 9 months that we've all been locked in our houses (I'm in LA so I'm still very much inside).

Let me preface this post by saying that I'm very much still early on in my fitness journey. I'd say about 75% of what I do is body weight exercises or started as body weight but now with extra weight. I have tons still to learn and improve upon. I've never been to a gym barring 1 or 2 times going half as a joke in HS, but at the beginning of quarantine I was in a really bad place personally. Super depressed and drinking a ton after moving out to LA and having the first few people I thought were friends f me over and lie about all kinds of stuff (I'm in the music industry and that's a story in and of itself, but for another day). I was just down overall, and my girlfriend at the time kinda gave me an ultimatum of ""you gotta find something that drives you and your passionate about or I can't stick around"". It had nothing to do with my physique, I'm just a person that needs exceptional personal challenges to work towards in able to keep myself happy and sane. She recommended that I look into some 75 day hard challenge.

Essentially 75 days with

\-no alcohol only drinking water and coffee

\-no drugs

\-only eating lean meats, whole grains, and vegetables.

\-Work out twice a day for 45 min each (at least half of that outside)

\-at least 7 hrs of sleep

So I decided I was going to try that out, and started at the very beginning of Feb. At first I wanted to die lmao but after a week or so I started to fall in love with the training and decided that I was going to make myself look like a marvel superhero, and be in my best athletic shape of my life instead of just doing the challenge for challenge' sake.

Here's the progress from day 1 (Feb 1st) till now [https://imgur.com/a/Eu0KFpk](https://imgur.com/a/Eu0KFpk)

I ended up lasting 60 days adhering strictly to the rules of the challenge, but had a drink on the 61st night lol.

As far as my routine -

When I first started I was walking 3 miles a morning 7 days a week gradually incorporating more and more running as I was able to.

Then for my lifting I'd lift every day doing a full body routine I made up. I got a backpack and filled it with my heaviest belongings till it was around 25 lbs and used that as a free weight.

100 standard pushups

50 declined pushups

50 inclined pushups

3 sets of  tricep dips 25 reps each

3 sets of curls 10 reps each arm

100 sit ups

3 sets upright row 20 reps each

2 sets of under arm raises 20 reps each side

That was essentially what I did for the first month till I got bored, and learned more about weightlifting etc.

Since the start of things I've done a ton of research and learned a lot more about weightlifting, rest days, dieting, macros, etc and have applied what seems to work best for me without being too overly critical.

These days I'm still eating super clean. Very little sugar. almost only whole grains, but limited carbs. I try to get 150 - 200 grams of protein a day. I have a few drinks every now and then, and sometimes allow for a cheat day every blue moon, but honestly the hardest thing for me is to intake enough calories every day to stay at a surplus. I have protein shakes sometimes, but other than that I've never done any supplements and wouldn't know where to start.

There have been slip ups here and there throughout the journey. In June my father in PA passed away surprisingly from a heart attack at 56, and that led to a rough few months for my physical and mental health and a lot of time helping with family, but these days I'm dealing with it all as well as I can.

My current routine is significantly more organized than it was. I alternating between doing sprints for 3.5 miles and rucking with 50 lbs for the same distance every other day. My 9 month old Pitsky loves the running days as she joins me every day.

Then for my lifting I split up my week doing

Mon - full upper body

Tues - Chest and Shoulders

Wed - Legs

Thur - Arms and Back

Friday - Rest

Sat - Chest and Arms

Sun - Legs

I try to get in 100 pull ups every other day as well. I try to break each day into 5 or 6 different workouts. doing 3/4 sets of each.

I also brought back a bunch of old donut shaped weights from PA so I can more precisely measure my strength improvements and all that, but still put them in my backpack for rucking, pushups, and most other things haha.

Apologies for making such a long post, but I wanted to try and provide some details as to what I'm doing. I've still got a good ways until I'm proper Superman ripped, but I've learned so much, and am so much happier having done what I have up till now. I'd love to chat with anyone so If you've got any inquiries about more specific elements don't be afraid to drop a comment. More than anything else these 9 months have reinforced my belief that there's no better way to succeed at something than to just start. As long as you aren't afraid to be wrong, and have a desire to learn along the way you'll be straight. If I tried to learn everything I know now before I started I never would have started.",2020-10-28 00:11:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jjdcsb/at_home_fitness_transformation_9_months_27yo_165/
itb3x1,bodyweightfitness,2.5 year calisthenics transformation from nothing.,"https://www.reddit.com/user/Haaspac/comments/itaq0p/feb_18_to_today_sep_20/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Male 35 170lbs 2.5years of progress. Weighted and bodyweight calisthenics with maybe 5 months of basic barbell compounds. Diet for last 8 years has been ovo-lacto vegetarian. I dont track calories but i think my protein intake is close to 1g/lb.

Third picture (skinny me) could get maybe 3 chinups and 10 bad pushups. Im almost 35, vegetarian, my training has consisted of probably 90% calisthenics and 10% barbell. I just got a trapbar for doing deadlifts rows and farmers at home now, so we'll see how that goes.

Edit: my training philosophy was train harder than last time (even long before I heard about coach greg), I focused on pushups and pullups and all the variations and ways to train those 2 movements for a loooong time when i started and still do. I got mentally tough from doing an absurd number of reps. I added in direct arm work in the last year or so after researching all the different stuff I could do on my rings and watching fitnessfaqs and calisthenicsmovement on youtube. Everyone says beginners shouldnt train to failure but I did, a lot. I did some basic compound barbell work for 5ish months at the local gym until they were shutdown from covid. I got up to 225bench for 5x5, 345trapbar deadlift for 5x5, and squatted 295 for 4x6 were my last training numbers in feburary of this year. I just got a trapbar and plates for my garage so ill be doing deadlifts once/twice a week in addition to all my calisthenics stuff so i dont neglect my ass and legs entirely. I was never a fan of pistol squats even though i did them begrudgingly.

Edit 2: most people seem way too concerned with how i trained, and no one cares about how I ate. Eating right and sleeping 7-9 hours is way more important than how many reps i did. For example i have eaten pizza MAYBE 3 times this whole year. I dont drink any alcohol either. My dad loves to offer me donuts at work and i always tell him no. Eat your fruits and vegetables people. Stop eating food with a laundry list of ingredients you cant pronounce. Do you want gainz or a 500 calorie treat for your mouth? Liquid is water, black coffee, and soymilk, thats it. 80 calories a day come from liquid, and i only know that because i just opened the fridge and looked. You cant get fat eating broccoli and spinach my dudes.

Edit 3: lots of people seem way too concerned about what my sets reps and rest breaks were, trying to get as nitty gritty as you can. How about i explain it this way. People in this thread said my chest was lacking. Thats fine, and probably a fair point, so on my day off today im playing some destiny this morning drinking coffee before i go take my dogs for a long walk. In between pvp matches or flying between planets im doing slow eccentric with a pause at the top and bottom diamond pushups, making sure my lats are flexed and scapula are depressed making my chest do all the work. Each rep is about 4 seconds. Every set was taken to complete collapsing on the ground body shaking grunting failure. The first set i did 28 reps which took about 1.5 minutes of time under tension, and now im somewhere around 15 sets in and im only able to do about 8-10 reps. Thats 15 hard as shit sets to failure. My chest is going to be in agony tomorrow, but should be ok to do dips on friday at the same tempo for lots more sets, then ive got saturday sunday and monday for my chest shoulders and triceps to recover from that huge volume. I hope this explains my work ethic better. Have you done 15+ sets to failure in a row?",2020-09-15 15:33:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/itb3x1/25_year_calisthenics_transformation_from_nothing/
hun7vw,bodyweightfitness,4 months Recommended Routine update (not quite happy),"I turned 27 few weeks ago, 5'9--138lbs, 179cm--62.7kg

[Only After, but I didn't change much anyway](https://ibb.co/wwF9jLB)



**Background**


I used to work as a bike courier for the last four years until last October (when I had an accident and decided to quit), so I used to do a lot of bike riding (about 150-300km / 90-190miles per week) and a bit of bodyweight training at home, but just a 20 min full body workout, so nothing intense.

Before I started the RR I bought a weighing scale and as it turns out nothing really changed (Always around 62,8kg/138lbs). Weight and bodyfat stayed almost the same. The scale shows me at about 9% bodyfat, but look at my progress picture and tell me, if thats possible? It looks and feels more like 15 maybe, is the scale wrong? It also shows muscle mass, which also stayed the same.

Anyway, I've been doing the RR for 4 months now, with a workout missing here and there, but trying to maintain consistence as much as possible, I walk a lot, also my job as a painter now requires me to move around (so I don't sit at a desk all day). I play tennis or basketball sometimes (like 3-4 times a month and planning to do more with a friend) and also like to go out to dance and party a bit (although not much recently because of corona) but overall I live an active lifestyle I would say.



**Routine**



3 sets Pull Ups on a door with 10,9,8 reps

8x3 Shrimp Squats

8x3 Pseudo Planche Push Ups (I can't do dips at home)

8x3 Nordic Curls

10x3 Horizontal Rows

8x3 Diamond Push Ups (with putting my feet on a higher position to make it harder)

60sec x3 Plank

12x3 pike compression

30sec x1 Banded Pallof Press

30sec x2 Copenhagen Plank with movement

12x3 Reverse Hyperextension



As I said before I like to play tennis or basketball on my rest days and also stretch as often as possible.



**Diet**



This is my biggest weakness. I eat whatever I want all the time. I did count calories for one month but then stopped again, because its too time consuming, but I do not eat the worst things--I just don't keep track of anything and treat myself to goodies. But it usually looks like this:

Wake up: Coffee/ Oats with chia seeds, raisins and frozen blueberries (I dont use milk, just water) **or** Tofu scramble with onions, garlic and tomatoes

Post workout: Protein Shake (with vegan protein powder, frozen strawberries, a banana and water)

Snack-Fruit (like watermelon, mangos or just an apple)

Lunch- Sandwich or I cook whole grain pasta with lentil bolognese, or curries with lentils and vegetables (all vegan)

Dinner- The same as for lunch and I also like to make a big salad with fresh tomatoes, paprika and a bit of hemp protein.

Usually asleep by 2:00am and awake by 10:00am, and dont like to nap during the day.

**Questions**

1. I dont look like I'm working out, my shoulders got a bit developed but overall I even got a bit more belly fat and love handles, although without gaining weight and since I'm already not weighing much I must be doing something wrong. Pls tell me what. I want to hear criticism at this point. At my height with working out I should be gaining weight, but when I'm eating more I just gain belly fat, Its annoying.

2. Is my scale showing my body fat at 9% wrong? It cant be correct. In December I was using a scale of a friend of mine that displayed 10,7% body fat. Its weird, I don't look like it.



**Conclusion**

To conclude I wanna mention the positive sides of doing the Recommended Routine. Its actually fun doing the workout and although my looks didn't change much so far, I feel much stronger and my back is so much healthier (had problems with that are for all my life) than ever before. Like my upper body just feels so stable, I love it

I'm now able to do 10 clean Pull Ups without using any kind of momentum or other help and it feels great.
Also doing rows really changed my perception of how often we use pull motions in day to day life that were more difficult before. This may sound weird, but its actually true. Even opening big heavy doors feels different now lol.

Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR: Love the recommended routine, but in 4 months my looks have rather gone worse than better, what do I need to change?!**",2020-07-20 15:26:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hun7vw/4_months_recommended_routine_update_not_quite/
hufvf1,bodyweightfitness,Keep a safe distance between you and other things when learning how to handstand (TIFU),"Well this is pretty obvious and I feel stupid but I still feel I need to say this.

Let me preface this by saying that I am a not a complete noob at handstands, I have been doing them for a long time (\~1-2 years on and off ) now mostly with wall support. Can get around 10seconds freestanding hold on a good day. I know how to bail out of one.

Today morning I thought I would do a skill session, did a couple of rounds of wall handstands and then usually I do some free standing ones to practice my kip ups. I did a couple but was kinda tentative and couldnt get my hips up high enough. Now around my third try, I put some extra effort into my kip and got my hip up high, held it for a second, and started falling over. No biggie this is when I bail out by piroutteing. For some weird reason I didnt, held on a bit longer and was gonna slam backwards into the ground. This would also be sort of fine as I folded my legs to break the fall. What I didnt factor in to all this was the coffee table. My shin slammed into it and the edge of the table broke off. It hurt like hell but I thought I must have grazed it and nothing major must have happened. When I pulled my pants up, I could literally see bone. My skin split open around my shin. (Couldnt get any pictures sadly). Led to 7 stitches on my shin, and rest for 12 days.

Dont be like me. Be smart. Recon your handstand zone and remove things that might cause stuff like this.

TL;DR: Did a handstand near a coffee table. Got 7 stitches on my shin.

PS: Now that I cant do any thing that involves lower body for around 12 days what would be some fun things that I could do just to target the upper body, core etc. My L-sit max hold is 30sec. I have rings and a bar too.",2020-07-20 05:44:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hufvf1/keep_a_safe_distance_between_you_and_other_things/

6x3 Deep step ups

6x3 Ring Dips

7x3 Harop Curls

I have also been mountain biking, running, and hiking on exercise days or as an active rest day.



**Diet**



This is my biggest weakness. I eat whatever I want all the time. I do not count calories, but I do not eat the worst things--I just don't keep track of anything and treat myself to goodies. But it usually looks like this:

Wake up: Coffee/Cream of Wheat

Post workout: Protein Shake

Snack-Fruit

Lunch- Sandwich or eggs and toast

Dinner- Burger or Burrito

Usually asleep by 10:00pm and awake by 6:00am, and sometimes I am able to squeeze a nap in during the day.

**Questions**

1. When should I try a muscle-up or work on one? I feel I may have the strength, but I feel weird about doing it when I am tired/on a rest day/before a workout.

2. What would you estimate my body fat%? I was thinking about 18%.

3. Is it possible to do too much cardio and that would prevent gains?


**Conclusion**

I love the Recommended Routine, and I have fun doing it. I am about to turn 30 and I am in the best shape of my life.



**TL;DR: Love the recommended routine!**",2020-07-17 22:17:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ht5725/3_month_progress_recommended_routine/
hlvzem,bodyweightfitness,6 weeks RR with intermittent fasting - help with hitting calorie surplus,"Hi All,
     I am early 40s male 160lb, 5'9"" and have been doing RR for 6 weeks (3 times a week) now and have gained considerable strength - from no pullup to 5 pullups, 5 dips and 10 pushups. Have been doing 16-8 intermittent fasting (with some 48 hour fasts thrown in every quarter or so). I am trying to hit a 20/20/60 (Carbs, Proteins, Fat) ratio since a while which gives me around 120gm of protein if I consume 2400 calories. My goal is to gain strength and I am not to bothered if I gain/loose 5lb here or there.

    Early 40s Male 160lb, 5'9""
    BMR = 1,621 Kcal/day
    TDEE with 4/5 days exercise = 2375 Kcal/day
    10% Surplus = 2612 Kcal/day 

Some comments followed by questions:

1. I am finding it hard to go all the way upto 2400 calories, and mostly peak around 2000 calories (can still get 100gm protein on 2000 calories) - especially when I include Whey protein powder I get too bloated to eat/snack MORE within my 8 hours window. 

2. My pull-ups and pushups are progressing well, and I don't feel that it is a lack of energy that is preventing more repetitions but basically lack of strength/volume in the muscles.

3. How can I judge if my protein (and calories) intake is enough - 

	a) Progression difficulty, visible muscle gain, how I feel after/during workout?

	b) Do I really need to go all the way up-to 2400-2600 range, if I am seeing all of the above from ""a"".

	c) Is 100gm of protein enough for muscle recovery? I can't overdo much with meat as I have a history of gout.

4. Generally workout in fasted state in the morning/mid-morning before my first meal but after a coffee. I progress well, but my arms are tired by the end of it and I can barely finish the abs wheel rollout. Again I sense it is not the lack of nutrition but rather muscle recovery and strength. Should I experiement with workout after a small breakfast?

Please share an experiences of doing RR while intermittent fasting. 

Thank you.

dsl6v6,bodyweightfitness,Tips on Increasing Reps for Weighted Chin Ups?,"I’ve steadily been increasing my weighted chin ups over the last 5 weeks, but my progress is starting to stall. I was wondering if anyone had any advice.

To increase my strength, my goal has been to do 3 sets of 5 reps with a rest of 2 minutes, adding 5 more pounds at the start of every week. I do this workout 3 times a week as part of a routine that’s pretty similar to the RR, and I do my chin ups first since it’s the exercise I want to advance the most in. At every weight I’ve attempted so far, I’ve consistently been able to do 5 reps on the first set, 4 to 5 on the second set, and usually 4 to 3 on the third set. To make up for the lost reps on my last set, I’ll immediately strip all the weight, and do regular chin ups to failure (the first two weeks I could only do about 2 or 3 more, but now I’m up to about 4 to 6).

This has been working really well for me up until now. I went from only being able to do 20 pounds my first week, to hitting the same numbers with 40 pounds with 6 extra bodyweight chins ups at the end. This has all been with very strict form (no kicking or momentum cheating, hang with engaged shoulders at the bottom, and with my chin to or over the bar each time). However, this week, I’ve been struggling to move up to 45 pounds. On Monday, I could only do 3 reps on the first set, 2 on the second, and 2 on the last set followed by a superset of 6 extra bodyweight chin ups.

In your experience, what is the best way to overcome a plateau like this?

I figured it might be best to go back to basics. When you’re first learning to do chin ups, you do negatives – so today I did 3 reps with 45 pounds, followed by 2 negatives with the belt still on, then 2 reps and 3 negatives, then 1 rep, 4 negatives, and 2 bodyweight chin ups to finish. I also did 5 bodyweight chin ups as a warm up, instead of jumping right into it like I have in the past, and I added a bowl of oatmeal to my regular breakfast to give myself some extra calories to burn. Even so, I’m not sure if negatives are as effective as alternatives such as dropping the weight and aiming for higher reps/more sets, adding in some curls afterwards, doing some forearm strength work, etc. Any guidance would be appreciated.

Some other stuff about me that might be relevant – I’m male, in my early 20s, 6 foot, and weigh about 175 pounds. I sleep 7 to 8 hours each night. About an hour before I do the workout, I have 3 eggs, 2 pieces of turkey bacon, a fruit smoothie, and I drink about 20 oz of water (sometimes add a coffee if I didn’t sleep well). When I’m done working out, I always have a protein shake. The rest of the day, I keep my diet as strict as I can, making sure to eat plenty of good stuff like chicken, salmon, pork, steak, mixed vegetables, and cauliflower rice. I haven’t calculated it recently, but I would estimate I come in at about 2000-2500 calories a day, getting at least 180 grams of protein. I also run about 3 miles 3 days a week between a 7 to 8 minute pace, and box for an hour to two hours 5 days a week. Both of those workouts always come after any weighted calisthenic work so I'm not too tired to push weight.",2019-11-06 19:24:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dsl6v6/tips_on_increasing_reps_for_weighted_chin_ups/
dsbiq9,bodyweightfitness,"Which factors have the most significant impact on making real progress (exercise selection, nutrition, sleep & recovery, supplements)?","I’ve been through a few mesocycle training blocks this year, and recently I’ve been reflecting on what factors made a substantial difference to my progress.
I realize this is very subjective, and I’m not a doctor or certified trainer, so I would be curious to hear from others on your thoughts and ideas and what you think.

 ^^^^^.

Weight % | Area | Comments / Lessons Learned
---|---|----
40% | **Programming & Exercise Selection** | Have a plan and make sure you follow it – i.e. consistency.  The frequency of workouts, [high yield] exercise selection, # of sets and reps per workout, and total weekly volume, tempo, etc. all contribute to the results and will make a difference.  Have a plan and stick to it.  Don’t change things up every other week or change exercises regularly.  Give yourself enough time to adapt, get results, and finally make real progress.  I try to keep the same exercises during an entire mesocycle but have made some substitutions too.
25% | **Nutrition/nutrition timing** | What you eat and when you eat it matters.  Certainly calories are calories but getting them from real, natural foods which tend to be *high quality* sources of sustenance rather than *low quality* processed or refined food is better for the body in my humble opinion.  The majority of my diet is from eggs, nuts and seeds, vegetables (a lot), fruit, chicken, fish, and seafood.  I drink mostly water as my beverage of choice, except for a little black coffee in the morning.  I also enjoy wine with a nice meal on special occasions.  I’ve learned a lot about nutrition and nutrition timing and how macros matter e.g. having adequate protein and fat together in one meal is key.  
25% | **(1) Sleep & (2) Recovery** | (1) Getting 8 hours or more of sleep is very beneficial to me, even though it is a luxury.  This was key during my two Mass Gain mesocycles this summer, but I am now back to <8 hours per night.  (2) Having the discipline to allow for adequate muscle recovery between working sets and to prevent overuse injuries or excess muscle damage (!) has been a learning process.  My personality or perhaps ego to push myself harder has led to sub-optimal training in the past.  I’m learning and improving.  I no longer do sets until technical failure – I aim to have 1-2 reps in reserve most of the time, but there can be some exceptions to this *rule*.  I would sometimes struggle with having adequate rest between workouts whether it is DOMS or simply allowing for proper muscle recovery.  For example, when I do 60 weighted pull-ups +60lbs/27kg I do not push myself to repeat that exercise less than 48 hours later to see if I am “tough enough.”  I wait 2 days since I know my lats and back need time for muscle recovery.  The same would be true previously when doing 160-200 pull-ups in a high-volume workout, I would rest 2-3 days so my arms and lats to fully recover.  That allows me to work on other muscle groups, mobility, and skills.    
10% | **Supplements** | [I am not talking about steroids, illegal substances, or performance-enhancing drugs].   Examples:  protein, creatine, vitamins, etc.  I believe I now better understand the proper dosages and timing for protein and creatine.  I also take supplements such as fish oil, magnesium citrate, vitamin D3, and a daily multi-vitamin for general wellness at my age (48).  

# Summary
I put programming and exercise selection at the top of my list since it accounts for almost half of the priority or contribution.  Then I score",2019-11-06 05:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dsbiq9/which_factors_have_the_most_significant_impact_on/
d0mq8s,bodyweightfitness,"Years exercising, little result. What am I doing wrong?","I'm a 48 year-old male, 5'9"", 155 lbs.

I have basically been exercising for the last 20+ years with little to show for it. Sure, if I look at pictures from 15 years past and now I see that my upper body developed a bit, but I've also seen people get the same results after six months at the gym.

I have done martial arts (Tae Kwon Do, Ninjutsu, Aikido) in my teens/late 20s/early 30s, so I know it allows for the development of fast muscle fibers but not volume. After that I lifted weights for some time, but after my previous training where every class is different, doing the same thing every day bored me fast. I endured the training, but I was bored to death with weightlifting.

After a few hand and shoulder injuries resulting from the weight I was handling, and longing for more variety, I started to look into bodyweight exercises. I found the YAYOG app, which provides a nice progression. I did that for a year or two. Later I found the TouchFit GSP app for iPhone, which is more like HIIT/martial arts training, and I stuck with it for a few years, alternating my exercise days between the two.

Then I heard about Convict Conditioning and did that for a while but had to abandon it due to some lower back issues (assuming they came from all the bridges I had to do, which were a little painful). In that time, I noticed my shoulders started developing more than ever. I went back to TouchFit for a while until I recovered, and then found here a reference to Stew Smith's SEAL training. I did that for a few months where I mastered doing hundreds of pushups/squats, etc. but it consists of always doing the same exercises so I got tired of it after about six months. I also kept doing TouchFit on my 'off' days. TouchFit helped me achieve (probably) the best aerobic training level I had in my life as far as performance, but after a few years using it I didn't see any growth in the mirror. I was toned, for sure, but still skinny. I was about 155 lbs. at the time, 15.7% body fat.

I saw references here to ""Get Strong"" by the Kavadlo brothers. Reading more, I realized that maybe I had been doing the wrong kind of exercises for muscle growth, so I started to follow the program from the start, which felt like a vacation considering I was doing hundreds of pushups a day. I looked for information on dieting and 'if you want to grow, you have to eat more' stuck with me, so I did that. My weight went up to 159, but also gained 3% body fat. I tried to dial down the carbs to bring the fat % down, but as of this morning I'm back to 155 lbs, 19.2% bf. Muscle mass seems to have plunged by 2 pounds. What the hell.

Lately I was alternating between Get Strong and TouchFit on my off days (I do 20 minutes instead of 40 as I was doing before). I had to restart Get Strong because of a tendon issue from hanging down from a bar, but as I needed to dial down the amount of reps I did vs. SEAL training I feel I lost some muscle mass. I don't feel as strong as I was before.

So I'm still considering to keep on the Get Strong program because I know it will get more intense in the long term, but alternate it with other things. In fact, I'm thinking of doing one day from each program I've done each day of the week. That at least should prevent it from becoming routine. Something like:

Monday: SEAL training (to start fresh after the weekend and punish myself :)Tuesday: YAYOGWednesday: TouchFitThursday: Running/Cycling(?)Friday: Convict Conditioning

I will be pushing myself with this program, but I have also read that you need to give your body a break in order to avoid injury, so it's hard for me to find the point of balance between ""I'm training hard, maybe too hard"" (and injure myself) and ""I'm not doing much and going nowhere"".

My goal is to achieve muscle growth, but also the ability to maintain physical fitness.

I know I'm leaving stuff out, but I try to eat healthy. Fruits, no fried stuff, whole grain bread (not everyday), vegetables, lean cuts. A typical weekday is:

\-Pre workout: Fruit, 1tbsp peanut butter-Post workout: Coffee, fruit, 1 scoop protein powder.-Lunch: 6-8 oz meat, salad, 1/2 cup rice.-Snacks: Fruit, handful of almonds, 1 scoop protein powder.-Dinner: 6 oz meat, salad.

I may indulge in a burger with fries occasionally, but not every weekend.

Any ideas/recommendations?

Thanks!

Note: I did try to educate myself on nutrition, the different kinds of training and how the body works, but maybe I haven't found the right answers.",2019-09-06 21:15:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/d0mq8s/years_exercising_little_result_what_am_i_doing/
cq0knw,bodyweightfitness,"24/M/5'11"" 1 Year, 4 Months Progress from Calisthenics/Gymnastics","Hi everyone! I posted a year and a bit ago on r/Fitness detailing the first year of my transformation.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/85qzw4/22m511\_1\_year\_journey\_from\_162\_lbs\_to\_151\_lbs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/85qzw4/22m511_1_year_journey_from_162_lbs_to_151_lbs/)

A few days after posting that I discovered calisthenics and body-weight exercises and it completely changed my life. I used to lift weights 5-6 days a week and also did Judo/Muay Thai at the same time, but since moving home for the summer I switched into gymnastics in order to help me progress in my calisthenics and general flexibility, and man is it tough! I obviously still have a very long way to go before I can even say that I'm mediocre at many of the skills, but I am very happy with the progress I have made so far, and it's been inspiring seeing so many posts here and on r/Fitness showing people's progress. I work out a lot because it's sort of become my passion and my main hobby, and it honestly changed my whole life so I'm just hoping to help someone else out who's just starting or inspire someone like others did for me at the beginning.

I'm happy to answer any questions or take any criticisms you might have about how bad my squat and deadlift are (I didn't start training back/legs until late in the game...)!

*(bonus) Before Calisthenics:* *April 2018* – [https://imgur.com/a/1obbwOu](https://imgur.com/a/1obbwOu)

One of the main things I noticed after over a year of body-weight training is that my body-weight dropped significantly. If you’ll notice from the April 2018 picture, before starting calisthenics, my body fat % was still way over 10%. I’m not sure how low it is now, but if I had to guess I would say it’s around 8% (feel free to correct me if you think otherwise!).

&#x200B;

**Here is a list of some of the skills I have progressed in over the past year and 4 months (anything listed as weighted is a one-rep max):**

Push-Ups 30 > 70 -  Weighted Push-Ups 20lbs > 90lbs

Pull-Ups 5 > 20  -  Weighted Pull-Ups 15lbs > 95lbs

Dips 10 > 35 -  Weighted Dips 45lbs > 135lbs

Pistol Squats 0 > 15/side

&#x200B;

**Sunday – Core & Gymnastics**

· Same as Tuesday/Thursday.

&#x200B;

Right now I have gymnastics on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays for about 3.5 hours a night, meaning I can only train weights three days a week. Until September I've changed my shoulder day to be a part of my chest/triceps day.

My workouts changed significantly, as I shifted from just doing weights every day to doing mostly weighted calisthenics. I saw a lot of videos online of people doing these crazy moves on the bar with their body and decided I wanted to try it out.

My diet also changed significantly as I started to cut out all of the fast food, junk food, sugar, and unnecessary carbohydrates. I stopped drinking for the most part, which has also helped a lot, because not only am I never ""too hungover to workout"", I don't have those empty calories holding me back. Since giving up alcohol and fast food/junk food, I’ve noticed dramatic increases in my workout progress and my wallet hates me less.

**Here is what my diet mainly consists of:**

*Protein -* Chicken, eggs, fish, steak, duck, Greek yogurt

*Carbs -* Quinoa, fruit (berries, avocado, dates, figs mostly), vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, sweet potato, green beans, SPINACH)

I cut out most dairy products and white foods like pasta/bread/potato stuff because I found it just made me bloated and sluggish. I don’t drink coffee or tea, only water because I prefer it. I get a lot of questions to why I don’t have any peanut butter or nuts in my diet – I’m allergic. :(

arkgv0,bodyweightfitness,Are These Strength Hacks Legit?,"I’ve heard a lot of different advice about gaining strength. Sometimes it was even contradictory. So I made a list of the most relevant tips. Let me know which ones which ones are BS and which ones are gold based on your own experience:

1. Don’t train to failure, leave at least one or two reps in the bank
2. Use deloads to let the body recover and come back stronger
3. Use as much frequency as your CNS and connective tissue can handle (aim for 3 times a week but you can do more if you use less intensity like when greasing the groove)
4. Don’t focus too much on Isometrics as you’ll only get stronger in that particular position rather than on the whole range of motion
5. Focus mostly on concentrics as they will make you stronger without destroying your muscles (longer recovery) with eccentrics \[*here’s where I personally find most debate*\]
6. Use eccentrics (negatives) first when learning a new bodyweight skill because you’ll be stronger than in concentrics (positives)
7. When you reach a decent level where linear progressions don’t work, go for undulated progressions
8. Stay on the lower rep range, between 1 to 5 reps, but complete at least 10 reps per exercise per workout
9. Focus also on building muscle as strength has both a neurological component and a muscular one
10. Rest as much as needed in between sets
11. Use power breathing (slow and deep breaths) while resting to increase your strength on the next set
12. Fix your weak links. You most likely will have a muscle on the chain that’s limiting your total force output
13. Increase your testosterone (nutrition, reducing cortisol, …)
14. Have a strong core, as the movement of your extremities comes from there
15. Have structural integrity on your joints to make them naturally more stable so that they are also a better base for creating strength
16. Increasing your grip strength will automatically make you stronger on the bars / parallettes
17. Drinking coffee before training can increase your strength
18. Train between 16:00 to 18:00 for maximum strength",2019-02-17 13:17:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/arkgv0/are_these_strength_hacks_legit/

What a new idea: lose weight while concentrating yourself! After all, ""weight loss starts in your brain.

Three selected reviews for these programs so far:

Red tea Detox:

I was happy and surprised with this product. I am a heavy coffee drinker and have only tried hot tea a few times / rarely. The first cup of this tea, (prepared as recommended), was a very pleasant surprise! The color, the aroma, the softness, was enough difference that I carried a cup and a couple of tea bags around the community. Everyone who tasted it immediately said: ""I can / will drink that"". The natural lack of caffeine moves it to a fun evening cup!

I did not have much to lose, probably about 10 pounds. But that does not mean that it is not just stubborn or frustrating to leave. I already have a reasonably healthy diet. I have tried to change that, to exercise more / differently, I drink all my required water. I could not see what else I could do that would make me lose the last 10 pounds. Eating healthy, going to the gym 5 days a week, I got so frustrated.

Haylie Pomroy's 5-Day Red-Carpet-Ready Cleanse Program:

My mother-in-law is currently working on Haylie's Fast Metabolism Diet plan, so I started researching her products and came across this 5-day cleaning. I read the '5 lbs in 5 days' and thought I would lose 2 or 3 lbs. I LOSE 6 POUNDS IN 5 DAYS. I am so happy. I've been trying to reduce this weight for months. The package came with a recipe book that told you what to eat and how much to eat. It was so easy. I decided to cook all my meals on the Sunday before the start and it took about 2 hours. Then I would just look at the book, see what I had to eat that day and how many shakes I needed and it was a breeze. I will definitely try this 5-day Cleanse again. If you have the last few stubborn pounds to lose or if you are ready to change a healthier lifestyle, I recommend this cleaning program completely.

I'm now 22 and my elbow is still shattered into a million pieces. Elbows don't heal, the only fix is surgery to remove the pieces( and possibly install artificial pieces). I haven't gotten the surgery yet because it rarely affects my daily life. Sometimes my arm will lock up half bent when I'm serving coffee at work, but  i just bring it back to my chest and it's all good again. Eventually I plan on getting surgery, but that'll probably be after I finish my masters so I still have a couple years.

&#x200B;

I've also sustained 4 collar bone breaks(2 on each side). Those don't affect me too much anymore either, so no worries there. However, those breaks happened in pretty rapid succession over 2 years and I lost A LOT of my upper body strength. When I do push ups, my elbow clicks and pops. It doesn't hurt, but it is kind of uncomfortable. It just makes me sort of squeamish and not want to continue.  When I had a gym membership, chest press, lifting, etc didn't affect my elbow. It only really  happens during pushups. So, I'm looking for some pushup alternatives to work my upper body a bit.

I'm no longer weak by any means, but a buddy wants a rematch in a friendly boxing match, so I've gotta bulk up a bit for when that time comes lol",2018-10-27 22:41:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9ryg1c/injured_need_suggestions_for_arm_workouts/
944eiq,bodyweightfitness,Buoyancy assisted muscle up and pike(?) planche in the pool. Also a brief progress report.,"Summer. Hot. Pool. Instead of laying in recliner with occasional dips in the pool I laid in recliner and [practiced L-sit, dips, muscle-ups and future planche](https://youtu.be/_9iuFaMz7z4). Also pistols (turns out I do not have to [lift my supporting ankle](https://youtu.be/12XOLF-SspU?t=1m40s), if I can lower my free leg while doing pistols) and climbing (this pool has climbing wall).  Among other achievements, this was the very first time I have done a jump-flip. Unreasonably proud of that. :-)

Since this video is an opportunity to show my current physique in shorts, a brief progress report.

M 56 5'10"" 190lbs.  

[This is me at 220lbs in November 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=222Bwy888hY). Had depressing summer, not working out and lots of carbs to get to this weight.

Diet. 

Sort of intermittent fasting: reduced meals to two per day, but no set interval between meals. Started to pay attention to portion size. Breakfast -- oats with milk, nuts and berries; tea/coffee. Dinner -- whatever I feel like with protein (eggs/fish/sausage/chops) and salad/whole grains side. Lost 30 pound in 6 months and stalled at 190lbs, probably because I had decided to experiment with creatine and whey protein. Both are finished now. I expect to start losing weight again soon. As far as muscle gain, they probably helped a bit. Hard to say since I also started more difficult workout routine at the time.

Workout.

[I have restarted 'You are your own gym' at beginner level in November 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=222Bwy888hY&list=PL71cpS872GXn5kS9nRf0d0rI51Mbs-1Gg&index=3) (have been cycling through this routine at intermediate level for a few years before summer 2017). Finished all four levels, including [Chief for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06of-XDmJ8s&list=PL71cpS872GXm9Gh7Hb5x9J3_rmjkwx2eq) (creatine might have helped here). Now doing Chief again with better form and substituting some exercises to target my upper chest, lats, overall back, and hams more. 

Motivation.

Health. Mirror. Shooting workout videos also helped to be consistent.

8z2b2j,bodyweightfitness,Any thoughts and recommendations on deload weeks combined with fasting?,"Dear BWFers,
I have a question about deload weeks and fasting combined.

An intermediate BWFer here. Been doing the RR for two years now. Lately increased both frequency and volume, and added straight arm work to my routine. This put some noticeable stress onto my joints, mainly my elbows and wrists. So I decided to have a deload week starting this Friday.


I usually have 400 gr meat everyday, and if I can't get that, I supplement my protein intake goal (120 gr a day) with some whey protein.


So my question is, would it be advised to have a 3-4 days of fasting (water, tea and coffee allowed, just no calories) to go with the deload week? I will be doing a very low intensity workout (lots of walking, some yoga asana practice and maybe some light band work) So I think it should be a good opportunity to fast for more than a few days. On the other hand, since my body needs nutritions to repair itself, maybe I need food more than when I do my regular workout. 


What do you guys think? Do you think a 3-4 day fasting is a good idea to go with the deload week?",2018-07-15 15:03:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8z2b2j/any_thoughts_and_recommendations_on_deload_weeks/
8m5dw4,bodyweightfitness,Need advice with supplements,"Hey guys,

I'm wondering if I should be using any kind of supplements. Hope you can give me your opinion based on my lifestyle.

I'm going boxing three times per week. It's a group program and it's pretty intense(1hr with small breaks). I feel really tired after every training. The program consists of 3 parts: 1. warmup(e.g. jumping jacks), 2.boxing, 3. HIIT/strength workouts (almost no pause between). I feel a lot better after doing this constantly for 2months+ and I've lost a bit of my body fat. However, I feel like better diet (or using supplements) would boost my results.

I've been skinny fat for all my life and I have those awful 'love handles'. The goal is, of course, to lose my belly fat(and love handles) and gain muscles. I'm 22 male, 80kg and 185cm.

I'm not counting my calories but I feel like I don't eat too much. I'm focused on eating healthy and avoid sodas and sugary food. Usually I have one cheat meal per week ( I just love burgers, can't help it haha). Also, I try not to eat late night (only air popped popcorns from time to time when watching a movie).

Regarding energy, I'm usually giving my best (at least I think I am haha) at every workout so I think I don't need any energy boosters. Coffee does the job for me if I feel tired.

So my question is would using any sort of supplements help me reach my goals faster? Should I be using whey protein, creatine, casein, omega 3s etc.? Sorry I'm new to this, so don't want to cause any side effects from this.

For now, I'm mostly focused on eating food/snacks rich in protein after workout (protein bars, tuna, eggs, banana etc.).

Any suggestion is welcome. If you have any tips that would speed up my results, please share.

Thanks in advance!

7swkbj,bodyweightfitness,Theory Thursday – The Progressive Approach to Dieting,"I’m going to put this Theory Thursday in the frame of reference of dieting to lose weight. One can also be on a weight gaining diet, of course, but that’s an article for another day. I also use the term “diet” to refer to what a person habitually eats, rather than a temporary change, such as a crash or “cleanse” diet.

When it comes to diets, it seems most of us have the tendency to throw every single strategy, tweak, and trick into creating our diet plan. So what usually happens is that we end up with a heavily restricted diet by a litany of rules, that’s drastically different to what our previous consumption was. Not only is this a huge challenge to stick to, it also means that you’ve already used up all your ways to progress your diet, so when your weight loss plateaus, what will you do next?

A better way to approach your diet is to do the minimum needed to create a sustainable weight change, then to progressively add in strategies to maintain that weight change as your needs change. For most people, a sustainable amount of weight loss is about **0.25-.5kg per week**. Any more than this will often mean that a higher proportion of muscle mass is lost with the fat, which is usually not anyone’s aim.

#A Brief Note on How Diets Work

All weight-loss diets, whether a named diet such as “Paleo”, “Keto” or “Juice Detox”, or a diet plan of your own creation, work by reducing the total amount of calories you consume. They sometimes also encourage exercise and other movement to increase the amount of calories you expend. In the end, the caloric balance is in deficit.

Diets can accomplish this by: 

* Restricting the amount of food you eat, such as counting points, counting calories directly, or simply reducing portion size.
* Restricting the types of food you eat, such as no carbs (keto), no modern food (paleo), no food (juice cleanse), no junk. This is usually biased towards banning foods that are calorically dense and not filling.

Diets that tend to work well focus on the psychological side of dieting and how our physiology interplays with that psychology. Certain foods and strategies are more likely to keep you feeling fuller for longer, and avoid the feeling of hunger as much as possible. Often simple rules that ban certain foods can keep them out of your pantry, meaning you’re less likely to be tempted by foods that can quickly derail your diet.

#Dietary Strategies

Simply pick 1-3 strategies that work well together and apply them for at least a week. Evaluate the amount of weight loss you’re accomplishing from this strategy. If you aren’t at the rate of weight loss you’re aiming for (again, usually **0.25-0.5kg/week**), try incorporating another strategy.

Once you’ve reached the desired weight loss rate, simply focus on retaining those strategies until the weight loss starts to plateau again, then repeat the process above, incorporating new strategies.

This method accomplishes a few important things; firstly, it means that the diet isn’t a total shock, you’re making some small progressive changes, and it will be easier to maintain the changes for the long term if they aren’t massive and drastic. Secondly, like said above, it gives you room to adapt your diet when progress slows. Lastly, it allows you to build the skills of dieting. These come in handy not only during this weight loss bout, but also in future attempts as well. You will get better at utilising these strategies as you use them, making it easier to make the change you want.

#Mindfulness Strategies

**Logging Your Diet**

Yes, simply logging your food is a way of being mindful of your diet, and you’ll find that often this is enough to create some change in your diet, as we naturally affect our diet in response to it being observed and recorded. Tracking also gives you the information you require in order to make more powerful changes. You can simply use pen and paper and search for calorie information online, or use a handy mobile app like MyFitnessPal or FatSecret. 

I believe this to be the most pivotal strategies of them all, and a lot of people grimace at the idea of being so “neurotic” and “doing so much work”. However, I liken it to deciding to not track your workouts; it’s the difference from getting a bit of exercise and training to improve for the long term.

Tracking becomes easier and second-nature the longer you do it, and it not only builds the skill of tracking, but it helps you create a better awareness of what you’re putting into your body, learning the macros and calories of the types of foods you’ll usually eat, and that might surprise you.

**Slow Down Your Eating**

Eating slower can help creating a feeling of fullness. It allows you to eat less of the current meal or not have to go back to the kitchen immediately because the food hasn’t had time to make you feel full.

**Avoid Eating While Doing Other Activities**

Make eating food it’s own activity. Try to avoid eating food as something you do *while* doing other activities. It reduces how mindful you can be about what you’re eating and decreases the feeling of fullness you get from meals. If you’re eating something delicious, I’d also argue you get loss enjoyment out of the item you’re eating.

Too often we consume food while we’re distracted by TV, easily leading to over-consumption. Sitting down at the table to eat creates a ritual to help become more mindful while eating. One of my big dietary setbacks was eating in the car while driving, which never really satisfied me.

**Stop Eating When Satisfied**

This is the culmination of all the mindfulness strategies, the ability to listen to your body, and be able to enjoy your food without the feeling of being uncomfortably full. I know this is hard for a lot of people due to their upbringing and a culture of not wasting food, but simply not finishing food you’ve served yourself because you’ve had enough is a very powerful strategy.

Personally, one of my biggest dieting breakthroughs was when I went a bit off the rails with my diet and had purchased some fish and chips, which of course comes with a mountain of hot chips as a minimum. I had eaten my fish and a few chips, when I realised I was quite satisfied. I had had my delicious cheat, I had a satisfying amount of food. If I continued to eat, I would have only felt nauseatingly full, and have gained extra calories (something I was certainly not short of). I realised I was losing nothing of value when I threw away the remainder of my uneaten chips.

#Addition, Subtraction and Substitution Strategies

**Drink Water**

Set an amount of water for yourself to drink each day. Start with a good drink in the morning when you wake up, this will not only affect your feeling of fullness, but also increase your alertness and help you feel less drowsy. It might help you rely less of coffee in the morning.

Drinking throughout the day also has the added benefit of making you feel well and being good for your health. Including good poops!

**Eat Vegetables**

Before you even consider trying to cut out foods, I recommend adding in some food first. Vegetables are generally calorically sparse, and nutrient dense, meaning that they’re filling and good for you. We all know we should probably eat more veggies, but if you challenge yourself to eat a very decent serve of vegetables each day, and change nothing else, I’d wager you’ll naturally cut out some more calorically dense foods, simply from feeling fuller.

Try to focus on leafy vegetables and cruciferous vegetables, as trying to get large serves of starchy vegetables like potatoes, or sweet vegetables like carrots and tomatoes isn’t as calorically sparse. Though they’re still good for you.

**Reduce or Remove Sweet Drinks**

This is one of the more powerful junk “foods” to dispose of. Soft drinks are one of the most calorically dense foods, least filling, and come in massive servings that are easy to consume quickly. Since they’re also not very filling, removing them doesn’t affect your hunger too greatly.

Replace the drinks with water or sparkling water if possible. Drinking diet soft drinks probably isn’t the absolute greatest thing for your health, but the potential caloric restriction from having diet soft drinks likely outweighs this negative by a great margin.

#Portioning Strategies

**Measure What You Eat**

Absolutely necessary if you want to track what you eat effectively of course, but weighing alone can help you judge consistent servings of your food. A simple kitchen scale is cheap and easy to use. You don’t have to weigh absolutely everything for this strategy to work, and sometimes it’s simply impossible to, but the more information the better.

**Use Smaller Crockery**

Using smaller plates and bowls is a simple way to help you portion out less food onto your plate, and can also make you feel fuller after eating. If you want to eat more than a small plate or bowl can carry, it also means that you need to make the conscious decision to go and get a second serve. This allows an opportunity for you to judge your fullness and satisfaction before deciding whether you want to eat more.

**Restrict Meal Timing**

Restricting yourself to a window of eating can help with managing your hunger levels throughout the day, and a lot of people will find they feel no worse not eating for a significant portion of the day. The time you choose to restrict yourself can be quite personal, and depend on what you’re eating, how much you’re eating, the physical demands of your day and even your personality, so no one size fits all. There’s no magic rules about not eating certain things after certain times, so pick a window that works for you.

For those that decide to delay breakfast, my biggest tip is to have a meal planned for the start of your eating window, to avoid binges from hunger. Also consider moving away from traditional breakfast foods and trying dinner like meals; having some protein and vegetables as your first meal is a good way to feel full and get a serve of vegetables in early.

#Conclusion

These are just some strategies to try out, obviously there are a lot more out there, and there’s the actually planning of meals and restricting of junk food, meal preparation, etc. The plan is all about working out what works for you, and adapting plans to suit you need.

A final important note about weight loss that I don’t think is said often enough: **it is okay, even normal, to feel hungry**, you don’t need to feel full constantly shouldn’t be the normal state, even when not trying to lose weight.

**Discussion Questions:**

* Do you have any experience with any of the above strategies? Good? Bad? Tips or tweaks?
* Do you have any strategies that you’re using that you feel others could benefit from?
* Any strategies that you’ve tried that simply sucked?
* Are you an all-out dieter, or a steady-progressive dieter?",2018-01-25 14:54:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7swkbj/theory_thursday_the_progressive_approach_to/
7pno3p,bodyweightfitness,Theory Thursday - Why you suck and how to use that to your advantage,"That time of year for habit formation and motivation posts.

#You get a rush from planning just how good you’ll be and how much progress you’ll make

You plan how you’ll start an exercise plan, how you’ll diet on Monday, how you’ll be *so good* when you have a perfect week. This sets off all sorts of lights in your brain that leads to a hormone cascade that feels so *great*. Unfortunately, this is often the rush we get addicted to, rather the rush of actual accomplishment. The rush of your imagined perfect week becomes satisfying enough that the effort of actually following through isn’t even necessary any more. You could become addicted to chasing that planning high and making the most elaborate plan ever, potentially leading you down the path of analysis paralysis.

This leads to a cycle of planning; feeling good; becoming complacent and inadequately following through; feeling disappointed in your effort and disillusioned with the process; convincing yourself that the either the plan wasn’t good enough (leading to more planning wankery) or that you just “need to try harder next time” and never getting anywhere.

**How do you turn this to your advantage?** 

Planning is good, it helps you organise your efforts. But preparing is better. Preparing is planning backed with action. You still get that rush from planning, but you actively engage yourself in the process, meaning you’re more likely to continue to with action. Preparing reduces the friction and inertia in actually starting.

Some key examples are:

* Don’t plan to go to the gym tomorrow. Prepare by laying out your gym clothes ready to go and putting the appointment in your calendar.
* Don’t plan on going to bed earlier to get more restful sleep. Prepare by putting a reminder to start your pre-bed ritual.
* Don’t plan to eat healthier. Print out the recipe and write out your grocery list.

Put these preparations in obvious, in-your-face places. Stick the prepared lists to your fridge, the clothes by your door or on your bedside table. Make sure you can’t trick yourself into missing your earlier efforts.

Obviously this tip doesn’t always work, but it’s a good thing to consider if you can.

#You have an All-or-Nothing approach.

“I’m going to go to the gym every day this week”. Then you miss your session on Thursday, so Friday, Saturday and Sunday are a write off.

Now this approach has some obvious drawbacks, but it’s hard to get out of this subconscious trap. The key advice here is to be more forgiving to yourself and set more flexible and realistic goals. That’s easier said than done.

**How do you turn this to your advantage?**

People who live by this philosophy I’ve found often hate breaking a winning streak, so once they’ve got going with a habit, they’ll find it harder and harder to drop it, which is great when that habit is exercise! 

So how do we get a habit in the first place if it’s so easy to drop it early with one early setback? Set gateway goals. Set goals that are so easy to complete, but you’ll often go ahead and do more anyway:

* Go to the gym for at least 5 minutes
* Put a bottle of water and a glass on your desk at work
* Write one sentence of your essay

These goals are so minuscule you’ll want to just knock them out of the park early, they’re so easy you’ll beat yourself up for breaking your streak by not just going to the gym for 5 minutes, they’re forgiving, because you really can go to the gym for 5 minutes and then leave if you’re not feeling it, and you’ll still have your streak. But the main point is, you’re likely to do most of what you want to accomplish once you’ve started, so make it your goal to just start!

Mark it on a calendar, count the number of days in a row, and don’t cheat!

#You take days off training because factor x means training won’t be **OPTIMAL**

We’re always looking for excuses to avoid hard shit. We’re convinced our time training isn’t worth shit if we aren’t in peak physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual condition. We’d rather take a day off and try to catch up, probably eventually deciding our catch up day wasn’t optimal either and forever fall behind.

**How do you turn this to your advantage?**

Your brain is so good at finding all the reasons something is hard, don’t try to fight it, turn into the wind. Let’s list all the ways something could mess up your training:

* You didn’t get enough sleep
* You slept in and now you’re rushed
* You haven’t had your coffee
* You’ve had too much coffee and you can’t focus
* You’re too hungry
* You ate too recently
* You’re too bloated
* You haven’t had enough carbs
* You haven’t had enough calories
* You haven’t had enough protein
* You’re still sore
* You’re feeling a bit clumsy today
* You’ve an important project
* You have people coming over later
* You haven’t done all your chores
* It’s the anniversary of your dog’s death and you’re too sad
* It’s too hot
* It’s too cold
* You have a blister
* You got sunburnt
* It’s too late to gym now
* It’s the wrong time to gym, it’s too busy
* Your training buddy is busy
* Your favourite training tank is drying
* You can’t find any shorts
* You’re just not feeling it
* You really should be practising flute
* You think your rings might be haunted
* You’re a bit constipated

There really are a lot of reasons your training could be sub-optimal, and I’m willing to bet that every single session you’ve had has been sub-optimal. A lot of them are legitimate too. So what’s the worst that could happen, what are you really worried will happen?

* You might not get all your reps
* You might have slightly sloppy form
* You might not feel great

Fly into the wind with your excuses, but then ask yourself what you’re afraid of. Maybe it’s nothing.",2018-01-11 12:10:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7pno3p/theory_thursday_why_you_suck_and_how_to_use_that/

I'm really enjoying it and I'm already starting to see improvements. One side effect that id not expected to hit me quite so hard is the lack of energy even during rest days.

Obviously exercise impacts energy levels, and I'm no stranger to exercise having followed training routines in the past (albeit relatively fleetingly). But this time round I'm really struggling with general energy levels, and tiredness. Not necessarily in the muscles and I still seem to have energy for workouts, but I'm SO TIRED all the time.

I'm hitting between 3500 - 4000 calories a day according to myfitnesspall. I'm very skinny, bulking.

Daily routine is something like this:

5am: get up, walk/run with dog for 45 -60 minutes. Coffee, small breakfast, go to work. If it's not raining I'll bring my rings with me and  incorporate my training during the dog walk.

8am: get to work, breakfast number 2. Work/reddit/Assorted snacks.

1-2pm lunchtime, big meal. Go for a walk.

2pm: Work/reddit/Assorted snacks until home time.

6:30-7pm: leave work.

8pm: get home, big dinner, work out if I didn't do it in the morning. On a rest day I'll take half an hour to do some stretching or yoga.

Then I just eat eat eat until I go to bed between 10 and 11.

Not much downtime, although I am generally sat at my desk for most of the day. Pretty stressful fast paced office job though. Sure others in here are in the same boat... 

How long did it take you all to adjust to the extra work you're doing? Do you even get used to it or is it just how life is?

Personally, I fell into the practice during my time at university, and like many others, the tradition of lifting or running soon after stumbling out of bed has grown on me. I described my initial attempts at early morning workouts as



   **""Get Dressed, Drink coffee and get to the gym before I realize what the fuck I'm doing.""**




If this is your first time hitting the weights or lacing up the running shoes before dawn; expect it to feel uncomfortable at first. It took me a couple weeks to get into the habit of going to bed earlier, waking up early and moving in the morning rather then lounging around eating oatmeal. It does get better,  your bodies has the ability to adapt to just about anything, just look at Wim Hof  The Ice Man;  5:00 am workouts can feel natural once you get into a rhythm. That being said, there are certainly wrong & right ways of going about your morning workout.

Here are commonly experienced problems associated with morning training and some possible solutions you can take to fix them:


**1. You're jumping too quickly into your workout**


If you've already attempted the early morning workout, you may have already done this by accident. You woke up early feeling stiff & groggy, stumbled out bed to make yourself a coffee or take a pre-workout mix and within minutes of swigging back your drink of choice you're on fire. A quick trip to the gym and a couple sets into your workout and it hits you; your body is just plain not ready for this.

Unfortunately, the morning buzz caused by  the natural rise of morning cortisol, spikes and then sharply dips mid morning. With the potential addition of caffeine, this can lead many to have a false sense of confidence causing them to rush into their workouts and crash. While you might feel psychologically ready, your body physically hasn't woken up and is likely not ready for intense exercise yet.  There are many reasons for this: throughout the night your body temperature drops, you become  dehydrated and your nervous system shifts to a parasympathetic state (rest& digest); shifting from this state to heavy exertion is far from ideal. Attempting to power through this induced physiological state is usually an exercise in futility: you are more  prone to injury, you're cold and your nervous is not firing yet.


**The solution: Take some time in the morning to wake your body up.**

In my experience, as well as in the anecdotes of many others, you want to give yourself at least an hour or two between waking up and performing any high level of activity. Use the extra time to do a proper  warm up, I suggest doing some full body dynamic stretching, blood flow movements and mobility work to wake your muscles up. Prior to getting to the gym, the morning hours can be a great time to be productive, get some work done, read, meditate, journal or  start scheduling your day.  Performing a morning routine is an excellent way to reset, prioritize and build momentum throughout the rest of the day. Advocates of such routines, include high achievers & professional athletes who attribute their success to maximizing this morning period. The point of this time is to not get more shit done per say, its to prepare your body and mind for doing the shit you already have to do better.

**Here's some potential ideas:**

   * Practice Yoga or Stretching - Try doing a few Sun Salutations

   * Meditate for ~10 minutes - The HeadSpace app is excellent.

   * Journal - I like to write out my daily goals, habits and ideas

   * Perform some Breathing exercise - Take a look at The Wim Hof Method

   * Read something constructive - start your day off with something to think about.

   * Get outside - Let your dog out, stretch and expose yourself to daylight

   * Brew good Coffee: use an Aeropress, Pour-over or Frenchpress with a scale.


**2. You don't know how to fuel it properly**


There are two types of people in the morning: those who wake up ravenously hungry and those who get sick  as a dog even at the thought of food. Personally, I've found that regardless of whether or not you're hungry; most people are better off skipping breakfast or eating something very light before training.  When you eat anything, your body diverts blood flow away from your muscles to you're digestive system, making you sluggish, cold and lethargic. Provided you ate properly the day before, your body has more than enough stored energy in the form of muscle glycogen to get you through your workout. Make sure to eat a solid meal consisting of a decent dose of each macro nutrient (Complex Carbs, Protein, Fat)  ~3 hours before bedtime; this will not only hold you off through your workout, you'll likely sleep better as well.

Often, another area many trainees overlook is the importance of hydration, which critical; especially if you are training first thing in the morning. Throughout the night your body dehydrates via respiration & lack of fluid intake, by waking up and downing a large cup (~500-1000ml) of water, you can save yourself from cognitive impairment, decreased performance and stress tolerance. Unfortunately for you coffee lovers,  while a cup of Joe can be an excellent addition to your morning ritual, it should not count towards your fluid intake. A good rule of thumb, beyond the recommended 8 cups of water per day,  is to simply drink to thirst and aim to consume 1 L of water per hour of exercise.

That being said, the combination of not eating and getting up early can leave people feeling grumpy, slow and  having a sub par training experience. The ideal solution in my opinion is to have your favorite caffeinated drink, preferable one that is hot, to begin warm up the body, increase satiety and performance.

   * A cup of Black Coffee - my personal favourite

   * Expresso / Americano - For a little extra boost

   * Green Tea - Matcha, Sencha, etc (Matcha tends to deliver the highest dos of caffeine)

   * Black Tea/ Other Teas- , Earl Grey, Chai, Yerba Mate , Oolong, etc

You can also use your favorite pre-workout supplement, although I do not advocate these products as many of them are loaded with caffeine, useless ingredients and artificial sweeteners. If you feel like you need an extra boost, here are some other additions you might consider taking prior to your workout.

    * 30g of Fast Digesting Protein  - Whey, Hemp, etc

    * 5g Creatine Monohydrate

    * 15g Coconut or MCT oil - Great with Coffee (Bulletproof Coffee)

    * 5-10g BCAA - Branched Chain Amino Acids

    * L- Theanine

    * Citruline

    * Tyrosine


**3. You didn't prepare the day before.**

When attempting the early morning workout, the most common mistake new gym goers make is lack of planning and preparation. They assume their decision making capabilities will be on point upon waking and they leave it to the morning to figure out all their  necessities for work, gym and food for the day. This is a recipe for disaster; science shows upon waking you are virtually impaired, making your more prone to mistakes, panicking and fucking up the rest of your day. The solution is to simply form a plan, taking into consideration everything you'll need for success the day  prior to your session. Ask yourself the following  questions: what clothing will I wear during and after? Am I eating before or not? What's your gym routine like that day? how will you transition to the workplace or classroom? Will I make or buy coffee?


These seemingly mundane tasks & simple decisions become surprisingly difficult to make at the crack of dawn. By taking the initiative  the day before, you can figure out a game plan that saves you from decision fatigue and depletion of  willpower for the rest of the day.

Here's a couple ways you can make your mornings run a little more smoothly the night before:

    * Lay out your gym clothing / Pack a change of clothing

    * Set your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier than your wake up time
    * Go to bed early aim for a minimum of 7 hours sleep

    * Have any food for day ready to go in the fridge

    * Drink at least 500ml of water upon waking. (resets circadian rhythm)
    * Use a simple method of brewing coffee

    * Don't leave your house in mess (dirty dishes, clothing,etc)

    * Do NOT Look at you email, Instagram, Facebook, etc

    * Go to the washroom before the gym.


**4. You're overworked, stressed and getting too little sleep**


Often, the same people willing to try early morning workouts also have a tendency towards having  a Type A personality. Sadly, this go get'em mentality can get folks in trouble sometimes, convincing them they  can  maximize their productivity at some unknown expense to their health, relationships and mental well being.

Getting up early and exercising is adding yet another stress on your body, and  it shouldn't be an excuse to attempt to pack more into your already overflowing schedule. If your lifestyle is one that requires you to work excessive hours, frequently disrupts your sleep  and has you running constantly on adrenaline & caffeine; throwing an intense morning workout into the mix might be overkill. Even if this strategy works short term, eventually  the continuous strain on your adrenal glands, the hyper-vigilant state and lack of sleep will catch up to you.

Burning yourself out in this manner can even lead to the development of some pretty severe conditions, chronic stress  predisposes you to  autoimmune disease, hormonal dysfunction, metabolic problems, cardiovascular disease and even diabetes; leaving you unable to fulfill any of your previous your lifestyle engagements. I can certainly attest to these consequences, as someone who has fallen into this trap before thinking burnout was a myth; I landed myself in the hospital. Luckily, there are some pre-emptive warning signs you'll begin experiencing when your overdoing it: like having extreme difficulty waking up in the mornings, losing sex drive, and experiencing midday day crashes.

For these people, if they're about to embark on a demanding work day I'd rather they spend those early hours practicing yoga, going for a walk or taking advantage of a little extra sleep. If 5:30am is the only time of day you have to fulfill your dream of becoming a high level cross fitter, attaining an amazing physique or is your justification for  yesterdays late night drinks: you need to reset your priorities. Working out in the morning occasionally is a struggle, even for the veteran gym goer, yet when its near impossible to drag yourself out of bed in the morning, let alone underneath a barbell, you are not living a lifestyle conducive to training.

In order to feel well rested and minimize adrenal stress, here are some general recommendations I suggest to clients with a busy schedule:

    * Eat a solid meal within 3 hours of falling asleep

    * Avoid all electronics or screen time One hour before bedtime

    * Make Evenings a time to ""decompress"" (socialize, read, learn an instrument, etc)

    * Avoid Caffeine and all other stimulants after 2:00pm

    * Ensure you get natural sun exposure at some-point in the morning

    * Take 5 - Deep Breathes to ""reset"" before heading out

    * Keep workouts short and intense ( Roughly one hour)

    * Start a quick meditation practice



**Wrapping Things Up**

If I've inspired you to give morning training a shot, or have made you reconsider your approach; Great! This daily ritual goes far beyond building up your fitness, it's taught me time management, discipline, preparation and developed plain old grit. Like many other pursuits in self improvement, you cannot sugar coat this process, it ultimately comes down to gradual changes over time, being consistency and putting in the effort. There are mornings you will want to rip the alarm clock off the table and throw it at the wall, spill boiling coffee on yourself or wear your shirt inside out; embrace them. These minor imperfections,failures and mistakes all actually contribute to your growth as an individual, just as tearing your muscles and stressing your heart makes you fit. My suggestion is to challenge yourself, give morning training a try, you might surprise yourself!

638sjn,bodyweightfitness,My Experiment With Ketosis (And Strength Work),"**Start with Conclusion**

Ketosis helped me lose a lot of weight over 31 days. However, my workouts suffered lower energy, slightly decreased strength, and an injury. I would not do full time Ketosis again but might consider Cyclic Ketosis or Ketosis for a week during cuts.

**Stats**

Before ketosis (measurements right at the end of non-ketosis bulk): 167lbs @ 5'7"", 38 years old

After 31 days of ketosis: 159lbs

**Details**

Ketosis involves eating a lot of fat, very little carbs (I aimed for less than 20g) and moderate protein. I only tracked my carbs independently of total calories so it's possible I ate too much protein for really pure ketosis. I cheated carbs on two days (too much popcorn one day and new ramen shop the other day.) I consumed the fat by eating canned sardines, a lot of cheese, putting heavy cream in my coffee/tea, ordering beef/pork belly more than chicken.

When I first started, I suffered minor low carb mental fogginess for a day, then really minor fogginess the day after. I immediately lost 3-4 lbs, so that's probably water weight. So, of the 8lbs I lost, half was water weight, probably.

Around the middle, my progressions got stronger, and I actually hit a personal record of low counterweight assist for 3RM OAP. But, by the end, my progressions all got a little weaker with the exception of my front lever and human flag both of which got a few seconds stronger. Given that I lost 4 to 8lbs throughout the 30 days, I thought my One Armed Chin would have gotten stronger, but my counterweight assist remained the same (which technically means I got weaker!) Also, towards the end of the experiment, I found my energy dropping towards the end of the workout to the point I could only do half my normal time on L-Sits!

Also, I pulled a muscle doing my workout for the first time in years. This may have nothing to do with Ketosis as it was the same day as my personal record for OAP. The injury may have contributed to my lower numbers at the end, but it only slowed me down for 2 workouts...

**Next Steps**

I may try carb cycling but more than likely I will just go to a ""clean carb"" program where I only eat certain carbs like whole grains and brown rices. That should reduce my carb snacking during cuts but keep my energy high during workouts. I will probably continue to snack on high fat foods for bulking (I like sardines, cheese and cream!)

**EDIT**

A lot of good comments are asking if I was bulking or cutting. I was loosely tracking calories and aiming for a slight bulk of 200 extra calories. However, the fact that I lost weight, suggests that I may actually have been cutting and my tracking was off! Thus, the cutting may have resulted in the loss of strength NOT the no carbs.

Many people have said that part of the reason ketosis works, not just metabolically, is that high fat foods satiate and you end up eating less calories in general. Looking back, I realize I did not finish a lot of my meals, which may have contributed to unintentional cutting (ie, I counted a whole chicken breast when I only at 3/4 of it.)

SO: For me, Ketosis WITH THE AMOUNT IF CALORIES I CONSUMED led to a loss of performance. I was aiming for a bulk but obviously had a hard time sticking to the bulk while on Ketosis.

Additionally, it is possible that my body is not as efficient at digesting and processing calories from fat as it is from other foods (protein or carbs.) So, there are too many variables!

TL;DR: Was trying to eat to surplus, ended up with my abs looking great but my OAP is slightly weaker than when I started. What a confusing diet!

[Video of dips!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnhuYRIJWOQ)

After this and 2 more unrecorded sets of 11 and 5 each, I experienced pain in my left tricep/elbow area when I did more dips or other triceps exercises, which [seems like it can be fixed by resting](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5tiz9p/am_i_injured/ddmueq9/).

The latter 3 workouts are done in the morning while the former in the afternoon (maybe time of the day affects performance?). That workout might also be an anomaly since the rep count for the workouts before that were

5r5vt9,bodyweightfitness,Your full guide to getting into the zone (additions welcomed).,"#**What Is Flow Or 'The Zone'?**

Flow is a state where you function outside of yourself. Your body and mind in flow work together, like an efficient machine.

Being in a state of flow is commonly referred to as being ‘in the zone’.

**Basketball, writing, acting, anything that you enjoy doing is an opportunity for you to experience flow.**

Flow is a state of mind where you simultaneously become extraordinarily productivity and efficiency.

**So how can we get in flow or 'in the zone' at the gym to train hard as hell?**

Being selective about gym partners give you many similar benefits.

#**Be Competetive and Selective**

Be selective about people’s benefit to you, rather than their friendly smile. This way you’re essentially going to be creating an environment more favourable towards flow.

#**If you’re at the gym and you’re trying to be most efficient with your time, small-talk is nothing but a disfavour to yourself, save this for the coffee shop.**

The feeling of being in flow with other people can become addictive and once you form an ‘addiction’ to a feeling that gives you nothing but good health, you’ve essentially created a powerful success system.

**I have previously touched on the idea of the ego and how we must silence it, but the ego isn’t necessarily a bad thing in certain cases.**

To recognise ego and submit to it without fully falling under its alluding sovereignty, gives you nothing but power and control over your desired goals.

When you are competing against others, essentially you are favouring your ego, but if the ego is inflated strategically, you can use this instinctual primal instinct to impress and compete to benefit you in this one specific circumstance.

To separate your ego from the competitive spirit is to view the situation like so:

When in competeition, your victory is not derived from beating other people, in a sport such as weight lifting where the instrisic satisfaction comes from knowing you have beaten yourself.

To the untrained flow is something that just happens, it may perplex the ignorant that one may, in fact, be able to control the frequency of flow state.

The way you approach flow for the gym can be slightly different than how you would approach it for a more creative art such as writing, so I’m going to give you some strategic ways to get in the zone while you’re working out.

The way you approach flow for the gym can be slightly different than how you would approach it for a more creative practice such as writing.

Firstly we must form a clear and distinct purpose of why we want to get in flow. The simple way to look at training is to be the most efficient, get the most reward in the shortest amount of time and of course enjoy what you’re doing.

#**Choose A Specific Target**
 



 

If you’re trying to increase your muscle up ability, but you are also attempting to sprint at 12 seconds for a 100-meter dash; realistically how do you expect to do both in an efficient manner.

Have a clear goal and direct all your efforts in the gym, to in some way, bring you closer to this goal. It’s similar to using your reticular activation system (focus lens) of your brain for retaining information.

**It’s similar to using your reticular activation system (focus lens) of your brain for retaining information.**

Picture your mind as a focus lens and focus on only what brings you closer to the goal you are keen to grasp, ignore what exists in the unfocused image, even if it’s pretty.

**You can only truly focus on your fullest potential on something you like to do and it goes the same for your exercise.**

If you’ve set a goal, then chances are you like the idea actualizing this goal. To introspect on your goal makes one happy, at least for a brief moment.

If we take the near cliche virtue of enjoying the journey more than the goal; we take this into practice for the above.

You must find more pleasure in the journey or in other words the tools (exercises), twice as much as the goal being achieved itself.

You must focus your actions to align closely with your goal. If your goal is to do 20 consecutive dead-hang pull ups, you’re going to effortlessly take a backseat watching yourself become immersed in actualizing your goal.

#**Maximum Exertion**
 



**Some level of risk is necessary for flow to happen.** Progressing and attempting to move past your previous best is a risk, it’s a risk because on a subconscious level your body recognises the risk of injury.

**It’s a risk because you’re moving your body 1% past your comfort zone.**

Your muscle fibres, your central nervous system (CNS) are undergoing foreign, unwarranted loads which force yourself into flow.

This is much more applicable as you become more advanced. Over time your muscles and CNS adapt and it becomes more difficult to progress in a linear fashion as it may of in the beginning.

Flow is going to be extremely important in this regard to continuously improve past the intermediate-advanced stage.

To push past this comfort zone automatically puts you in flow; without this selfless voluntary discomfort, the possibility of flow is improbable.

**Within reason and consideration for your personal limits, cultivate the inner and outer strength to push your body as frequently as you can.**

Through time come to understand and appreciate the need to push yourself when you’re getting too comfortable.

Normalise pushing yourself and you will normalise the feeling of being in flow.

Who do you see concentrating and being in the zone more: The person who is always bettering themselves and pushing hard; or the person who is talking on their phone and pushing the same weight week after week?

It’s a rather extreme example on paper, but the truth is this is the reality of what separate winner from losers in a gym environment and in life general.

#**The Right Environment**
 



The ‘right environment’ is hard to define as it is subjective. In terms of the purpose for a stoic minded person, training revolves around efficiency.

**The ‘right environment’ for a gym is one that allows you to train without judgement.**

Many commercial gyms are too professional and PC in their concern for behaviour. You don’t have to scream and grunt for every single repetition, but it’s important to exist in an environment which condones this.

Working out is animalistic, we pull ourselves ups bars cause we're hairless pink monkeys. (as Joe Rogan would say lol)

Having the comfort and peace of mind, knowing that without judgement you can fully exert yourself, just as we may have done in the past for our own survival allows one to act, rather than react.

Why should you as somebody wanting to train as hard as possible, for even one second dismiss your desire to fully push yourself.

**One must question the nature and vibe of contemporary gym establishments.**

**Find a gym with at least a little bit of rust.**

Make this a priority; finding like-minded people in a like-minded environment. This will be a potent ingredient for your recipe of success.

#**Key Points**

* *The right environment*
* *Great training partners at a similar level who are motivated and committed.*
* *Have clear goals and intents when stepping into the training room.*
* *Aim to break PRs often, take calculated risks.*
* *Music can help for some.*

5eej76,bodyweightfitness,...Might as well start,"Hi, I've been lurking around the threads for a while debating on wheather or not to post something, and after a lot of thought, and a video that got me motivated, I decided to try and ask for help.

1.) Does anyone feel like coffee helps improve their workout? For me, personally, I feel a small boost (the caffeine) after drinking it and heading to workout. I workout at 5am so sometimes having a quick shot of coffee gives me great results.

2.) I can't STAND black coffee. I tried, I really tried. I have to put at least 1 tbsp of sugar-free creamer, but my only concern is that it has 2.5g of SATURATED fats. I only have one cup a day, but I also like to cook with a bit of butter in the morning with my eggs. It appears that I'm reaching 17% of my daily value of saturated fats just in the morning. Does anyone know how potentially harmful this can be if you have a CLEAN diet the rest of the day and workout at least 3x a week?

52eygo,bodyweightfitness,Two doubts on RR in the early morning,"So, it seems there are many of you out there who like their routine in the early morning. So do I, and I'm thinking about starting the recommended one in the same time slot.

But reading around the sub, I have found a couple of info that I would like to know more about:

1. I have often read about avoiding heavy loaded exercises in the first waking hour, and this is because of the intervertebral disks' hydration. I calculated that between washing my face, drinking the coffee, preparing the equipment, taking care of the cat, and the warmup and skill work, it would probably be an hour after leaving the bed that I'll start the strength work. And so I felt safe. BUT, I then learnt that [the study people quotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/11uvwc/working_out_in_the_morning/) talks about ""spine-bending manoeuvres"". And so I thought: is it possible that I should wait an hour also for the warmup and skill work? Or the sentence only refers to heavy loading?

2. Many of you start working out on an empty stomach (as I always did), but I've read it could be beneficial to get some coffee (for various reasons) and some proteins before doing the work. Now, the coffee is not a problem, but I'm not sure about bananas and apple (as I've seen suggested around here). I'm trying to get all my proteins without powders of sort, but I think I'd feel more at ease during the exercises without solids in my stomach. So I thought about asking you guys what my options could be. How about a raw egg in the coffee? It looks less disgusting that it sounds :)",2016-09-12 15:41:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/52eygo/two_doubts_on_rr_in_the_early_morning/
51ylo8,bodyweightfitness,"[Progress] 3 month cut and RR (M/21/5'8"")","Obviously pics first:

&nbsp;

[6/14/16](http://i.imgur.com/8qLJ4nO.jpg) - ~160 lbs (no scale, guestimate based on 160.4 lbs on 5/27/16)

- The first day I started taking pictures. My cut started a little bit earlier but I hadn't really made any noticeable progress

&nbsp;

[7/14/16](http://i.imgur.com/EA9D1ap.jpg) - ~155 lbs (still no scale, interpolating between end of May and end of July..)

- One month in. A little discouraged by the slow progress but I kept on powering through.

&nbsp;

[8/14/16](http://i.imgur.com/4qnAecK.jpg) - 148.2 lbs (finally bought a scale!)

- Two months in. Still slow visual progress but I was making decent strength progress.

&nbsp;

[9/9/16](http://i.imgur.com/HRty6cN.jpg) - 144.6 lbs

- Last day of my 3 month cut. Unfortunately I moved on September 1st so the lighting is drastically different.

&nbsp;

My relationship with my weight has been all over the place (I have a graph that I can post later if I can find it). My heaviest was in December of 2012, weighing in at 190 lbs (pic later maybe). From there I dropped down to a low of 154 lbs in July of 2013, primarily from an excessive amount of cardio. From there I rubber banded between 170 and 160 for the next two and a half years. I reached a recent max of 170 lbs in January of 2016 and decided that this was the time I was going to lose and keep off the weight, as well as finally put on some muscle. I started running and do some dumbbell exercises but didn't really have the best plan (I was using the Dumbbell Stopgap). I only lost about 10 lbs from January to May.

I graduated college in May and was still pretty unhappy with how I looked. I moved across the country in June and was determined to ACTUALLY get in better shape, instead of what happened the first half of the year. I have done the RR in the past but was pretty lenient with the form and the programming so I never made any real progress.

&nbsp;

**Diet**

I am one of those people who can eat the same thing day in and day out, so I take advantage of that. I aimed for 1550 calories a day. Sometimes I was under, sometimes I was over, but I tried to not get too hard on myself about that. I meticulously tracked on MFP for the entirety of my cut.

Weekday breakfast (same thing every day): banana and protein shake (1 scoop Rich Chocolate Pure Protein , 1 Tbsp peanut butter, 12 oz unsweetened almond milk): 375 calories

Weekday lunch (same thing every day, changed every week): I like to prep 4-5 days worth of food on Sunday and portion it out and eat it all week long. Meals typically consisted of a large helping of protein and a side of vegetables: ~600-800 calories

Weekday dinner (some variation, not a ton): I am pretty tired after work so my meals usually are some form of protein (mostly italian sausage or chicken) cooked with black beans, 2-3 scrambled eggs, and a few scoops of salsa: ~500-600 calories

Weekday snack: If I was low on calories on an RR day, I would usually have an extra tablespoon of peanut butter or some cold cuts later in the evening.

Weekends were all over the places. Breakfast were usually something with eggs and breakfast meat. Lunch and dinner I often went out to eat but tried to be careful with what I bought and tracked it if it was available (shoutout to In 'n Out Burger!). If I cooked it was usually something similar to my weekday dinners.

&nbsp;

**Routine**

I have stuck to the vanilla RR since June, working out M/W/F. I didn't have a pull up bar or rings until the first week of July.

&nbsp;

Start:

All the warmups, 60s for all bodyline work, no handstand work, no support work.

0 pull ups

0 dips

3x8 body weight squats

3x20s foot supported l-sit

3x8 push ups

3x8 vertical rows

&nbsp;

Current:

All the warmups, 60s plank/hollow hold, 30s side/back plank/arch, no handstand work, no support work. (Note: I did do support work on off days for July and August but have since dropped it after progressing to 3x30s RTO hold)

3x6 pull ups

3x3 ring dips

3x4 assisted pistol squats (holding on to the door frame)

3x30s foot supported l-sit (I made decent progress but have since reset since I think my form was bad and I wasn't depressing my shoulders properly)

3x5 PPPUs

3x5 horizontal ring rows

&nbsp;

I made a lot of excuses during my training. I didn't train any support holds or dips until I had my rings. After I managed 3x30s support hold, I started doing my own progression for ring dips. I did what I would call ""leg assisted dip negatives"" where most of my weight was held up by my arms but I assisted with my legs as necessary. I am sure it was not ideal but I have since progressed to full ROM (including RTO) ring dips!

&nbsp;

**Off Days**

Cardio definitely helped speed up my weight loss. On my off days (T/Th/Sa) I would go for a ~20 minute run, usually around an 8:30 pace. I have recently switched to jumping rope instead and am working my way up from 10 minutes a day. I also have (as of this week) added compression work into my off days with the hopes of improving my L-sit. Part of my L-sit reset was due to getting stuck at 3x25s one foot supported without being able to do any amount of tuck L-sit (I know this is a common problem).

&nbsp;

**What I Learned and What's Next**

- These last three months have really hammered home to me that diet is the only true way to lose weight: you can't outrun a bad diet.

- Progress is definitely not linear. I was frustrated and stuck at 3x3 pull ups for weeks before finally breaking past it. I plateaued a lot, but always have made it through, often with better form!

- Working out in the morning is definitely the best time for me, I have absolutely no energy or motivation at the end of the day. I wake up at 6:45am on weekdays, do the RR or cardio, and leave for work by 8am. The boost of energy is also phenomenal, I haven't needed coffee since June.

Going forward, I am switching to a slow bulk/recomp for the foreseeable future (probably until December). I am the lowest weight I have been since probably middle school but there isn't a whole lot of muscle underneath, which is something I hope to change.

While my progress may not be as extreme as some, I am happy enough that I felt it was worth of sharing with you guys. This subreddit has been invaluable to me and I cannot even begin to say how much I appreciate the endless amount of resources and feedback that's available. If you made it this far, thanks for reading and feel free to post any comments, questions, or critiques!

4zis4o,bodyweightfitness,Thoughts on tools like BetterBack (physical braces) to improve posture?,"I work from coffee shops often and am seated on a bench for much of today. No back support. My lower back starts aching a bit and I compensate by getting all Computer Guy. Aside from standing up every 30 mins and doing some dynamic stretching and movement, I think I'd like to get some type of support.

Does anyone have a take on this product, or these types of products? Is there a specific stretch I could do to help my back? My low back strength is good; 3 months ago, I was repping 400lb deadlifts weighing in at 190lbs. 

Specific product: http://getbetterback.com/

4v1jn2,bodyweightfitness,My BWF/RR equipment,"Pictures first: http://imgur.com/a/IegNN

I've seen a few posts asking about equipment for the RR, so I thought I'd share what I'm using.  
  
I wanted to have minimal stuff, keep the cost down, and have something that I could use as I progressed. I also wanted it to be freestanding (no wall/door mounts), and I wanted to be able to take it apart for transport. As such, I ended up designing a simple pullup rack that I could hang rings from.  
  
I designed it on paper to use 4 2x4's, a section of pipe, and floor flanges. The base pieces are 36 inches, the height is 80 inches, and the angles are 45 degrees. I used a 3 foot length of pipe with a 1 inch OD. Everything is held together with 3 inch deck screws.  
  
If you want to cut costs and don't mind ring pullups, you could replace the pipe with wood. For added stability, you could replace the uprights with 4x4s. If you're going to swing, you will probably want a longer base.  
  
I had previously made the bench/coffee table out of 2x4's, and found it's good for step ups and for elevating the feet for rows.",2016-07-28 16:21:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4v1jn2/my_bwfrr_equipment/
4uu33k,bodyweightfitness,LPT: Integrate activity in your room,"Hi everyone! I've just recently started the RR and so I started setting up my room to better accommodate it. 

[Here's a photo](http://imgur.com/a/7VJfJ). I live in my aunt's place since it's near the uni where I take my master's degree that's why there's a lot of stuff that I pushed towards the back to get the most space that I can. As you can see, I'm on pure pleb mode. Just some cheap kiddie mats (what the hell), a swiss ball I got from my cousin (she only used it once), DIY collapsible PVC parallel bars, IronGym, yoga mat, and dollar store resistance bands.

Setting this ""activity place"" in my room completely changed my perspective and daily routine. Since it's near my bed, I would lounge around this area instead. I think that especially for beginners like me, having this setup greatly increases the probability that I'll spend my time practicing as well as integrate fitness to my mundane tasks. I could slip a few seconds of skill/move practices that I wouldn't have done in the past since it wasn't this convenient. Some examples of what I did these past few days:

* Squat sits while checking mail
* Laid down and tried to get sleepy, got bored and did hamstring stretches and practiced my hollow hold
* Woke up from a nap then straight up practiced my dive rolls
* Discovered I can now get to an L-sit while drinking my morning coffee
* Built a gundam kit while lying on my chest on the swiss ball practicing diaphragmatic breathing
* Practiced my support hold on the parallel bars while ""air-walking"" with Spotify music
* Thoracic spine stretch by lying with my back on the swiss ball after a long day while browsing reddit
* Greatly improved some of my asanas' form while waiting for sites to load on my phone
* Squat sits while watching series
 

And lots more. Basically, I just increased my matted space. Yours could be different, but **as long as it made doing bwf stuff more accessible and integrate-able to your daily routine, it will work wonders.**

BONUS: [I posted some nifty stuff on my wall](http://imgur.com/a/hJwFA). It greatly helps me with form,cues,progression. Also, improve my breathing.

**EDIT:** Sorry it wasn't initially clearer. This might look gimmicky and a waste of time to intermediate bwfers, but I think this is helpful for beginners to drill in proper form and cues, as well as stretch and address some imbalances by essentially practicing/familiarizing while doing other activities. Lastly, if it feels like another load of mental stress and chores that you must take on during your down time, then don't do it. As has been repeated, the best program (be it diet or exercise) is the one that you can follow consistently.",2016-07-27 11:15:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4uu33k/lpt_integrate_activity_in_your_room/
1f0z4d9,weightroom,USAPL WA Summer End Meet Report. Men's Raw Open 100kg,"First meet completed! Really happy with how it went and looking forward to attending another next year.  
  
**Background:**  
28M. Been lifting since high school, but in terms of serious focus on S/B/D I’d say training since \~2019. Haven’t ever competed before, just been running a variety of programs centered around the big 3 (SS, GZCL, SBS programs, 531). I typically run those programs along side some form of consistent cardio (usually 3x/wk jogs) since I don't want to be that guy who lifts a lot but gets out of breath going up the stairs (at least, not any more haha).  
  
**Training / Prep:**  
Last year in fall I got after a bulk using u/MythicalStrength’s [6 month bulking super-program](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/j5q2ez/6_months_of_eating_and_training_for_mass_laid_out/). Finished out 531 BBB Beefcake and Building the Monolith (yes, with the beef and eggs). Didn’t end up going on to deep water because my weight had gone 220lb->245lb from the first 3 months and I was ready to start cutting back down a bit. At that point I decided I’d compete at USAPL WA Summer End, with the goal to make my way down to the 100kg weight class.   
  
I started my cut in March, running SBS RtF and a moderate deficit. Weight came off at a nice steady pace. At the start of July I pivoted my programming to Greg Nuckol’s version of [Bulgarian method training.](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-bulgarian-method/) This had me working up to a daily minimum / daily maximum on Squat/Bench 4-6 days a week. After hitting my daily max for each I did 3x3 at \~90% of the daily max plus 2 assistance movements at the end of the workout. I would deadlift for 10 singles at 80%1RM 1-2x a week. Next time around I'll deadlift more leading up to the meet, I didn't feel very confident in my deadlifts due to the low frequency / minimal high intensity. I ran 3 miles 2-3 times per week, and did 2 mile 75lb vest walks with my dogs on any lifting day that I wasn't running.

Life was a bit chaotic from April-June and very chaotic in July and August for personal reasons, but I got in the gym regardless and at least ate ‘good enough’ to both support my training and get my weight down to around 215lb. Sleep was not where it should be (6-7hr most nights, too many 4-5hr or less nights) but that's not new for me. Home gym / WFH is a dream for this - as I can step out for a workout whenever is convenient in my day.

In terms of diet - while cutting I targeted 2.5k cal and controlled my breakfast/lunch/snacks to be consistently high protein (protein bar breakfast, turkey/broccoli bowl lunch, yogurt / protein powder / other protein source for snacks) and tried to leave \~1k calories so I could eat whatever my wife and I would make for dinner / potentially dine out.

I also went on a 'caffeine resensitization' for the 3 weeks before the meet. Went cold turkey on caffeine so I would be sensitive to it again on meet day. Couple days of sluggishness / headache but not bad. Honestly missed the coffee itself more than the caffeine effects.

  
**Meet:**  
The venue was local, the gym I used to lift at before I got my home gym set up actually. Love that place so it was nice to be back and made it feel like a ‘home game.’  
  
They split the 5 flights into 2 sessions, I was in the last flight of the day so I weighed in around noon. Kept my breakfast light and waited to eat/drink much more though that was probably unnecessary. Weighed in at 96.5kg. After 1st attempt selections were in I realized I had picked the heaviest squat and bench openers in men’s 100kg (only 5 of us), which made me second guess myself for a moment but I also knew they were weights I could hit for a few reps in the gym.  
  
**Squat:**  
1st: 195kg ✓. Moved ez, got me through the ‘first time lifting with an audience’ nerves.  
  
2nd: 205kg ✓. Also smooth.  
  
3rd: 215kg ✓. Still smooth! Could have reached for more honestly but this matched my PR at the end of my bulk when I was 30lb heavier.  
  
**Bench:**  
1st: 132.5kg ✓. Went up shaky and I stuck a bit midway, still a good lift! I tried something new with my wrist wraps which was a bad idea.  
  
2nd: 140kg ✓. Same as the first, but without my wraps (had trained without for the last month anyhow due to a new forearm tattoo).  
  
3rd: 145kg X. Smooth as butter, but I jumped the start cue! Got myself all hyped up and finally took the time to really get my setup locked in. Bar felt so light when I unracked it that I just started benching without thinking. Realized while waiting for the ‘press’ cue that I never heard a ‘start’ cue. Had to happen eventually, I’m just glad it was a 3rd attempt so I didn’t psych myself out.  
  
**Deadlift:**  
1st: 200kg ✓. Solid opener, no issues!  
  
2nd: 212.5kg ✓. Also moved well.  
  
3rd: 217.5kg ✓. Still smooth! Honestly could have gone for more. I felt shakiest about deadlift going into this as the heaviest I had gone in the last couple months was around 475lb and I had not put much focus on deadlifting in my last 2 months of training.  
  
**Results:**  
[Video for all 9 attempts here.](https://imgur.com/a/cbI46YQ)  
  
Very happy going 8/9 at my first meet and exceeding my goal of 1250lb total. I got 1st in the Men’s Raw Open 100kg division with a total of 572.5kg/1271lb, my squat put me far enough ahead to shore up the difference from the stronger deadlifters.  
  
For overall based on DOTS I was 8th with a DOTS of 358. Pretty good - I want that 400 DOTS though!  
  
**Conclusions:**  
Feeling great about my first meet. Met some cool people and had a great time hyping each other up and talking out our ‘first meet nerves’ while warming up. People weren’t kidding about how supportive powerlifting is. We’re all there to compete but at the end of the day everyone just wants to put up some big numbers and see everyone around them do the same. The adrenaline of lifting in front of a crowd makes these lifts feel so much lighter than they do when I'm alone in my garage, I had hit a 465lb squat a few weeks beforehand and it was much more of a grind than 215kg/474lb was yesterday.  
  
Definitely signing up for this meet again next year. Doing the 10k swing challenge next so I can take a break from squatting and get work done on the shoulder part of my sleeve. After that going to go on a (cleaner) winter bulk followed by a cut down for the 100kg class again. Next time around putting more focus on deadlift during my meet prep, and locking in my diet/sleep a bit more.

1cfb4nu,weightroom,"[Write-up] Deloading with a 5,000 Vest Squat Challenge","I had **three** goals for this week:

1. Deload from my usual high volume lifting
2. Do 5,000 squats with a weight vest on
3. Lose a couple pounds



In order to do this I basically mixed together **Dan john’s** easy strength for fat loss with a personal 5,000 squats in a week challenge. Here’s the basics of what I took from Dan John’s program:

* Wake up and drink coffee
* Do a fasted workout
* Go for a walk immediately
* Eat and get on with your day

The idea behind this actually comes from Rusty Moore. It’s about freeing up fatty acids with a good night's sleep, coffee, fasting, intense exercise, then a walk (which keeps the heart rate elevated). It’s a little bro-science-y, but there's nothing wrong with it.

This is how i structured my day with that in mind:

* Wake up and drink coffee
* 10 min meditation
* Warm up (Tim Anderson’s rocks)
* **Easy strength + Vest squats + Vest walk**
* 15 min meditation
* Eat and get on with my day

It looks like more than it is listed out like that. In reality it would be hours after waking up that I would be doing a session, where I got on with whatever I needed to do that morning. A quick word about the meditations: normally I do a 15 min meditation after working out, it helps to dissipate the tension built from lifting weights. As this is technically a deload week, it makes sense to me to try to relax more during it, so I added another meditation before the workout. I use the app ‘1 Giant Mind’ (thank you Andy for showing me that).



**The actual workouts:**

**Easy strength** - for easy strength I picked 3 movements:

* Rack clean - 3 sets of 3 reps
* Ring push ups - 2 sets of 5 reps
* Deadhang pullups - 3 sets of 3 reps
* 10 second shoulder hang after every set

This was easy, obviously. It took an average of 7 mins and just to get some movement in before the squats. Rack cleans are just clean done within the rack, just below the knee. Feet were elevated on a bench for the ring push ups, and pullups were bodyweight only. Every single set for the whole week was trivially easy.



**Vest squats** - for a total of 5,040 squats you need to do **720** each day, so that's what I did. I wore a **14.5 kg / 32 lb** weight vest.

For the first 4 days I did 20 squats a minute on the minute for 36 minutes. The last 3 days I upped that to 22 squats, and went for 33 minutes (last set was only 16 reps). The sets used this kind of form and speed: [https://i.imgur.com/hkQ2BLf.mp4](https://i.imgur.com/hkQ2BLf.mp4)

I have several spine conditions, and that's as low as my spine bio-mechanic tells me to squat, so I get a pass.

Then as **soon** as I was done I went for a **walk**. I am lucky enough to have a beautiful field to walk around just behind my house that takes about 28 minutes to walk around. It’s got some good inclines and declines. I do live in England, so I was lightly rained on a few times.



**Diet:**

The fast periods were around 17-18 hours long, not on purpose - it just ended up that way. I don’t track calories anymore, but I estimate that I normally eat around 3,500 calories a day. The only real thing I did differently was dropping my pre-workout meal of 4 rice cakes and a hot cross bun with butter and jam. Which was roughly 600 calories. The only other thing I changed was drinking my coffee black and unsweetened, because that’s what Dan John does. **Yuck.**



**Results:**

I lost 1.6lbs (202.6 -> 201, height of 6’3). Honestly I expected to lose a little more than that, however, my lever belt fits better, my torso is leaner, and my upper ab area is more defined.

What I did NOT expect is for my legs to grow 0.5 inches (24.5 inches -> 25 inches). Now that doesn’t make a huge visual difference with legs as long as mine, but that’s rapid growth in one week. I feel my glutes have grown too, but I have no measurements to back that up.

My legs a week ago: [https://i.imgur.com/AzEfUdz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/AzEfUdz.jpg)

My legs now: [https://i.imgur.com/bxUDx26.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bxUDx26.jpg), [https://i.imgur.com/wImQ1kE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wImQ1kE.jpg)

(All measurements and photos taken unpumped)

The actual squats weren’t that challenging, I’m no stranger to hard conditioning -  in fact if you check my post history you will see a couple of conditioning E-books (book of oats vol 1 & 2) that outline the kind of conditioning I do. When you have done a 52 minute EMOM of: 2 chins, 3 push ups, & 10 squats while wearing a vest - for a total of 104 chins/156 push ups/520 vest squats, doing 720 squats in one session isn’t amazingly hard. In fact, the last few days I finished the session without being out of breath. I was however very happy to be finished on that 7th day, even though it’s quick - it's rather dull work. I listened to audiobooks from day 2 onward, which helped.

The hard bit was doing it for 7 days straight, and dealing with the soreness. Monday I was fine, Tuesday I was sore. Wednesday was the worst DOMS I have experienced in about 9 years of lifting and walking down the stairs was a harrowing experience. The soreness dissipated relatively quickly after day 3. On some of those vest walks I looked like an action figure that couldn’t bend at the knee.

Speaking of knees, surprisingly, there was no knee pain whatsoever this week. I have to point out Tim Anderson’s rocks here, which is probably the reason why.



**What’s next?**

Slotting a bastardized 2 day version of Mass Made Simple into a 6 day a week program, for a 7 week block that hopefully results in a 205 lbs SSB squat for 1 set for 50 reps.

16xxept,weightroom,"Meet Report: ""Strength Games V"": How To Come In Dead Last & Look Jacked Doing It As a Men's Lightweight (181lb Class)","Howdy redditors,

I’ve competed in another strongman competition, this time my first time as a Lightweight Male in the 181lb class.  I’ll cut to the chase and say I came in dead last and zero’d more events than I’d ever done before.  I’ve dropped 35lbs since March, and I’m still adjusting to my new body in that regard, which helped make this one of the most challenging competitions of my life.  I’m pretty excited in that regard, and thought I’d share the experience.

If you want to read about the training/nutrition leading up to it, check [here](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/)

And for video of the full comp, check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM4rfc9xAD8)

**PRE-COMP**

I ate the same breakfast I’ve been having every training day: 150g of egg whites mixed with 150g of beef bone broth with 1.5 scoops of Metabolic Drive and some powdered electrolytes.  A wild departure from my days of eating…nothing, so I could make weight, followed by some sort of sugary/fast food blitz.  I drove an uneventful 2.25 hours to the site and weighed in at 173.0 while wearing full sweats, shoes, and my strongman compression gear underneath.  

I set-up camp and actually dug into one of my meals before the first event: 4 hardboiled whole pasture raised organic eggs mashed into a paste with a serving of grassfed sour cream and 4oz (cooked) of ground venison, personally hunted and butchered by my wife’s Uncle.  Another departure from my glory days, which I’ll address next, but it was also weird being so hungry when I hadn’t done anything yet.  

**GOALS**

Since I knew I was super behind the 8-ball on this due to my bodyweight, this was going to be a different kind of comp for me: this was about personal growth.  My goals were to not eat any junk OR carbs and keep it as carnivore as possible.  Not because I felt like this was more noble, but more to simply see if I could, and how it would go.  The Metabolic Drive was the closest “exception” and I packed an emergency Finibar in case I found myself crashing, but otherwise it was just going to be that mashed egg/venison mixture, green tea and water.  

I also was going to go limited caffeine: only the stuff in the green tea.  I have a 3 week streak without energy drinks of coffee going, and I wanna see how long I can keep it going.  Again: no particular reason, just to see if I could.  In the past, I’d be about 2-3 energy drinks deep by the end of the day.  Did I “need” that?

The third goal was to not re-tear whatever it was I tore in my right knee on week 2 of “Juggeryoke”.  The first event was where I was most worried about that, since I did it on the log, but I was going to keep my eye on it all competition.

And final goal was to leave it all out there and have fun.  It’s the whole reason I signed up.

**EVENT 1: 200lb Log Clean and Press Each Rep**

I was excited about this event, since cleaning each rep is awesome and gasses competitors.  Then I got to actually handle the log we were going to use and realized this was going to be a “ WHO can get a rep” contest for the lightweights.  The log handles were STUPID far apart, like the Rogue 10”.  

First guy got the clean but no rep.  Second guy got in 2 of the grandest reps of all time with a jerk and a JPS-esque “press the log off the head” technique. 

I got set, got my head right, grabbed the log, went to clean it, felt it feel like a jillion pounds, got stuck midway, somehow through sheer force of will get it all the way to my chest…and knew that there was absolutely no way I was going to press it.  I let it crash, thinking that, if I could do better on another clean and not be so exhausted, I might be able to set up for a stronger press.  Well, that didn’t happen, and I didn’t want to re-tear my left bicep on an errant log clean, so after a few more attempts, I hung it up.  The guy after me got a jillion reps and was the clear candidate for first that day.

**EVENT 2: Max Trap Bar in 3 attempts**

I had been doing a ROM progression cycle on trap bar with 405lbs, so I knew I was good for that.  We were allowed to pick the starting weight in the rules meeting, so I asked for 400, knowing we’d go 20lb jumps from there.

The guy who also zero’d the log ended up asking for us to start with 380, and he missed that, so I knew if I got 400 I at least had a win there.  400 was grindy, but made it.  We were apparently pulling on the Eleiko Oppen bar, which was cool since it had knurl marks on the center of the handle, which made strapping in easy.  I had an issue with strapping in too far forward or backward in training and having the bar tilt.

No other MLWs went for 400, the next time one jumped in was at 460, so I went for that to match too.  460 felt WAY too damn heavy, but I pulled it.  Since we were doing “Rising Bar”, I decided to pass on 480 to allow me some recovery time, and asked for 500.  I really liked Rising bar for the strategic element of it, and it made a last man standing event tolerable.  I actually felt 500 ever so slightly start to break off the floor, but not enough to be worth chasing after.  My knee was holding up strong so far, and this was keeping it in place.

**EVENT 3: Sandbag and sled drag**

This and the 4th event are why I signed up: medleys in a competition.  I missed these so much.  Unlike previous comps, I did ZERO sandbag training to prep for this, which was for the best, because I usually end up tearing the hell out of my arms when I do that.  

I used some strongman cheating and put the sandbag on top of my feet as part of my set-up.  This gives a little bit of daylight between the floor and the bag, which allows for handholds.  I also ditched my competition shirt at this point and decided I was going to go for the Mariusz Pudzianowski/Jon Andersen Award for “Most Jacked Person at the Competition”, because if  can’t be the strongest at least I can look pretty while I lose.  You can actually hear some folks making commentary about it during this event.

The sandbag pick actually went pretty well, and the carry moved about as fast as I would expect with so minimal training.  The sled drag caught me off guard: about the only clue it was going to be so awful was watching the other competitors attempting the sled and being caught off guard.  So I went for the initial pull, realized it was going to be heavy as hell, and just leaned into it and pulled like hell, knowing that, if I ever stopped, I’d be dead.  Just like a shark.

I was surprised when I ran out of time.  I felt like I was moving at a good pace.  I had a slight technical error getting set up on the straps, and I lost a little bit of time on the bag, but ultimately I imagine I needed to move faster on the sled.

But I think this was the first time I had a sled in a comp where I didn’t fall backwards on my butt, so that’s a win.  This got me a last place finish.

**EVENT 4: Duckwalk and powerstairs**

Event was supposed to be duck walk 25’, do 3 reps of power stairs, then duckwalk it back.

Lotta dudes were struggling with those stairs, and I figured out where: those WIDE 100lb plates pretty much give you no opportunity to hinge.  I’m only 5’9, so I’m already sawed off as it is, but now that I have to take a sumo stance I was totally hosed.  

But also, you might be able to tell in the video: I about blacked out on the initial pick, and was basically jump zombie-ing forward until I went night-night.  I managed to fall forward, have the stars clear, do a quick pick and repeat.  I fell into the platform, corrected myself, and struggled futilely to get it to the platform.  But I gave it some solid effort, and loading my frame down with 100lbs over bodyweight was awesome for making every muscle in my body pop, so I got a cool facebook photo.  This, once again, got me last place.

**EVENT 5: Stone Medley**

I won’t bother listing weights and heights here, because as you saw on the video, it was a big goose egg.  This is the only event I have a bitter taste in my mouth about.  You might be able to see it in the video, but I was literally GLUED to the stone.  I applied a moderate amount of tack to myself, but the stone ITSELF was COATED in tacky from previous competitors, to the point that it was stuck to the platform.  So it didn’t matter about being strong enough to pick up the stone: I had to be strong enough to BREAK the tacky off the stone first and THEN pick it up, and then, once I got it lapped, it wasn’t going anywhere else.  With how high the platform was, my plan was to try to shoulder it, but I could never even get the momentum necessary, because it was like trying to walk through mud: each movement was about getting unstuck and then stuck again.

I realized at that point I’m a dinosaur in the sport: everyone else is using tacky shirts and stone sleeves and, in turn, has material that can help by pass the tacky issue, while I’m just applying sticky stuff to my body.  I the future, I think I’m just going to avoid tackying myself and just rely on what’s on the stone.  Zero’d here.

I will say that I got another great strongman win here: as I was standing there, bare chested and covered in tacky, another dude who was going that route was standing next to me.  He was definitely more “strongman built”.  He looked at me, there was a pause, and then he “Dude..are you, like, bodybuilding?”

I replied with “Nope: just not eating enough”.

He appreciated that.  Told me I was definitely the leanest dude there, and I said “Well at least I won that”. 

**LESSONS LEARNED**

I knew coming in this light was going to be a challenge, and it delivered.  Doing no specific training for the comp also added to that.  But, that’s really the big thing: I grew up.  Strongman isn’t my life anymore: it’s a thing I do for fun.  And that’s absolutely what happened: I had a blast and I DIDN’T have to change my life for it.  I kept training the week of the comp, went for a 3 mile walk with my family after it was done (and after having an AMAZING dinner at our favorite BBQ place where I got the biggest, fattest pork ribs I’d ever seen in my life alongside some amazing sliced brisket) and just treated this like it was an events day.  I intend to keep it this way: if a comp looks fun, I’ll sign up and have a blast.  And I got to help out some folks along the way: the guy who took second in my weight class cramped up BAD, so I gave him some of the electrolytes I brought and it totally transformed him.  I also let him use some of the goo gone and paper towels I brought for tacky removal and got him sold of WD-40.  And I got to meet a few awesome folks off reddit as well.  A dude named John (went by u/ifrankthepug back in the day) introduced himself to me: “Dude, are you MythicalStrength?  I’ve been reading your articles for 6 years!”  That was really cool, and honestly was one of the highlights of the competition.

Got to meet up with u/eric_twinge as well.  Was awesome getting to put a face to the name.

**WHAT’S NEXT**

Well, about that: I originally had a competition signed up for 14 Oct…but I just went looking for it and it’s gone: instead, having been moved to 4 Nov.  That’s a less viable date for me, and currently I’m the only person in the 181 weight class, so there’s very little incentive to go do it compared to just a hard events day at home.  I have a 5k signed up for 15 Oct, and then I go for a Disney Cruise on 16 Oct.  So now that I don’t have a competition looming, I’m probably going to do 2 more weeks of Juggeryoke with a few movement alterations leading up to the cruise and most likely do a mini-famine there so that I can absolutely eat my face off the whole time I’m cruising.  After that?  Chaos is the Plan.  But I’ll be at this weight class for the next competition, whenever that happens.",2023-10-02 14:00:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/16xxept/meet_report_strength_games_v_how_to_come_in_dead/
14jbgij,weightroom,[Program Review] Nsuns: Beware of the Dog,"For the past 6 weeks, I have ran a program I tentatively referring to as Nsuns: Beware the Dog. Essentiallly a combo of Nsuns main lift programming with the accessory selection + programming from Bromely's Bullmastiff program.

Tldr: Nsuns is a great program (ground breaking stuff, I know). By week 6, I was repping my old 1RM BUT, because of my accessory selection, it came at the expense of a lot of time and fatigue. For beginner lifters, this program is solid but not something to be taken lightly. 

**My Background**

I have done some kind of MMA training my entire life. This fell apart during COVID because pretty much all contact sports were off-limits. During this time I transitioned to powerlifting as a no contact replacement and have become a little obsessed. 

I have ran 5/3/1 templates, SBS programs, GZCL UHF and Bullmastiff. I have competed twice, both this year. 

**The Program**

I chose this program cause I absolutely adore AMRAP style progression but I didn't want to just run Bully or 5/3/1 again. I've always been vaguely interested in Nsuns but I dont like a lot of freedom with my accessories. So I just stapled the accessories from Bullmastiff at the end of my main sets.

I realise this *kind of* goes against the philosophy of Nsuns. I got the vibe this program emphasises getting lots of volume in on comp movements with some accessorise just to round out the lagging areas.

Bullmastiff's accessories are almost the opposite. Bromely gives you four tough exercises that rapidly increase in volume towards the end of each six week block or ""wave"". He does this by adding sets but keeping reps and weight the same.  So Week 1 you will do 2 sets, week 2 will be 3 sets, week 3 will be 4 sets then there is a ""volume reset"" to 3 sets on week 4. Then the progression continues again until week 6 has you doing 5 sets for each accessory. 

This meant Squat Day Week 1 looked like this:

> Squats: 70kg x 5, 77.5 x 3, 87.5 x AMRAP (6), 82.5 x 3, 77.5 x 3, 75 x 3, 70 x 5, 65 x 5, 60 x 5+

> Conventional Deadlift: 62.5 x 5, 72.5 x 5, 85 x 3, 85 x 5, 85 x 7, 85 x 4, 85 x 6, 85 x 8 

> Bulgarians: 2 x 15 per leg

> Leg Extensions: 2 x 15

> Pull ups : 2 x 5

> Free Standing Rows : 2 x 8 

This workout was quick and very manageable. I finished in about 45 mins and was mainly focusing in clean, snappy reps the entire time. 

BUT my week 6 Squat workout looked like this:

> Squats: 80kg x 5, 92.5 x 3, 102.5 x AMRAP (2), 97.5 x 3, 92.5 x 3, 85 x 3, 80 x 5, 75 x 5, 70 x 5+

> Conventional Deadlift: 72. 5 x 5, 85 x 5, 100 x 3, 100 x 5, 100 x 7, 100 x 4, 100 x 6, 100 x 8 

> Bulgarians: 5 x 15 per leg

> Leg Extensions: 5 x 15

> Pull ups : 5 x 5

> Free Standing Rows : 5 x 8 

This took 2 hours and was one of the toughest workouts of my entire life. Every set felt like survival, especially with all the accumulated fatigue from previous weeks. I had to do some crazy mental work to push through, especially on the Bulgarians. 

So yeah this program amps up quickly, much faster than you expect. And in order to handle this escalating volume, I had to eat accordingly.

**Diet**

I eat a plant based diet and try to stick to whole foods. I have some flexibility on this: I have biscuits with my tea and stuff like that. The odd time I might have take away. But I try not to be over reliant on super processed, low-nutrient food for calories and protein.

I also don't track calories or macros so all of these are estimates. 

By the end of the program, one day of eating might look like this:

- 8am: protein porridge with glass of soy milk (430 cals, 31g protein)  

- 9 am: coffee and oreos on the bus to the gym, (150 cals, 0g protein) 

- 12pm: protein shake and peanut butter sandwich (470 cals, 40g protein

- 2pm: mixed veg tossed with black beans, rice and cajun dressing (580 cals, 27g protein) 

- 7 pm: roast dinner, usually consisting of potatoes, vegetables and some kind of pan fried tofu (620 cals, 25g of protein) 

- 9pm: biscuits with tea (200 cals, 0g of protein) 

At 2450 cals a day, this might not seem like much food but it was actually a step up from what I'm used to cause I introduced my fourth ""meal"" of a shake + sandwich. There were also obviously days where I ate much more then this cause I got takeaway, had drinks etc. All these factors meant that I very gradually gained weight over the six weeks. 

**Results and Conclusion**

Squat: 102. 5kg x 1 - - > 102.5 x 2

Bench: 62.5kg x 1 - - > 65kg x 2

Deadlift: 135kg x 1 - - > 135kg x 4

Bodyweight: 65kg - - > 69kg 

Overwhelminy happy with these results. Every lift made great progress considering how short this block was. I'm trying not to not seethe over squat growing much slower than my other two comp lifts though.

This program was tough. It seriously pushed me to the edge and required serious investment of time and effort. I'm still glad I did it although I was also relieved for a break by the end of week 6. 

I am also seriously reconsidering my current method for training squat. I put in an incredible amount of effort into training squat, more so than the other lifts but it didn't really pay off. Effort and volume isn't working...I may have to try.... some carefully planned nerd shit????? 

**Would I recommend? **

If you are willing to put in the work, this program will pay it back (no surprise there, Nsuns works). It is a hard grind with accessories but it all (mostly) paid off. It also taught me a lot about mental toughness and how much volume I can really endure.",2023-06-26 08:30:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/14jbgij/program_review_nsuns_beware_of_the_dog/
141ifen,weightroom,"[Meet Report] WRPF The Pursuit Hot & Heavy Classic - Fort Collins, CO, USA (740kg @ 79.0kg | 514 DOTS- 27M)","**Background and Training**

This was my first meet, as ridiculous as that sounds. I’ve done powerlifting for around 3 years and lifting for 10+, including handling my girlfriend/fiance at two meets, but the stars never quite aligned for me to do my own meet. This year, after the USPA drama, II finally pulled the trigger and signed up for a local WRPF meet. In February, I started working with Matt Domney from Compound Performance for individual coaching. So far, it’s been an excellent experience and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend his coaching to anyone else. 

**Meet Prep**

My prep into this meet was a funky one. I had come off a super intense 20+ week chunk of training at the beginning of January 2023. During that block, I added 300lbs to my total (transitioned to untested… hence the insane progress). I was pretty burnt out and needed a break. This also coincided with ski season, and I ski ~40 days a season. With that in mind, I didn’t realllllly start following structured training until ~8 weeks out. 

At ~8 weeks out, I realized that if I was going to do this meet, it was time to buckle down and get serious--so I did. Things were going pretty well until about ~4 weeks out when a lower trap strain made low bar squats impossible. It was a major bummer, but thankfully I was able to continue deadlift and bench with minimal interruption. With lots of prehab-y movements + 2 massages I was able to start low bar squatting again ~1.5 weeks out. GF also had surgery ~2.5 weeks out, and this was a bigger interruption than I thought it would in terms of stress + sleep. Mentally, this prep was a bit of a struggle. I didn’t feel great for most of it, weights moved decently but below where I wanted. I had a lot of doubts and even considered dropping the meet on many occasions. I needed lots of reassurance but thankfully Matt and my GF were always there to provide it.

**Taper + Water Cut**

Hit final heavy workouts for squat and deadlift at just over a week out. Bench tapered a bit later. Had easy workouts on M/T/W on meet week, then completely off on T/F. I still went to the gym on both Thursday and Friday, but just did some yoga-type movements to move around. Did not touch a barbell. In hindsight, Matt absolutely nailed my peak and taper.

This was my first time water cutting and I was pretty nervous. My normal daytime weight was ~85kg / 187.5lb, so I knew it was a very doable cut. I looked at all the popular guides from reputable coaches and basically did a lazy amalgamation. Here’s roughly what I did:

* **Monday**: vaguely try to drink more water than usual. (avg weight 187.4)
* **Tuesday**: actually track 2 gallons + added sodium. Normal food intake. (Avg weight 190.9)
* **Wednesday**: 2.5 gallons, added sodium for 1st gallon, no added sodium after that. Cut carb intake in half (did not track, estimated). Cut fiber significantly as well. Dandelion root in the PM. (Avg Weight 191.3)
* **Thursday**. No water after 7am black coffee. No food other than raw walnuts, rice cakes, and peanut butter. Had ~100g of walnuts, 1 rice cake, and 30g of peanut butter. 100ml of water before bed to stave off the thirst. Dandelion root in the AM and PM. (AM weight: 185.x, PM weight before bed 181.7)
* **Friday**: Weigh in @ 9am. Was 179.8 upon waking at home. One more bathroom trip, and weighed in at 79kg / 174.1lbs on the calibrated scale. Guess our scale runs heavy? Upon weigh-in, drink 1L of gatorade with 1g added salt + 2 pop tarts. Sip another liter of water on the hour drive back home. From there I was basically eating carbs and drinking water with a pinch of salt continuously all day. The intent was to toe the line of uncomfortable and bloated but not in any real gastrointestinal distress. By the end of day, I was sitting back at 188.9 according to home scale.

Overall, my water cut went great. Thursday was predictably miserable, and I slept poorly, but not enough to truly be an issue. Next time, I’d probably track carbs more strictly. I’m good at estimating, but the peace of mind from actually knowing would be good. I would also start the water load ~12 hours earlier to be safe. I don’t think there’s any need to start much earlier than that. Recomp was also successful.

**The Meet**

This is where the nice things started—woke up on meet day feeling pretty decent. A little tired + nervous, but also weirdly at peace. I had spent so much time stressing the past several weeks that I was just ready to do the damn thing--regardless of the outcome. The hour of driving to the meet gave me a good opportunity to listen to some music and clear my head. 

Matt provided a meet day sheet that had warmups, timing, attempt selection, and everything I needed. I shared this with my GF and she handled everything from there. I had two friends that did all my loading. It was honestly perfect. I didn’t do anything except focus on lifting and feeling good. GF let me know when to start warming up, when to take my last warmup--everything. 

Once I started warming up for squats, I started feeling good. Lower trap felt the best it had since hurting it, and things were MOVING. After taking my first attempt, and seeing the video, I couldn’t help but laugh--it was so damn easy. From there, my confidence was sky-high. I let my GF call every attempt with no input from me. She was following the sheet (and knowing me as a lifter), so I knew that whatever she picked would be within my ability. I also texted with Matt all day.


**Squat**

* [242.5KG / 534.6lb](https://youtube.com/shorts/kM-SDTPj5oM?feature=share), ⚪🔴⚪: Jumped the rack command--center judge gave me a warning. Fastest this has ever moved for me
* [257.5KG / 567.7lb](https://youtube.com/shorts/ppFMx4761iY?feature=share), ⚪⚪⚪: Again, the fastest this has ever moved for me, gave me the confidence to go for my best-case 3rd attempt.
* [272.5KG / 600.7lb](https://youtube.com/shorts/LHh2DSOIOQY?feature=share), ⚪⚪⚪: Perfect attempt I think. It was hard, but I got it. Huge milestone. Was genuinely on cloud 9 after this. All the doubts melted away.

**Bench**

* [145KG / 319.7lb](https://youtube.com/shorts/ttYyKBLHKH8?feature=share), ⚪⚪⚪: Bumped my opener up 5kg which def stressed Matt a bit, but I was very confident based on warmups + how my bench strength scales. I wanted to bump my opener that way I could take smaller jumps to reach a realistic 3rd. Moved as an opener should.
* [155KG / 341.7 lb](https://youtube.com/shorts/owX05bHu6Fc?feature=share), ⚪⚪⚪: Another great attempt, felt very confident
* [162.5KG / 358.2lb,](https://youtube.com/shorts/kqjsplOCDD4?feature=share) ⚪⚪⚪: Took my top-end 3rd attempt and again was perfect for the day. Hard but confident lift.

**Deadlift**

Fatigue and stress started coming in a bit here. Deadlifts were great all prep, but I had the most questions about my ability to push the weights here. My heaviest pull all prep was a 302.5kg @ 9.5 (@8.5 if you ask my coach). Again, though, my final warmup at 265kg/585lb was just so easy that it gave me more confidence.

* [285KG / 628.3lb](https://youtube.com/shorts/oBCoUrKwEf4?feature=share), ⚪⚪⚪: Smoke. Felt great
* [305KG / 672.4lb](https://youtube.com/shorts/F327Dex7HQY?feature=share) ⚪⚪⚪:: lifetime PR, and it was RPE 8.5-9
* [317.5KG / 699.9lb \(I’m calling it 700 ok\)](https://youtube.com/shorts/zyLBYQzSVvc?feature=share), 🔴🔴🔴: Took a shot at a big lift and ran out of talent. So damn close, but techincally, wasn’t quite there. Got pulled forward and after i felt that downward motion, I knew I was done. Honestly, wasn’t even upset.

Total: 740kg / 1,631lbs

DOTS: 514

Placement: 1st and best lifter

124 all-time @ 181 (by DOTS, according to OpenPL)


**Final thoughts**

This was so much fun. All our friends showed up and cheered me on. I got so many compliments and comments of recognition from my fellow competitors. I would honestly list it among the best days of my life. It was incredibly validating to have everything go so well. All of my 3rds were in line with my best-case scenarios.

Plans for the future are to take a decent off-season and build some muscle. I was one of the smaller guys in my class, even at this local meet. My squat and deadlift are good; my bench still is by far the weakest link and should be low-hanging fruit to improve. Similarly, I think my pull has some technical limitations that become more apparent at the top end. That 700 should have been mine. It's not acceptable to have performance fall apart that quickly from 672 to 700. I think 82.5/83kg is the right class for me, and given that I weighed in at 79.0kg… I have room to grow. Haven’t had my post-meet call with Matt yet, but we’ll see what makes sense! 

Very proud of myself for pushing through prep and performing the way I did on meet day. I was so locked in all day. There were a number of small annoyances about the meet that I’ll list below. Hopefully, the WRPF can continue improving on the local level:

* Meet registration said squat bar would be used for squats over 200kg. So… I made a point of training with the squat bar the last several weeks of prep. Well, they didn’t use the squat bar for my flight. I guess because not everyone in the flight was squatting over 200kg? 
* On the note of flights, rather than organizing flights by opener, they did them by weight class. This meant that in the same flight of 12 people, there was a 92.5kg and 300kg deadlift 3rd attempt. Why? Slower meet and more work for the spotters.
* The gym the meet was held in was great, but, also had some issues for warmups. There were no deadlift bars for warmups. For squats, I had a Rep Sabre bar + bumper plates. Over 200kg, it was an absolute noodle with no knurling. There weren’t enough ‘real’ power bars and steel plates for everyone, or even most people to warm up on. Genuinely not trying to be a princess, but [this is kinda rough for warmup equipment at a powerlifting meet](https://youtube.com/shorts/mE6MQAoqoqg?feature=share).
* To be clear, this was a local meet, I’m not expecting a flawless experience with unlimited competition equipment for warmups. Additionally, I’m used to training on all manner of equipment, none of this threw me off. But, worth mentioning. It should have been better, and I will prioritize that for future meets.
* Officiating was consistent and fair. Everyone running the meet was friendly and accessible. No complaints here.",2023-06-05 15:36:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/141ifen/meet_report_wrpf_the_pursuit_hot_heavy_classic/
13lwj73,weightroom,Program Review: 2 Blocks of Building the Monolith,"**TL;DR** - I ran Building the Monolith as a Leader 2x, with an Anchor of PR Set and FSL sandwiched in. The first run went great! The second was less great

**Background:** I am 28/M/6'0"" I’ve been lifting consistently for just over 2 years. I’ve never considered myself strong or particularly muscular, and honestly still don’t, but I thought my experience might be valuable.

Building the Monolith is designed to make you monolithic. It’s (one of) Wendler’s answers to folks looking to get bigger.

**Changes to the Program:**
I Followed Wendler's recommendations that you do conditioning, but my main forms of conditioning were running, the elliptical, sled pushes, and kettlebells. No access to an assault bike so couldn’t do Jim’s recommended Day 6 conditioning workout. I did not follow the diet. I use MacroFactor and allowed robo-Greg to tell me how much to eat. I also sometimes ignored MF and just ate what I wanted, leading to a faster rate of gain than was necessary 

**Running the Program:**
My typical week looked like this:

* Sunday: Day 1 lifting, 90ish minutes in the gym
* Monday: 10 rounds of Armor-Builders, 1.5 mi run
* Tuesday: Day 2 lifting, sub 1-hr in the gym
* Wednesday: sled pushing/ humane burpees/ or run
* Thursday: Day 3 lifting, hr-ish in the gym
* Friday: 20 mins of elliptical or run
* Saturday: blessed day of rest

I ran everything at a confirmed 85% TM to start (5-6RM), and took jumps from there. I could not maintain the normal 10/5 jumps at the end, and was probably closer to a 90% TM after the Anchor. In hindsight I should have lowered the TMs further for the second go-round. This program really does not play nice with a too high TM

**Some thoughts on the program itself:**

* 100 chins was my white whale. I came into this with a max set of chins being ~8 at a BW of 188.6 The first Day 1 I started out doing triples and got the last few reps as singles. By the end I was doing sets of 5 for all 100 chins. I feel really great about my chin improvement even as BW came up.
* 5x5 LSL squats are murder if your Training Max is too high. I got buried a few times when my recovery was not on point and had to option down on a few of the sets. 
* My dips did not get better on this program, but my press exploded.
* This program really taught me what conditioning in 531 can look like. You can push it a lot more than you think.
* Conditioning is mando. I did a really good job of it for the first 6 week block, and a less good job of it in the second block (take a look at my expenditure and weight graphs to see the inflection point for this). I think that directly ties to my good results in the first block and less good results in the second block.


**Diet:**
Robo-Greg, aka MacroFactor, tells me what to eat these days. Only supplements were 5g of creatine daily and the caffeine present in my coffee. 80%+ of my nutrition were whole foods I made into meals myself. Think overnight oats with peanut butter for breakfast, beans/lentils with meat and cheese for lunch, or a bagel with cream cheese for a late night snack. The big spikes in cals consumed you’re seeing are from the times I chose fun foods out.

**Results and Progress Made:**
The lifts are my TM/best sets performed during the program. The weights are in lbs. While this progress might look a little underwhelming for some people, keep in mind that every single starting number was a lifetime PR at the time, and every finishing number (except dips) is a lifetime PR.

I also completed 17 rounds of ABCs in 5’ with 40# KBs for the kettleballs April challenge. This is great considering last year 20’ of EMOM ABCs I considered hard, near max effort conditioning.

I don’t have good before pics unfortunately, but suffice to say that people in my life have started to notice some size on my arms, back, and legs. Also my clothes have changed from being snug at the waist and loose in the thighs/shoulders to snug in the thighs/shoulders and loose at the waist, despite being up in BW.

**Conclusion:**
The goal was to get bigger and I succeeded. I honestly could have eaten slightly less, or perhaps conditioned a little harder, as I’m kinda forced to be done bulking now. I’ve added size all over, but I’m not willing to keep going as my waistline is about as wide as I’m comfortable with, and I’m honestly tired of all the cooking and eating. BtM remains a great, highly recommendable program. But probably do it once then move on to something else. I was a little bit beat up for the second run, and my willingness to keep the conditioning up just wasn’t there. Bulking is exhausting work, and doing a minicut anchor in between runs didn’t actually let me recover appropriately to give the second block 100% effort.",2023-05-19 14:10:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13lwj73/program_review_2_blocks_of_building_the_monolith/
11up05s,weightroom,[Program Review] Push It Until It Breaks: SuperSquats While Running 50 Miles Per Week,"**DISCLAIMER:**

If you attempt to do this, God help you. But if you do, hit me up so we can talk about it.

**INTRO/TRAINING HISTORY:**

I am a long distance runner turned lifter. I have competed in dozens of half marathons, marathons, and ultramarathons. In October 2022, I [placed 1st in the END-TRAILS 6HR Ultra](https://reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/yhpo5w/extreme_north_dakota_terrifying_run_amongst/), and in December 2022, I [placed 3rd in the Tinajas Double Marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/zcaqa2/tinajas_double_marathon/). In regards to lifting, I've followed countless programs in the past, including multiple iterations of Building the Monolith (one of which included an absurd amount of extra volume, outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/u08u6q/program_review_jim_wendlers_building_the_monolith/)), and multiple iterations of Deep Water Beginner (one of which also included completing the Murph WOD everyday, outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/wzvsgf/program_review_jon_andersons_deep_water_beginner/)). I've also followed some challenges, such as Dan John's 10,000 Kettlebell Swing Challenge. 

**BACKGROUND:** 

Leading up to this monstrosity of a program, I recently finished the Ultramarathons above, and was a little lost in regards to training. I have always been a runner first - and while I go through periods of placing running on the backburner, I can never shift the needle entirely. As many of you know from my comments and previous posts, I am an active duty service member, and in January, my unit deployed overseas. This left me with nothing but time and three priorities: my job, my fitness, and my wife back home. I found myself putting in \~50 miles and 3-4 lifting sessions a week fairly regularly. Concurrently, r/gainit was participating in the SuperSquats program party. This is what planted the seed for the most intense six weeks of my life.

**THE PROGRAM:**

For reference, I am a 5'10 male, approximately 165lb, and since I had already become accustomed to running the 50mi/week, I was too stubborn to abandon such a pretty number. I squatted on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and ran pretty much whenever I had the time. On most weeks, I would aim to have all the miles finished by Saturday, in an attempt to have one day off of full recovery. This did not always happen. The typical weekly schedule looked like this:

\- Monday: 10 miles.

\- Tuesday: AM SuperSquats, 9miles in the evening.

\- Wednesday: 10 miles

\- Thursday: AM SuperSquats, 8 miles in the evening.

\- Friday: 8 miles

\- Saturday: AM SuperSquats, 5 miles directly after.

\- Sunday: Recovery. Typically walk around 7-8 miles.

For the first four weeks, I followed an A-B workout scheme for SuperSquats. I did the pullovers, but I stole the A and B accessory work from the accessory work for Building the Monolith. I'm sorry Randall - BtM still has my heart. However, starting in Week 5, recovery became a real issue (more on that below), and I switched over to some easier accessory work - 100 reps of push and pull, and 50 of core, every workout day. For the running, I ran at whatever pace I felt like. I incorporated speed work one or two times per week, but the overwhelming majority was zone two cardio. For those interested in the running details and/or proof, [here is my Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/48966307). And a note on the running - all but three of the runs were done on a treadmill due to weather conditions and convenience. 

**NUTRITION/RECOVERY:**

For the first couple weeks, I ate like somewhat of a sane human being. I do not track my calories, but I would estimate I was somewhere in the range of 3,500 calories per day. As the program went on, I would guess I finished around 4,000 calories per day, maybe more. My goal for nutrition was simple: I need to eat enough food to recover in the gym and fuel the runs. Keep in mind we eat in a dining facility, so meals were fairly flexible and based on what they were serving for any given meal. A typical day of eating in Week 6 looked like this:

\- 0500: Optimum Nutrition Protein Bar covered in peanut butter

\- 0745: 2 scoops of whey, 6 hard-boiled eggs, 2 pieces of toast with jam, coffee

\-0930: Fruit with two heaping scoops of peanut butter

\-1200: 8OZ chicken/beef/pork, 2 cups of rice, 2 cups of mixed vegetables, 1 cup of soup, 2-3 cups of salad with dressing.

\-1430:  Fruit with two heaping scoops of peanut butter

\-1700: Same as 1200 meal

\-1930: 2 servings of peanut-butter pretzels and 2 handfuls of mixed nuts.

As I mentioned above, recovery become a very real issue starting in Week 5. Despite all the calories, the wheels were starting to fall off, and I could feel it. I started to get pretty serious pains in my left foot, my knees hurt, and my hip adductors and abductors were brutally sore. I was sleeping 7-8 hours per night, but I'd often wake up in the middle of the night with night sweats. Mentally, I was exhausted. I experienced a sense of scheduling anxiety with my last run of Deep Water, but this was another level. The entire day revolved around training and eating.

However, despite these issues, I completed SuperSquats without missing a single rep, and I finished all weeks with 50 total running miles.

**MY RESULTS/EXPERIENCE/THOUGHTS:**

**-** This is my version of u/MythicalStrength's idea of ""Push it until it breaks"". This is, for now, absolutely my upper boundary when it comes to pushing the limits of lifting and running concurrently. I came into this knowing I could throw everything at my training and seeing what happened. 

\- I currently live, eat, train, and run in a tent. I do not have a bodyweight scale. I have no idea how much weight I gained. That said, my legs are noticeable thicker, my traps and upper back muscles are more developed, and my core is blockier. I'm sure I accumulated some additional weight around the hips, but now that I can stop eating a grocery store daily, I'm sure that'll slide off in the coming weeks.

\- I'm excited to see how this high-rep strength carries over to lower rep, higher intensity work in the coming weeks.

\- For the squats, I switched up how I counted the reps almost every session. I have no idea why. Probably some sort of coping mechanism. For the final workout, I counted: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1.

\- The last time I did any sort widowmaker squats was for my second cycle of BtM, which was April 2022. I finished week six with 225x20. I finished SuperSquats with 270x20.

\- I'd like to run SuperSquats again in the future now that I've done 270x20. I know I still have a long way to go, but I can't get 315x20 out of my head. I know it's far away, but in my head it's attainable.

\- Most of the running was done while listening to audiobooks or podcasts. I actually really enjoyed the solitude most days. 

\- For the first couple weeks, I think the running actually REDUCED the soreness. After the halfway point, I think it contributed to it.

**WHAT'S NEXT?**

Starting on the 27th, I'm going to dive into BBB Beefcake for a couple of cycles and drop my running down to a less time-consuming weekly distance. I'd like to reintroduce some kind of WOD-style conditioning as well.

For now, though, I'm going to have a Kvass and relax. As always, happy to answer any comments or questions.",2023-03-18 13:49:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/11up05s/program_review_push_it_until_it_breaks/

No, not those PEDs, the [Pressing Every Day system](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rkmv1r/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_benching/) silly! I apologize for the clickbait. 

 

History

 

28 yo male, 5'10”, 185 lbs at the start of the program. 

 

2009 through 2013, I was a cross country and distance track runner, weighing in at about 145 lbs at my heaviest, and with programless lifting I managed a pr of 345lb high handle trap bar deadlift, and also gave myself an inguinal hernia. Oops. My speed capped at 17:36 across 2.9 miles and a 12:12 3200 on the track. 2014-2019, I stopped running and lifting and fattened up to 190 lbs on zero exercise and 100% Ben and Jerry's Half Baked. I lived sedentarily like this til 2020, where I used Tactical Barbell to prep for Mammoth Sniper Challenge 2021, all exercise in the form of rucking, occasional running, and Tactical Barbell SE work. [This is the base I had doing into Super Squats where I gained up to a peak of 202 lbs. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/w2g1qs/program_review_super_squats_as_run_by_a_novice/)

 

After that I did a little 531 and running and hurt myself. The aftermath and recovery is spelled out in my [writeup of The Morning StArmstrong: 5K edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/10nf5ni/program_reviews_531_the_morning_star_and_the/). 

 

What I wanted:

 

My primary goals were to bump an ego lift with the clean and press, bump my pullups/chinups, get faster on runs, and plank for longer. I wanted to lose weight if possible to ease my pullups/plank/run.

 

The Program

 

This is what overreaching looks like. I was going to do the [Armstrong Pullup Program](https://armstrongpullupprogram.com/), /u/dadliftsnruns’ [Pressing Every Day system (focused on pressing overhead)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/rkmv1r/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_benching/), do Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday running following the standard “one tempo run, one interval run, one long run” format as programmed by Run with Hal. I would phase in planks every other day as I approached my PFT date.

 

Modifications

 

""No program survives first contact with a novice"" -Sun Tzu, probably

 

Armstrong was run with chin-ups instead of pullups. This means that 4 days out of the week, I’d do chin-ups, with the exception of the day with wide grip pullups, normal grip pullups, and grip-touching chins on Wednesday which was done per his recommendation. Fridays were always day 1’s 5 max effort AMRAP’s. I did not do the pushups that were recommended this cycle.

 

PEDs was changed from bench press to overhead press. Assistance lifts were the behind the neck press, Z press, axle press, and gorilla glute press, with the thruster for overload. ***It was also dropped after 3 weeks when I realized how untenable 3 separate programs would be given my current recovery capabilities and willingness to gain/eat through the fatigue.***

 

Diet

 

My diet was calorically uncontrolled, just going on what felt right. Here's a sample food day:

 

Morning coffee with 2 scoops of protein powder plus creamer and 5g creatine. 

 

.8-1.25 lbs of crock pot pork or beef for lunch

 

One large bag of steam-in-bag frozen veggies an hour or two later

 

Pre/Periworkout Gatorade, mixed from powder, 1-2L

 

6 cage free eggs and a multivitamin for dinner

 

Occasionally, a large bowl of mini wheats with whole milk. I'm a sucker for it. 

 

More food might’ve helped my recovery, but I needed to stave off weight gain.

 

Results

 

Press jumped to 2 at 123lbs. Stoked.

 

Chin ups climbed from 12 to 15 unbroken. Stoked.

 

Planked for 3 minutes and 45 seconds (max score, just after AMRAP pullups). Stoked.

 

Run speed stayed the same at 23 minutes across 3 miles. Bummer.

 

“You look way better than you did last [Test].” Window Dressing, still stoked.

 

Bodyweight dropped a bit to 182 the morning of my test.

 

What I liked

 

The Armstrong Program still delivers. If you’re trying to get more than ~10 pullups, do this program. For bonus points, do every day (except for day 1 if you’re doing them as a tested lift, do those like you’d do the test) with Renaissance Periodization style slow, deep stretch pullups/chin-ups. Your ladder and Training sets will be small sets, but you’ll impress people with the strength of your reps when you hit the bar. Make them count in training and the test will be easy. I think alternating between pullups and chin-ups every few weeks will be beneficial for the trainee.

 

PEDs is sweet for guys who want to do a lot of the same lift and just drive it through the moon with practice, but it should be THE program you’re running, you can’t tack it on after other priorities and do well. When I can return to a focus on the press, I will use this.

 

Run with Hal still takes all the thinking out of running programming which is nice. It might be better to think a little bit.

 

What I didn’t like:

 

Run With Hal didn’t deliver what I wanted. Might’ve been a skill issue, but I don’t think the low mileage of 12-17 miles a week did enough for my aerobic condition to make the speedwork pay off. I can run 90 second 400’s without TOO much issue. I just can’t do them without much rest, which tells me my lungs and heart aren’t developed enough.

 

What I'd do differently:

 

DON’T COMBINE 3 SEPARATE PROGRAMS! FIND A PROGRAM THAT WILL COVER EVERY BASE YOU WANT TO COVER!

 

I am moving away from Run with Hal back to Tactical Barbell, with the focus on more mileage. I need to know what the end state looks like, and see progression towards that goal.

 

Start planking sooner, ideally throughout the training block. It can be thrown after the pullup work without much issue, or after your pushups if you’re doing the morning pushups.

 

In Conclusion:

 

Armstrong is still sweet.

 

PEDs is sweet if you’re not dumb

 

Run with Hal fell off my recommendations list. I don’t think it’s suitable for combining several domains of training, and it’s not actually that clear how to pick a plan that will meet your needs. Because you can only see about 10 days in advance things like monthly deloads are not really in the cards.

 

Moving forward:

 

I desperately need to build a bigger aerobic base and prep for long trail runs, want to sustain my pullups, and should build some work capacity and strength. I plan to use Tactical Barbell: Green Protocol’s Hybrid or Velocity templates to do this. Lifts will be weighted pullups, press/row supersets, deadlifts, then a quick no-rest SE superset/complex of bodyweight pullups into planks. I will do at least 4 days of running every week, with only 1 of those being a speed/hill day. I also want to start doing more ringwork to build towards muscle ups but that’s DEFINITELY window dressing.",2023-03-17 18:36:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/11tzmhd/program_review_run_with_halthe_armstrong_pullup/

I lived sedentarily like this til 25, started intermittent exercise in the form of rucking, occasional running, and Tactical Barbell SE work. 

I also ran Super Squats. 

Between super squats and now I've been juggling my running and pullups, but wanted to return to 531 proper for some gpp. I did so and hurt my knee. Whoops. 

What I wanted:

My primary goals were to lay some groundwork for an ego lift with the clean and press, bump my pullups, add some pushups to my total, rehab my knee that started locking up on runs, and develop whole back pulling power. I did not want to gain or lose weight to avoid having to cut lots or stunt my healing, so I could return to 5k training and general PFT prep. 

The Program

Wendler wrote a 531 Forever program for a guy who wanted to clean, press, and squat a lot. Naturally, like all programs in 531 Forever, it includes daily push, pull, and single leg/core work, plus jumps and throws. He called this The Morning Star. I abbreviated it to 1 leader, 1 anchor from the written 2 leader, 1 anchor recommendation. This is the only template I know of that calls for reps at your TM which is cool. 

Modifications

""No program survives first contact with a novice"" -Sun Tzu, probably

I modified the program by adding the Armstrong Pullup Program to it! 

Armstrong is simple, available free online, and covers both the push and pull assistance required by Wendler, by requiring daily pullups and recommending daily pushups. 

Because I wanted to add weighted pullups to the progression, I took the heavier 531 progression from 531 2nd edition and applied it to the pullups to replace day 5's ""do whatever was hardest"" recommendation. If you can strap ~40% of your body weight to you and do one pullup you can do this too. 

I did minimal core work, against the plan. 

I changed squats to front squats to build some upper back strength and front rack familiarity. 

Press became Axle Press because I was familiar with the movement and pressing an axle feels cool. All sets were taken from the floor. 

All training maxes were set at 80%, instead of the recommended 90%, except for weighted pullups. 

The program was run 351 instead of 531.

I did no jumps or throws for lack of venue. 

Conditioning was running, phased-in as my knee allowed. 2 weeks without running, 2 weeks with 1 run weekly, 2 weeks with 2 runs. Runs were a Tuesday speed work day and a Saturday long run. 

Diet

My diet was calorically uncontrolled, just going on what felt right. Here's a sample food day:

Morning coffee with 2 scoops of protein powder

.8-1.25 lbs of crock pot pork or beef for lunch

One large bag of steam-in-bag frozen veggies an hour or two later

Periworkout Gatorade, mixed from powder, 1L

A bowl of Costco Tonkatsu ramen with 3-4 cage free eggs

Occasionally, a large bowl of mini wheats with whole milk. I'm a sucker for it. 

Results

Axle Press PR returned to 130lb e1RM, approximately 20 pounds lighter bodyweight than last time, approximately a 20 pound jump. Stoked

On my last day I set a 3@118lb barbell press PR, matching that e1RM despite having not pressed a barbell overhead for a max ever. Stoked

Pullups jumped from 11 to 13 overhand. Stoked

Pushups climbed from 20 to 40 without stopping. Nice

My final PR attempt at front squats saw me do 8@178lb, which is a big bump in e1RM over my previous best of 2@198 also set 20lb heavier. I had more in the tank for sure. Nice

Cleans went from a very messy 3@123 to a much less ugly 5@128, with much more confidence to clean the barbell for pressing now. Nice

Bodyweight grew to 185. Meh

Aesthetically I noticed the pulling and pressing gave me real aesthetic gains in my back and shoulders. Pullups build great lats. 

What I liked

The Morning Star is sweet. If you're the type of guy that hates doing the same lifts every day it's not for you, but I really enjoy that 3x weekly frequency. Because you're doing mainwork, 5x5's, and 10x5's every week in the leader you're getting lots of volume in, but it's all laid out manageably. The Anchor cycle sets you up to hit 9 successive PR's if all goes to plan. 

The Armstrong Program delivers. I've never really done pushups with any serious effort so the gains there are nice, but the pullups are the purpose and they went up despite gaining a couple pounds. 

What I didn’t like:

My choices of assistance (pushups and pullups only) meant I got little rowing in, and some kind of dip work would've been nice to balance all the pushing and pulling in other directions. You'll note that this is a me problem.

Cutting the second leader cycle meant lower TM's for my PR cycle and less volume accumulated, so there were definitely gains to be had there. Once again, me problem. 

What I'd do differently:

I think next time I run this, it'll be with 3x weekly weighted pullups in line with Tactical Barbell Operator plus either dips or gorilla glute press as my equipment allows. Banging out a pullup ladder then going for speed work isn't fun, I'd rather divorce them, but results are results. 

In Conclusion:

The Morning Star is sweet, and I'll run it again.

Armstrong is sweet and I'm running it again after a deload week. 

Moving forward:

I feel mostly ready for my next block which is clean and pressing every day, pullups every day, planks every day, and running/rucking every day for PFT prep and weight loss. Hoping for a 250+ PFT, which 4-8 weeks of specific conditioning and weight loss should enable.",2023-01-28 13:31:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/10nf5ni/program_reviews_531_the_morning_star_and_the/
ytws1h,weightroom,"Meet Report: ABPU South Yorkshire Qualifier. Masters 1, 480kg at 89.1kg, 311 DOTS","  TL:DR: 6/9, didn’t PB any lifts. Kinda disappointed in myself but proud I did the thing. 

**Introduction**

This is my fourth meet and the first one where I get to use a powerlifting cliché in my IG caption: this wasn’t the meet I wanted. 

My previous meets were October 2019 (345 @ 84kg), August 2021 (425kg @ 88kg), March 2022 (495kg @ 94kg in wraps). My last meet in March was my first one with the ABPU and this was my second. For those of you who are not up-to-date with UK federations, the ABPU is affiliated with the A/WPC. Amateur British Powerlifting Union is the tested federation, while the BPU is the untested federation. As an ABPU member I don’t compete against members of the BPU, but I compete on the same platform as them. This fed allows wraps for squats and uses a monolift, a squat bar and a deadlift bar. It also has 24 hours weigh-ins, and this was my first time takin advantage of the longer weigh-in. 

**Meet Prep / making weight / weigh-in**

I have recently written up a programme review of my meet prep so I won’t go into it too deeply. 

Briefly, I ran Alex Bromley’s Bullmastiff programme, which is freely available as a PDF on his website. I made a couple of changes to make it a bit better for powerlifting. However, as explained in my programme review, I don’t think it actually worked that well for me to peak into this meet so I felt I came in less prepared as I did in previous meets. 

My best singles in prep were a 175kg squat, a 105kg bench (I also hit 110kg but it was ‘assisted’) and a 200kg Deadlift. Previous Meet PBs are 180/110/205. I did feel based on this squat that I was in sight of a PB, and I made the decision to fuck around/find out for the other two lifts. 

For whatever reason, my anxiety during the taper week was worse than previous as regular posters in the r/weightroom daily threads will attest. I think feeling a little bit like I’d ‘failed’ my prep didn’t help at all with that. I ended up laying out and packing all my kit on the Thursday before the meet, just to be doing something about it. It helped but bloody hell taper week is a nightmare. 

I had been weighing 90-91kg the week previous to taper week so I knew I needed to drop a little to come in as a -90kg. I switched my calorie intake on Macrofactor to maintenance and ate low residue foods from the Monday (where I weighed 90.6kg), then restricted water to 15ml/kg and calories for the 24 hours before weigh-in on Friday. I woke up Friday morning at 88.7kg, so that was successful. I even allowed myself a little coffee on the hour drive down. 

Weigh-in was slightly problematic. The WPC worlds were last week in Florida and I believe Florida has had an issue with a hurricane or two recently. It took the BPU president and her husband 40 hours to get back, so they slept through their alarm on Friday and turned up 45 minutes late for weigh-in. I was HANGRY. 

Regardless, they were as apologetic as you can be for this sort of slip-up. Let the person who has not slept through their alarm cast the first stone. 

Weighed in at 89.1kg. Rehydrated and refueled on the drive home. The biggest problem with a late weigh-in was that I missed Maccas breakfast so I couldn’t smash down many, many hash browns. My anxiety lessened significantly at this point. Went home, ate a lot. Went to bed early. 

**Meet Day**

This was the first time this meet had hosted a powerlifting meet and it kinda showed. One Monolift, one power rack and one competition bench aren’t enough for two flights of 15 lifters to warm up in, sorry. Bench was particularly problematic; I ended up doing all but my last single on a low, wide, commercial bench. 

We made it work – I managed to get all my timings right for once. Last time I competed ABPU I really shagged my squat warm-ups by forgetting that it was a 25kg bar and I was ready to go 15 minutes before the flight started. This time I squatted my last warmup with 7 minutes to go and got round to the desk ready to go. I was squatting 4th in my flight. 

**Squats**

**Attempt 1. 160kg, Make.** My writing is terrible, I had put 165kg as my opener but I guess they couldn’t read it. I also discovered as I walked onto the platform that WPC/BPU have banned headbands, which as a sweaty, bald man I take as a personal affront. Anyway, I sunk it. 

**Attempt 2. 175kg, Make.** Biggest jump I’ve ever made on squats. Turns out that I either set up differently or the weight on my back made me about 1cm shorter, as the mono arms could not swing out of the way. Had to reset, get the rack height dropped one hole and then go again. I then proceeded to squat the ugliest single I have ever done. It really threw me and so I didn’t take as big a jump as I had planned

**Attempt 3 180kg, Make.** Only went up 5kg. Based on the video my brother showed me of the second squat I thought it was the right decision. I then went out and squatted 180kg like it was a breeze. Equal PB which I am pleased about especially being 5kg lighter than last time. But I am gutted that I didn’t just go for 185kg.

**Bench Press**

**Attempt 1. 100kg, Make.** As noted in my BM review, my bench has sucked for months. This 100kg was fine, moved nicely. 

**Attempt 2. 105kg, Miss.** The fuck? I missed this where I always miss bench – midway up. I just can’t grind past that point. IDK what was up with this, I honestly thought 105kg was a weight I can hit 98% of the time. Obviously today was that 2%

**Attempt 3. 105kg, Miss**. Bench is dumb.

At this point I knew I was deeply buggered for getting the M1 qualifying total for British Nationals of 510kg. It was always a bit of a long shot but now really, really out of reach. 

**Deadlifts**

**Attempt 1. 190kg, Make.** Warm-ups had sucked a bit but not enough to change my opener down. I accidentally inhaled so much ammonia that I thought I was going to be sick walking out onto the platform. Obsidian know what they are doing. 

**Attempt 2. 200kg, Make.** Did the too much ammonia trick again. Honestly, this lift felt hard. I really was tired by this point and kinda done with the meet. I got my first ever 2 to 1 judges decision on this lift – before this I had either got all whites or all reds. One of the side judge’s felt I had lowered the bar too fast, fair enough. 

**Attempt 3.** **210kg, Miss.** YOLO. This would have been a PB but I couldn’t get it past my knees. I kinda gave up on it as well.

**Conclusions / learnings**

So there we have it. 6/9, 480kg total, no PBs. I won the M1 ABPU -90kg category by default, I think I would have been 2nd and last in the open as well. 

I don’t want to make excuses. I was not strong enough on the day to achieve what I wanted – I started this prep thinking I had a really good chance of getting the qualifying total of 510kg for M1 u90kg, then adjusted to thinking I had a chance of getting a 500kg total, and then ended just wanting to get it done. 

Everyone is eventually going to have a bad meet eventually. This was my first bad one, I am sure that I’ll have some more. But, and I cannot stress this enough, I had an absolute blast; the highs of just being in the room are amazing. You’re a part of every lift. I have yet to have an unfriendly interaction with anyone at a meet and I love meeting a really diverse range of people at every meet. 

I have a few big learning points from this meet. 

The first is that I really need to sort my bench press out. It is by far my weakest lift and I have suspicions it’s a technical fault somewhere. I also need to get much bigger in the upper body; more muscle is always nice. 

I absolutely should not be competing at u90kg, I think it’s too light for me. If I wanna get stronger I need to spend the next 6 months at least bulking and lifting really, really hard.  

I also need to work on my mental game. I shouldn’t have been thrown as much as I was by having to reset a squat. I had plenty of time and one good thing about the ABPU is that the minute for your attempt can stretch some. I was so wildly anxious going into this meet and that influenced how I felt on the day. Having said that, I have to remember that lifting is part of my stress relief process and competition is only a fun side-effect. I know that I’m never going to be a spectacular lifter and to be honest I’d rather still be competing at 65 than burning out in three years. 

So I think I am going to knock competing on the head until this time next year and really just work on ~~burying my feelings in my muscles~~ getting bigger. 

Perhaps the best part of yesterday was getting home, eating a giant Chinese takeaway and then getting slept on [by my dog](https://imgur.com/a/EyeNTHt)

vlebsv,weightroom,Happy Deadlifts- My Road to USS Nationals WHW 198-,"This was my third strongman competition, first Nationals, and the biggest competition I've ever done in any sport.

**The Lifts:**

All on IG. I put the link in the post.

**The Results:**

I tied for 4th out of 11 women. I missed the podium by .5 a point (the stones are the great equalizer), and I had the best deadlift of all the women (by dots) and the second largest deadlift overall at 520lbs.

**The Journey:**

I won my first show in October (HW Novice- Battle of the Belles) and qualified for Nationals. About a month or so later, I decided to sign up and then I did a show in April (HW Lift for Autism) as a bit of a litmus test for Nationals as it had similar events (keg press for reps, farmers carry w/ the Nationals weight). I won that show too, but I was the only woman in my weight class, so well a participation trophy, but I didn't zero in anything.

Right after the October show, I did a lot of bodybuilding work, John Meadows Warlock and Grandmaster, as my arms and shoulders were small and that's not good for Strongman.

From there, I did Simple Jack'd and Easy Strength to get ready for the April Show and the Nationals. I did events training on the weekends, and was trying to drastically improve my overhead strength, take whatever deadlift gains I could get, and try to learn how to do the events- prep for the Iron Cross was ugly and I went from an 110lb stone to shoulder to a 200lb stone to shoulder in training.

The flights were a bit of a mess. My initial flight to NH was cancelled so I had to take an earlier one and miss a day of work.

My return flight was cancelled, so I had to drive to Boston and fly out from there.

But I did make it there and home.

**Weigh in:**

I was feeling pretty good about my weight. I averaged around 195, so I just dropped carbs on Wednesday + Thursday and weighed in at 192.8. This turned out to be pretty important because I won the deadlift by a very small margin, I think it was a fraction of a Dot point, so I'm very glad I skipped the cookie they gave me when I checked in at the Hotel.

**Competition Day:**

Lots of nervous energy. I couldn't really eat much, had a kind bar and come coffee cake. Everything else was Gatorade, Pedialyte, and a little caffeine.

First Event: Press Medley 125lb Sandbag, 150lb keg, 150lb sandbag.

This was disappointing. I lost my balance on the first bag, had to redo it, and then I was too gassed for the keg. I kept getting it towards my shoulder, but I couldn't get the drive to get it overhead.

Many of us didn't finish the medley. The overall winner crushed it. I have to get stronger and more comfortable pressing unstable things.

Second Event: Deadlift- My bread and butter! I honestly would have been happy to come in dead last if I pulled 500lbs.

This was a last man standing on the Mammoth bar. Started at 380 which was still a warmup to me, but my press is shit, so I have to brag here.

We started with a big line as the 181s, 198s and the SHW women all went together but women dropped off quick!

I had trouble figuring out when I was going, so I just hovered and would say my name every time to make sure it was my turn to go.

I was channeling my Ronnie Coleman, ""Lightweight Baby,"" up through 500lbs (which was my goal for 2022, so that was cool). 520 was the first one that felt heavy and the 540 was a minute later as there were only two women standing at this point. I couldn't budge it. 520 was a 40lb lifetime PR for me, so I was happy as a pig in mud!

Third Event: Iron Cross- This was brutal. 240lbs. Some women couldn't get over the line. I had a pretty good 25ft run, but the thought of turning around, nah!. I put it down before I fell and hurt myself. I never did more than 170 in training, so I was pretty content.

Fourth Event: Farmers Hold- 180lbs hand. This hurt like a mother. I don't know how such a boring event can be so painful. My triceps felt like they were going to tear off my arm. I dropped it just shy of a minute, just happy I didn't break my foot lol!

Fifth Event: Stones to Shoulder 200lbs. So close. I tried 3 times. The first two weren't high enough. The third rolled off the top of my shoulder. I just didn't have any more gas. My back was too tired to bend the way I needed it to. Just got to get stronger and more ""flexible, mobile? something."" Most women zeroed this. One woman got her way onto the podium just by getting 1 rep. The girl I was tied with also zeroed, so we got 4th together :D

After it was all over, I was ready to go to the hotel and pass out and that's when one of the officials came up to me, told me I won the deadlift, and I opted for the cash prize instead of the Mammoth bar. The gym I train at already has one, and I don't have plates, so no reason to bring it home.

That made my day. I'm still feeling myself. I had a lot of fun. Met some kickass lifters and I know exactly what weak points I need to shore up for future events.

I also want to get on the powerlifting platform next year and hit 500lbs w/o straps. That would be sick!",2022-06-26 21:00:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/vlebsv/happy_deadlifts_my_road_to_uss_nationals_whw_198/
tqylen,weightroom,Making Dieting Easy: BiteyMax’s Guide to Weight Loss,"38 Years old, Male

5’7”, Currently 179lbs

Training for 6 Years

Office Job



This guide will outline 2 large weight cuts I’ve done in the past 6 years and how I implemented my lessons learned from the first cut during the second one.

**Diet 1 :**

Starting Weight:  218

End Weight: 168


Upon starting this diet, I had no knowledge at all as to how to properly diet or handle exercising to lose weight.  It was done exactly how you would expect it to be done by someone that had 0 clue what they were doing.  I looked for the fastest ways I could to lose weight, went to bad places for tips and guidance then proceeded to endure the most miserable 8 months of my life.  But I did lose 50lbs…

I started this by taking 3 initial actions: 
 
* Joined a CrossFit Gym
* Downloaded MyFitnessPal
* Set my daily calorie limit to a suggested (by MFP) 1500 calories

What was my diet?  Well let’s start with this question, what is a diet?  A quick Google search pulls the following definition: a special course of food to which one restricts oneself, either to lose weight or for medical reasons.  

Looking at this, I’d question if I even really can call what I did here dieting, it was just calorie restriction.  Instead of putting together an eating strategy and standardizing meals throughout the week, I took MyFitnessPal’s generic suggestion for 1500 calories a day and held it as gospel.  There’s good news and bad news with this.  The good news is that if you eat in a caloric deficit you’ll lose weight, period.  The bad news is this is the exact reason I felt like crap the entire time in diet 1.  I did not eat the right foods to properly fuel me to get through the day, none the less 4 sessions of CrossFit per week.  Macro’s were something I was aware of but didn’t pay any attention to, just the calories.  What happened during this diet?  The following poor conditions were created:

* I did not account for my starting weight or weight changes in this diet.  Starting at 218lbs a day and working out for the first time, 1500 calories a day wound up being a massive deficit
* Not accounting for macros negated a ton of progress I could have made in the gym as I likely lost a bunch of muscle due to not managing protein intake
* Black coffee was frequently the only thing keeping me awake
* Creating a situation for myself in which my body was constantly on empty wound up effecting my metabolism negatively

None of the bullet points above are good and I can tell you from experience, dieting this way sucked.  The good news is that I learned a lot from this, and I did manage to lose the weight I wanted to.  Most importantly, I built the confidence that if I ever needed to lose weight again, I can do it.  This is important in strength training as it’s hard to put on muscle without gaining a little fat.

Recap on this diet:

* Wasn’t a diet.  No set eating structure, no specific food or plan.  Essentially the nutrition strategy was “don’t eat a lot”
* 1500 calories or under was the only rule
* Macro’s completely ignored, micronutrients didn’t exist
* Any time spent in the gym was dedicated to weight loss, not strength or technique
* Workouts were whatever was written on CrossFit board
* Scale weight was more important than any other metric
* Effective for scale weight loss, not for anything else
* 2/10, would not recommend


**Diet 2 – 5 Years Later:**

Starting Weight – 208.4

Current Weight - 179


Prior to starting this section I’d like to acknowledge some changes within the 5-year time frame that are relevant.  First, I stopped doing CrossFit shortly after finishing my first diet.  My “box” went out of business, and I decided to build a home gym to do what I wanted, which is more geared towards strongman, which I’ve competed in.  My squat and deadlift are almost 150lbs+ higher than they were when I stopped Crossfit and my bench is about 75lbs higher.  I’m a lot stronger than I was and I’m not even counting ancillary lifts.

As I articulated in my write up in diet 1, I felt horrible the whole time.  My coworker used to joke all I did was yawn and drink coffee.  Also, my gym numbers sucked, and my aesthetics sucked on diet 1.  I made the decision that this time I was going to put all my lesson’s learned into this diet and do it the “right” way which to me would accomplish the following:

* Feeling generally good during the duration of the cut
* My gym numbers would not suffer terribly during the cut
* I wouldn’t feel hungry all the time
* I wouldn’t completely deprive myself of life
* Most importantly, I’d get it done as fast as possible because I hate dieting

How was I going to accomplish all of this?  Honestly, as I thought about it the reality set in that it was simple.  If I wanted to lose weight without it being a “burden” on my simply needed to find ways to move more, control the “risks” within my eating habits and build a structure to create healthy eating habits.

**Step 1 – Increase Movement:**  I don’t have a Fitbit but I do have a pedometer on my phone, to be honest I never looked at unless I felt I walked a lot and wanted to see.  During this cut I found the pedometer to be my biggest tool.  I simply looked at my yearly average from 2021 (3500 steps a day) and challenged myself to double that.  I’m 100% sure there are people here that walk more than that, however, a lot of us have desk jobs and I’d challenge any of you working in an office to find a way to double your steps.  It will pay off.  As of right now I’ve been averaging 8000 a day, way up from the initial 3500.

**Step 2 – Identify my risks and come up with solutions to them:**  You may ask yourself what the risks of a diet are?  In short, its anything that can threaten the success of your diet.  If you love to pig out on ice cream, having it in your house is a risk.  So, things like that.  What I came up with was the following:

* Set meals aren’t the problem, snacking is
* I was a 5-2 dieter meaning I ate good during the week but not on the weekend
* If I had one (alcoholic) drink, the amount I ate increased dramatically
* If I didn’t track or set amounts to eat, I ate too much


“Solving” these on paper was easy, exercising the self-control portion is a different story...  For those reading this I’m going to throw an idea out there.  We all know what our diet risks are, or in easier terms, why we’re heavier than we’d like to.  The reality is that what we really need is to accept these and exercise some self-control.  With my identified risks above, they were addressed by:

* Stopping drinking except for a couple occasions which I used as planned breaks in my diet
* Minimized the snacks available in the house.  Chips, ice cream and almonds (I know they aren’t bad for you, but I pig out on them) were removed from the house
* All meals were tracked
* Weekends no longer viewed as different than the rest of the week or “special”.  I at the same as I did the rest of the week

**Step 3 – Identify the proper TDEE:**   To do this, I started using Macrofactor before I even started the diet.  Why?  You can get good estimates through these apps and TDEE calculators, but they’re just that, estimates.  If you want your real TDEE the only way to get it is to track.  Its notable that it’s a good thing I did this because I originally undershot my activity level and had the app showing me at a starting TDEE of ~2750.  Once I tracked and made some adjustments, I found I was really burning around 3500 calories a day.  This obviously dropped as my weight did, but I adjusted along the way.

**Step 4 – Build a consistent and sustainable structure for healthy eating:**  I wanted to lose weight fast but not feel exhausted while doing so.  The best way to accomplish this would be to build flexibility into what I was doing.  Rather than saying “I’m going to use a 1000 calorie deficit” and eat 2500 calories every day I gave myself a floor and a ceiling.  The floor (2000 calories) was what I felt the minimum I could eat without feeling run down the next day, the ceiling was 2750 calories or a 1.5lb per week target.  Very simply my daily eating was this simple:

* Figure out the calories and macro’s I was going to take in between breakfast, lunch, and dinner
* If under my protein target, use protein shakes to meet it.  Hitting this is a must
* If still under 2000 calories and protein is hit, carbs taken in via some set snacks are used for more calories
* If I’m starving or tired, I eat more.  If I’m not, I don’t eat more

Building a structure into my diet was a very important step towards my diet success.  Predictability makes your odds of success grow, it seems boring, but I’d suggest it.  To achieve this, I built a dieting structure that looked like this.

**Breakfast:**  I work out in the evenings and have a desk job, so I don’t need a ton of calories for breakfast, I also hate eating it.  I put together a small breakfast for myself that included some carbs, fats and protein and decided to eat it every day no matter what.  This was simply a protein shake and peanut butter sandwich.  Since I hate breakfast anyway, this doesn’t bother me.  

**Lunch:**  I decided to eat the same lunch everyday as well, which was my version of Stan Efferding’s Monster Mash.  Now when I’m planning my week, I know that between breakfast and lunch every day I have the same X calories, protein, and carbs.

**Dinner:** This is where I gave myself some variation, but I did build parameters.  A Lean protein, 
carb, and veggie every night.  I’d wake up in the morning, figure out dinner and plug it into Macrofactor ahead of eating it.  This way I woke up every morning knowing what my base calories and macros were going to be for the rest of the day.  Anything I ate for the rest of the day was with the intention of getting to my minimum protein number and/or my minimum calorie number.

I mentioned earlier that I work out in the evenings, all my snacks were moved to be closer to my workout times.  This allowed me to have energy during my workouts and recover more efficiently.  I would suggest keeping calories closer to your workouts even if you aren’t dieting.

Essentially, I broke my diet down to 4 rules:  

* Stay within my set calorie range 
* Eat enough protein 
* Eat enough carbs to keep my energy 
* Don’t let myself get miserable by being hungry all the time

**Workouts on Diet 2:**

Knowing this is r/weightroom the next question is going to be “what program did you run and how did you modify the volume”.  This is where I experimented a little.  For the first half of my diet, I ran a Wendler 3/5/1 variation with a rotating “strip set” per main workout per week.  For the second half I ran conjugate.  As far as modifying my volume I used to do a lot to failure, I simply cut back on the amount I went to failure, specifically on accessories.

Which one of these programs worked best for me?  Hard to say.  The weight loss was the same and I’m not really testing a lot to track strength, but I can say this, I feel much more consistent on a day-to-day basis using conjugate.  With the 3/5/1 variation I was having good days and bad days with no ability to really predict them.  Conjugate made my workouts more consistent than on the 3/5/1 variation and the DE days are also very easily turned into aerobic work to help burn more calories.

**End Results:**

I started at 208 with the intention of going down to 190 and got there so easily I decided to move my target to 180.  As I’m writing this, I’ve hit my goal of 180lbs and am staying on the diet for a few weeks more because I have an upcoming vacation.  I’m going to enjoy myself on vacation and won’t track or diet at all, so this is my way of getting ahead of that.

Start Weight:  208.4
Goal Hit: 180lbs
Total Time: 11 ½ weeks


For the TL:DR crowd here is a list form of the steps I took to lose weight and build this diet.  Feel free to steal these and use them to build your own diet:

* Set a clear intention for going on this diet (weight/body fat target)
* Set parameters on what you’re willing to endure
* Identify any diet “risks” you may have.  These are the reasons why you gain weight
* Metric your TDEE on your own prior to starting your cut
* Build structure in your daily eating
* Set a calorie range to work within
* Hit your macros and hit your minimum calorie target every day
* Don’t be afraid to schedule a day or two “off” your diet per month

If you take these steps, you’ll be able to lose weight fast and efficiently.  Most importantly, it really won’t be that bad.",2022-03-29 12:25:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/tqylen/making_dieting_easy_biteymaxs_guide_to_weight_loss/
qnvejw,weightroom,[Program Review] Bullmastiff,"Hey folks! As some of you may be aware, I spent the last 18 weeks running Alexander Bromley’s “Bullmastiff” program, from the book Base Strength. Here’s my review.  

**Brief Summary**

Unbelievably good. Progress beyond what I had dared hope for. Bench in particular exploded, program was a constant challenge but never more than I could take. Would recommend to pretty much anyone.  

**Background**  

As before, mostly private. Worked a very physical career for a bit. Have always been pretty active; rugby (front row master race), swimming, hockey, Greco, a little undisciplined brawling masquerading as MMA, BJJ, competed at a few Highland Games, HEMA, and a few go-rounds in rodeos. I like doing dumb things. This has frequently gotten me injured.  

Nowadays, my main hobby sport is BJJ.   

Obviously, right before running this program, we had a pandemic! I was mostly out for about a year and a half, though as some may remember I did a heavy version of Dan John's 10k Swing Challenge at home. About 2 weeks after that, I decided that getting hit by a moped and going down a flight of stairs would be a fun lifestyle choice, which left me recovering from an injured back. Ran this program straight after recovery.  

**Results**  

*Lifts*  

Bear in mind the starting lifts were lower due to the long layoff and injury.  

- Squat: 395x1 -> 415x7. Squat saw great progress, but not as impressive as bench. Incredibly happy with the improvements here, but it suffered due to my own choices. Guarantee if I'd done things slightly differently, I'd have seen a bigger jump.  
- Bench: 295x1 -> 345x7. Good GOD my bench jumped up a notch. Otherworldly progress. Just...I'm speechless. Couldn't believe how easily and smoothly things went.  
- Deadlift: 535x1 -> 545x7. Right. This is **definitely** underselling things, and I guarantee that I can get more out of this. Like squat, I screwed things up here and didn't get everything I could have out of the program. I'll explain below.  
- Press: 215x1 -> 235x6. Like bench, this was a really stunning PR for me. I'd been at a bit of a stall in my pressing, and this was exactly what was needed to kick things up a bit.  

*Body*  

I got quite a bit more jacked - shoulders, arms and chest got substantially larger. Legs and back definitely saw some growth, but it wasn't quite as pronounced.  

Got a bit leaner too. Very happy all round.  

Sitting at about 250?  

*Other*  

Conditioning has my gas tank improved for stuff like BJJ - it takes a lot more to wreck me.  

I am ""terrifyingly strong"" to roll against, according to some training partners. One person exclaimed with dismay that ""one of [my] arms is stronger than [his] entire body"" when he completely failed to armbar me.  

I can lift someone about my size from passed out on the floor to over my shoulders, and carry them for a mile and a half. Work parties are fun.   

I can snap a pig spine into chunks with my bare hands.  

**Running the Program**  

*Lifting*  

Obviously, this is from a book, so I'm not gonna give away everything. The basic format is a base phase and a peak phase, each 3x3wk.  

The base phase uses a waved progression, building up for 3 weeks then resetting. The weight jumps for the main movement each week are based on an AMRAP set. For the secondary movement, the weight doesn't change each week, but sets get added. Accessory work follows a similar 'volumizing' approach, and is consistently fairly high rep.  

The peak phase does things differently - sets get dropped each week as the weight increases, though the AMRAP still controls weight jumps. Each wave in both base and peak has higher weight, lower reps - obviously.  

Each workout took me between 60 and 90 minutes. I added some stretching and ab work when I started having issues with tight hips. Other than that I ran the program **exactly** as written, no deviations or substitutions.  

*Conditioning*  

Can't skip conditioning. This isn't programmed, but you just gotta. I was training BJJ 3-4x pw during this program, frequently right after a morning workout - I'd lift, then jump straight into a class. That would sometimes serve as my conditioning. On other days I'd take stuff from /u/mythicalstrength's bad idea book, or come up with my own idiocy. It worked pretty well.   

*Diet*  

Not really regulated for most of the time. I had a vague idea that I should eat healthily, but didn't actually stick rigidly to anything. I like to cook and eat, so my meals were inventive. I always buy and eat good-quality meat from a sustainable, ethical farm and butcher anyway, so that wasn't an issue. I ate a lot of offal - organ meat is cheap, tasty and nutritious.  

My big breakthrough in terms of diet was ""more is good."" More below.  

Other things I did...I don't bother with pre-workout. Only supplements I used were Vitamin D in the morning & ZMA at night. Pre-lifting I'd usually have a cup of coffee.  

I also drink a blend of spinach, asparagus, celery, ginger, chillies, blueberries and green tea each day. It tastes foul, looks foul, has a foul texture. Really good for me though.  

I started having a prairie oyster to start every Saturday. Not sure why. It's just a thing.  

**What I Liked**  

99% of the entire program. There was *one* thing I would change that is actually a core part of the program rather than my own choice. The exercise selection is pretty damn fantastic, the progression makes perfect sense, and the structure is such that I was *always* challenged, but never quite failing. Don't get me wrong, I would hit 4/5 sets of squats and would seriously question how badly I wanted to keep going, but I was always juuuuust on the side of ""tough it out, you can do this.""  

**What Would I Change**  

- The one big thing I'd change that is actually a part of the program is one exercise. I hope it's not giving too much away, but the main variation provided for deadlifts was SLDLs. Now, I love SLDLs to get stronger generally - I'm convinced they're the best gym exercise for lifting odd objects - but they need to be heavy. Doing them for higher reps as prescribed just didn't do much for me - I would rather have used RDLs. I feel that they'd have strengthened my hamstrings more.  **EDIT - I no longer feel this way. In hindsight, this had more to do with me going too light on SLDLs for this volume.**     
- I guess I'd probably do more ab work? I feel like it would have helped.  
- I'd probably adjust my training max between base and peak phase, but only for squats and deads. Bench and press responded really well to the higher volume, but I feel that for squats and deads I could have used more quality sets actually shifting heavier weight. I know I got to the end of the peak phase and squats were really heavy on my back - would have been good to get more practice with that.  

**What I Learned (Re-Learned)**  

- I need to learn to stick to one bloody squat form and remember what it is.  
- I need to eat more. I had two weeks at the end of the peak phase that felt like death, but things immediately improved once I pretty much doubled my food intake. I look leaner and fitter than I did when I was clearly not eating enough, and my lifts were fine. It's weird - I've always had more issues *restricting* my intake than anything else, so to have the solution to looking leaner and curing my funk being ""oh, just eat a pound of beef for breakfast"" almost felt too good to be true.  
- I need to stretch my hips and I need to do abs consistently. My hips were suuuuuper tight and it was messing with my posture.  
- There's a lot of ways to be strong, and 1rms aren't the be-all and end-all. I clicked into this mindset about halfway through the base phase, and immediately felt pressure lift off me. I'd been a bit stuck in ""low rep high weight, grrr"" for a while, and deciding ""fuck a 1rm, strong is strong"" made me feel so much better. I'm planning on sticking with that mindset for a while.   
- Things are supposed to be fun.  This was less a realisation about lifting and more general, especially regarding BJJ. It's ok for me to grapple because I want to play-wrestle like when I was a kid, without needing to focus my life on it. Its ok for me to just enjoy doing things without having to specifically train to improve weak points or achieve certain levels. Think that was just some general growing-up.  

**Conclusion**  

This program was unbelievably fantastic, Alex Bromley gets my support and money. Fantastic content, fantastic programming, could not ask for anything more.  

Now, I admit that my progress may have benefited a little from recovering muscle memory after the lay-off, but **STILL!** Jesus, this program was an absolute BEAST! I cannot recommend it highly enough. 

*What's Next?*  

More Bromley. I'm gonna go with 70s Powerlifter - a similar layout, but a little more volume and a bit more variation in lift selection. It's gonna be good!

Lets get into the review of the past 4 weeks. This update may seem less technical and explanation-y and more filled about emotion and mental state. Prep, above all else, is a mental game.

**8 Weeks Out:** Tren and var were coming in and I felt like my progress was going well to this point, so i was excited. I expected good things to start happening, and was mostly right. Now, its important to understand that in these situations, some things become less important; specifically the scale. Sunday I weighed in at 200lbs. Friday and Saturday morning I was 205. Weight had climbed all week despite increased cardio, and coming back from a free eating few days the previous week so diet was cleaned up. A little worried but ultimately understood, tren (and to a lesser extent var) does that. I knew sunday morning would be my tell tale sign.

**7 Weeks Out:** I was right. Calipers came down 4mm despite gaining weight last week. Took some pics, got some natural lighting on my BDB and realized i looked better/leaner than i thought. So far (outside disneyland), happiest moment of prep, and maybe happier than disneyland. However, it was time to put the foot on the gas more. This was the beginning of the perpetual ""feeling behind."" Decided I would stack the fat burners and start really digging. Im fairly certain my avg intake was 100-150 more calories than listed as i forgot to input sundays calories. Barely missed steps that week, told myself i cant let that happen. mindset was: you need to dig harder, but the cravings are getting worse. Training wise, strength had been maintained with testing some lifts from the beginning of prep so alls well there. Cardio needed to push more, so big jump

**6 Weeks Out:** Started to worry, but still strongly motivated at the beginning of the week. Drastic weight drop, and proviron coming in. New drug to me, but expected almost nothing noticeable from it, at least right away. I was flat, really, really, flat, and have been for a bit. After talking to a good friend and bber, we decided a refeed was in order. 2 high carb days, I was in the position where im lean enough to see how this would affect me and could begin to understand peak week. I was finally below 200, weighing 198.6 from last thus morning to monday morning. Monday began the refeed, and it was glorious. Told my wife i got one, so she made me pumpkin pancakes in the morning. I filled the rest of my day junk loading and getting my fill while i could. pop tarts, rice krispies, little ice cream, lots of cereal. 550g carbs. Mon pre bed i weighed 202.2 without looking spilled over. Tues morning i weighed 200.6, obviously not spilled, not blurred, so carb day 2. One more pumpkin pancake breakfast (legit best tasting thing ive had all prep) and the rest of the day was going to be mostly clean to see how i look clean loaded. Rice filled most of the rest of my carbs this day. Tues night, I barely if at all looked spilled, and weighed 203.2 pre bed. Weds morning i was 201.2 with 0 spilling, but looking massive and lean. refeed a huge success. Thurs i hit my lowest weight all prep at 197.8. Magic. had tons of calories, lost weight this week, i was very happy with where i was at the end of the week finally averaging below 200lbs. However, looking over my timeline and my response to the fat burners, it was time to take a week off of both of them to re-sensitive before making 1 big push.

**5 Weeks Out:** With fat burners gone, i decided to bump up androgen load early with winny going in and upping cardio. this week, by far, was the worst. i had already been feeling a lot of fatigue, and at an hour of cardio my legs are just jelly. carbs were practically non-existent post meal 1 unless i couldnt stand it.  but the thing that absolutely destroyed my mental status was weight gain. now, i KNOW the scale doesnt tell the whole story, but at this point i was too fragile for it to go up this much while dieting like i was. i weighed 198.8 sunday and never got below 200 the rest of the week. i cracked one night and couldnt control myself and just ate 4 fistfuls of m&ms. i literally could hear myself telling me to stop but the body just moved automatically. had some other random things, all in all the day came out to 2850 calories. not a whole lot, still a deficit amount (or should be), but i fucked up. shook it off, carried on, but as the week progressed i felt worse and worse about my look. i was flat as fuck (which is fine, i expect to be) and just felt like my legs werent getting any leaner. this week i realized i just wont make it as far as i thought. decided to play with water loading as i usually drink not a lot, so i did 2 gallons thursday. 208lb pre bed, 201.2 fri morning. 1.5 gallons friday, 207 pre bed, 201 sat morning. baselined water to 1gallon every day from now on. took pics at my most watery and was laughing cuz it wasnt good but i expected the balloon look. gained 1lb this week. saturday morning i was listening to a podcast (invasive dieting 3dmj) and realized that i was being complacent this week and that kicked my ass into so much overdrive i had never been more determined. later i was watching insta for the local show going on, and was hit with another reality check when i saw the Class B guys. at this point in time, i no longer want to look at myself. i didnt even want to do check ins the next day. the end of this week was me pretty much hyper determined while also on the verge of mental breakdown and now putting on shirts/sweats when i go to the bathroom and actively avoiding looking at myself in the mirror.

**PICS:**

As much as i dont want to post these, here are the comparison shots:

[4 Weeks Out vs 8 Weeks Out](https://imgur.com/a/G0jAIRb)

Photos typically edited with Lightroom app -> auto button -> clarity 20 -> sharpness 50

i have better lighting and looking photos but honestly just dont care to post them as there is no point in looking great in different lighting to me if i cant look better in the same lighting as before. These will be the final photos ill be posting online til show day. anything you see on ig will probably be old shots, and i wont be updating anymore on the bodybuilding sub either. 

Lets review whats coming up the final 4 weeks, as there is a ""plan"" but nothing can be set in stone at this point. Oh and forgot to mention, the previous updates food screenshots are out the window. I almost changed my diet immediately after that, removing all carbs post meal 1 on rest days, and post meal 2 on training days for the first week and then only had planned carbs meal 1 for weeks 7-5 but protein went up.

**DIET:**

[This is the BASELINE diet](https://imgur.com/a/46DKvyf)

By that i mean that this isnt what my diet looks like EVERY day, but gives you an idea of what my day could look like if i am pushing hard. Again, this is not every day, nor is this sustainable at all, nor is it smart. I will only do this if i feel i can, otherwise i will typically add rice cakes or some other food to get calories closer to 2100. If i do eat this for a few days, i will probably do a 1 day refeed to refuel and bump up my average. the goal is to average about 2100-2200 a week. I discovered if i push off my first meal, this is pretty easy to do if i go to bed early. I can and have pushed off my first meal from getting up at 4am, training, doing cardio and steps, to eating at 10am and then stacking food til its around 7 and at that time the cravings are horrendous. Some changes you might not notice from previous: Egg yolk is gone, milk is gone, and i was having 2 light english muffins (100 cal each) but am now cutting those, chia seeds been gone, no more watermelon. No more fish (honestly kinda pricey and not worth the lack of fat) but that turkey is AMAZING. seriously, its pre-cooked, delicious as hell, filling, and amazing macros. Kinda worried its not exactly as written macro wise on the package compared to just cooking chicken breast, but doubt its that significant to worry. Ive been absolutely loving my spinach and tomato omelettes ive been making so i decided to sub in that (plus no fat from egg whites) in place of meat. Whole carton of egg whites can be decently filling. Im also going through costco sized spinach bags every like 3-4 days (spinach teeth is real and sucks tho). Almost every meal is a giant 1-2 fistfuls of spinach into a pan. Things im not tracking are my tiny amount of creamer (sugar free hazelnut), the tomatoes in the omelettes, and the little bit of sugar free ketchup i use/salsa on other meals. all in all thats not much calories so im not upset. Rice cakes (caramel or apple cinnamon) are amazing and a lifesaver. i will probably be filling a lot more carbs with them, i just need to find more as most places dont carry anything other than bland flavors. My current strategy when i get bad cravings but its too early for bed is to grab a sugar free werthers and get out the door for a walk. helps cure some sweet craving while getting steps in. During the day, hunger isnt too difficult as im filled with water all the time. Strawberry watermelon mio/sweetener works really well. No more caffeine preworkout, im just popping 200mg of modafinil at this point. 2 coffees post workout, no caffeine mid day anymore for the most part, occasional white monster. The diet moving forward will mostly suck. But if it works, itll be 100% worth it and more to me. I was supposed to refeed yesterday, but didnt because my mental status wouldnt let me think more food is the right move. Last night, i realized that i really needed it from a physiological standpoint. So today after much internal debate, i will do a 1 day clean refeed of about 400g of carbs, and then go right back to digging for a few days before moving up a little to average out again to where i should be. Like i said, from here on out there is no set in stone straightforward moves, it is going to be daily adjustments based on what i can and cant handle, and what needs to be done. 

**TRAINING:**

Boring. I decided to put movements in that i was testing early in prep to measure strength loss, and will be doing exact same movements to measure fatigue going forward. First week of prep i was incline BB pressing 245 for anywhere between 5-7 for my top set, and 185 for 13-16 as my back off. The past couple weeks, i reintroduced it and am hitting 245 for 5 and 185 for 14. I pretty much maintained all my strength. BB row was 275x8 start of prep and is still 275x8. I have maintained almost all my strength except in my legs, which have lost an ok amount in pressing but still hit 315 RDLs for 8. Higher reps have pretty much all gone tho, as even in back offs i tire much quicker now so high (15+) rep sets are mostly disappearing. This is fine, im still just getting adequate weight and stimulus and just lacking the glycogen stores to have longer sets. Drop sets/intensifiers have now disappeared, every thing is a straight set. no super sets, nothing. any tiny amount of twinge and i immediately drop the weight. Force that final rep/half rep? nope. Failure yes is fine, but going for the reps i know wont look good, no, nor will i even try to eek out the bottom half cleanly like i would before. Muscle gains are all but gone, the goal is preservation, injury prevention, and fatigue management. cant help it too much with legs as cardio is wrecking them, but thats why i just dont train them super hard now. The final week of training/end of week 2 are not set in stone yet. I MIGHT move legs to that previous saturday so they have a full week to recover rather than 5 days. i might not train at all friday before the show. however peak week training is all machines, everything 3-5 RIR, 50-70% volume, 0 weighted stretch movements (no RDLS, flyes, pullovers etc). The goal is to keep the muscle primed for nutrient uptake, not induce damage or inflammation, and fatigue management. The days training that week might look different come that time, we shall see. 

**STEPS:**

100k is the most i can do. this wont change until i taper off peak week. This is difficult but i still manage it somehow, even though my legs dont want to move. 

**CARDIO:**

We are now at 6 days 60 minutes. I might split some days, and do some on either an elliptical or assault bike to give my legs a little break. i wont lie, cardio sucks. but i just keep telling myself this is going to get you leaner and i get through it. most if not all cardio will be fasted with rauwolscine. how much more cardio im going to have to push im unsure, im trying not to think about it.

**GEAR:**

Tren: hasnt changed, has been doing its job. no plans on escalating tren. 

Mast: same as tren, but considered an escalation but dont believe its necessary

Test: no changes nor plans on changing. less variables changing, less to figure out.

Var: no changes, no plans on changing

Proviron: no changes, may bump to 100mg in the final few weeks but honestly am unsure why. I doubt itll give me any different of a look compared to just being leaner.

Winny: this came in earlier than planned, but dosage will stay the same through the rest of prep. unsure what to think of it yet tbh, joints are mostly ok but we will see in a few weeks.

Aromasin: debating when/if to use this. lowering estrogen can help me dry out, and possibly help me lose my stubborn fat areas (legs/glutes/chest, estrogen dominant areas for fat) but estrogen helps glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. kinda at a loss here, not much time to debate either.

sorry i know thats boring, but thats all there is to it at this point. the additions of proviron and winny will hopefully help me get dryer and harder closer to the show and if you need deeper understanding of why these drugs, read previous upates.

**THERMOGENICS:**

I pushed these hard the past few weeks, rather than offsetting each one weekly i combined them for 2 weeks. by the end of 2 weeks, i did notice i was losing sensitivity, so i took that off week. Now, its going to look ugly. ill be pushing both of these probably further than i should for the final couple weeks, and coming off the final 1-2 weeks. I took that off week because mapping out where i was and what was left, i needed a time for a break before 1 final push and this is where we ended up. 80mcg clen/6mg rauwolscine, possible elevation of one or both of those over the next 3 weeks. I dont really get this bad anxiety with them luckily. The off week did me well imo, as the rauwolscine feels like it should again. Time to just finish the job, and hopefully not have a heart attack, in which case well the job is finished.

[1 and 3 month look at RHR and sleep](https://imgur.com/a/q7CZse2)

The sleep can be a little funky as some days it just didnt measure all of it. Also that water load messed with me, as i was literally peeing 5-7x a night the next few nights. now im going roughly 3-4x.

**SUPPLEMENTS AND ANCILLARIES:**

Only real change was adding Taurine and NAC. helpful for reducing oxidative stress etc, nothing fancy or fun. modafinil is pretty much a staple now til end of prep. might have to up the sleep aid to a full serving going forward, as sleep has not been kind. almost to the point of cutting fish oil out for the reduced calories, but am pretty positive thats a dumb idea as the benefits outweigh the risks. 

**BLOODWORK:**

[If your expecting to see the epitome of health, im sorry.](https://imgur.com/a/H48UUki)

all in all, not upset about much here. RBCs are always elevated on me, and kinda expected right now. Ketones was interesting, guess 150-200g of carbs had me going keto? Easy to miss but the very top, TSH is normal. thats a big one. typically peoples thyroids look bad in prep, and use T3 to help (which i will in the future preps). I used tren to help stoke my thyroid along, and it apparently seemed to work. felt good about that. Lipids well, i dont think ive literally ever had a 40+ HDL. i was honestly expecting single digits. gotta clean that up post show but obviously they wont look good now. Creatinine pretty much where its been the past few years, but this was ran by my PCP not my nephro so no cystatin C. barely elevated liver values, call that a win. not too upset by these, getting bloods done in a couple weeks by my nephrologist too so i can make sure my cystatin C is still very good (praying that it is). 

**Mental Status:**

Its been tough. Yes thank you, i know you guys are hear to talk if i need to and many many people have offered, but at this point the only thing i want to do is put my head down and get in condition. I dont want to look at myself (which makes posing kinda hard, i actually have been skipping gym posing), im back to training completely covered, i keep looking at show winners and getting down, and i know im just stressing myself for no reason. My logic brain is still talking to me, its just being ignored. I have thoughts of quitting occasionally, not pulling out of the show just giving up on getting more conditioned. That wont happen i promise you, but the thoughts do come by when its hard. The brightest (and possibly only) spot in my life right now is how insanely supportive my wife has been. I doubt i could actually continue to do much without her, she stepped up way beyond for what is my passion. Words cant really express my gratitude towards her right now, but an understanding partner is worlds beyond amazing for where i am mentally right now. Shes excited for this to be over so i can go back to eating everything she doesnt want to finish, and im excited to do so. Im mostly flat emotionally all day, definitely more quick to agitation though. Libido talk so if tmi, skip ahead. My libido has been nonexistent since like 8~ weeks out. Ive had 1 boner outside of morning wood since then, and the thought of sex pretty much never crosses my mind. Im positive my dick still works, i just have literally 0 desire to use it and if im being honest, ive been totally ok with that this whole time because i would rather be hyper focused on the show. It is literally all consuming to me, morning to night, almost every single moment is me thinking of the prep and the show. obsessive? absolutely, but ive always been hyper competitive and i love this shit, so im ok with that. 

**Peak Week:**

Well obviously i cant tell you what i will be doing because im still unsure, but i do have plans in mind. 

things that wont be manipulated: water intake, most sodium intake. no crazy water changes, no crazy sodium manipulation. these things are way too balanced in the body to be worth trying to manipulate.

things that will be: carbs, protein-ish, fats, cardio, training. 

i dont plan on rapid backloading, so there wont be some crazy depletion. i think thats too risky and im not lean enough for it. the plan is either a front load with a swing day, or a mid load/mid load with a swing day. i like the idea behind the swing day, but to be honest if im just not lean enough i may end up ruining everything with a diuretic the night before. who knows. dont plan on it, but again nothing set in stone. cardio and steps will taper down, cardio completely leaving a few days pre show. i do NOT plan on doing the magical burger and fries the night before the show. imo, thats just absurd. why do something so drastically out of your control the night before a show after all your hard, controlled work? ill be carbing and sodiuming up on cleaner foods. the only thing im unsure of right now is my pre-stage meal, which needs to be very high sodium and high carb. probably something like rice cakes, PB, and honey/jelly. we shall see.

**Post Show Eats:**

Current plan is cheesecake factory after the show, cookies, and who knows after that. donuts in the morning for sure, never had dunkin and theres one across the hotel so will be trying those. its going to look real, real bad tho, so tune in on instagram and ill document it all! get to celebrate my birthday that im skipping cuz ill be like 2 weeks out, and going back to disneyland to eat everything again but more this time! 

Well thats all for this update. Thanks for coming along this wild journey with me, and thanks everyone for your support. Has meant a lot and continues to, and i will be doing my best not to disappoint you guys. i know i cant, but again as a hyper competitive person i put it on myself that everyone expects me to win so anything short is a failure (unless some freak just shows up, id be ok losing to someone i knew i could never beat but would be upset losing to someone i thought i could). I definitely feel like im leaving some stuff out, but ive been writing for 2 hours now and am behind eating my first meal. Feel free to leave any questions, comments, or concerns below but if not, i will see you guys for the final installment in 4 weeks: The Post Show review!",2021-10-25 16:24:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qfkfpb/contest_prep_4_weeks_out_from_first_bodybuilding/

## Training History

I started lifting in high school for football and lacrosse (2004ish), but mostly just messed around in the weight room. In college I continued to mostly just bench and work upper body with random exercises and random rep ranges. I got lazy in my mid-20s, put on weight, lost strength, and drank too much.

About 5 years ago I made my way back into the weight room to start looking less schlubby. A couple years of newbie gains where I basically just did 6-10 reps on everything and lost ~50lbs. At this point I became interested in doing my first meet so I ran through nSuns 531 and GZLP to prepare for my first powerlifting meet in 2019. After the meet, I knew it was time to put on some more muscle mass. Went through my first real bulk (which went a little too well) ending in March 2020.

Then everything shut down.

Queue up the corona depression montage here. Binging Tiger King, ordering too much DoorDash, not being accountable to workouts at home, and getting out of shape again. 

A move cross-country helped kick me back into shape and at the start of 2021 I ran through 14 weeks of SBS RTF which had me hitting all-time PRs across the board. Despite being the strongest I had ever been, I wasn't happy with how I looked in the mirrorand at about that time I realized that I needed a longer term goal: in 5 years time, I will be the biggest and strongest I've ever been while looking good naked. To start progress towards this goal, I knew I needed to improve my conditioning and trim off some of the fat that I had let gather during the lockdown.

Enter 4Horsemen

## Program Overview

I paid $25 for a fully fleshed out version of the 4Horsemen program, but you can get all of the information on how to build it yourself from the [YouTube Video here.](https://youtu.be/gTUdxnSXxU4)

4Horsemen is a 4 day a week program focusing on the squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press. Each day of the week is broken out into 4 different intensities - Brutal, Heavy, Medium, or Light - and each day is made up of 4 different sections - Conditioning, Build, Strength, and Assistance Finishers. The program consists of 3 waves of 4 weeks where each lift will undulate through all 4 intensities. 

The goals of this program is to improve body composition, get better conditioned, and get more athletic. This ticked all the boxes for me

## Modifications

### Reorganizing

The $25 version of the program has the weeks laid out in the following order:

1. Deadlift
2. Overhead
3. Squat
4. Bench

As detailed in the next subsection, I've been doing strongman event training on Sundays which meant I wanted as much recovery between that day and my deadlift and overhead days. To accomedate this, I had to change the week ordering and day ordering of the program. This sounds like a major modification, but everything fits within the matrix that Brian lays out in his video so it is a smaller change than it sounds.

Additionally, I started this program at the tail end of almost 2 months of being out of town every weekend. To compensate for 2 short weeks at the start, Week 1 was broken out into 2 weeks of 2 days of 4Horsemen and 2 conditioning days. This made the total program 13 weeks instead of 12.

Finally, I didn't strictly follow the time requirements of the program because I ran it concurrently with my girlfriend. Because we were sharing a rack and a barbell, I'm sure we took slightly longer than advertised on the program, but we only had 4 workouts that we couldn't complete in 90 mintues.

### Extra Workouts

The work days for 4Horsemen were Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday for me, but I am a creature of habit so I prefer to go to the gym/do something every single day. To accomodate this I still worked out on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. 

Wednesdays usually consisted of 10 minutes of core work, 20-30 minutes of conditioning work (thanks for the bad ideas MythicalStrength), and 20-30 minutes of low intensity cardio (mostly incline hikes, light jogs, or elliptical).

Saturdays are either a repeat of Wednesday or as the weather has gotten nicer, hikes in the local mountains. 

Sundays consist of strongman event training at a local strongman gym. This is usually RPE 6-8 work where I'm working on technique more than pushing weight or setting PRs.

### Incomplete Workouts

There were exactly 5 workouts that weren't completed to specification. 1 was because I was out of town for a funeral and the gym I visited was more of a bodybuilding style gym so the conditioning and assistance work was ad hoc that day. The other 4 were all deadlift days that were cut short because of time constraints.

## Recovery

### Nutrition

I don't count calories or pay attention to macros outside of rough guesstimating of protein. On any given day I had 160-200g of protein with the majority of the days falling around 180g. I lost ~12lbs during the 13 weeks. A typical day of eating looks like this for me:

* 4:30 AM - 2 servings greek yogurt and a banana ~25g protein
* 5:00 AM - Training
* 6:30 AM - 2 eggs, 2 plant based sausage patties, fruit, coffee with soy milk ~35g protein
* 10:30 AM - 6 oz chicken, turkey, or fish with rice and veggies. Sometimes lean meat is replaced with similar protein from tofu, seitan, lentils, or beans ~40g protein
* 2:30 PM - Same as last meal ~40g protein
* 6:30 PM - Whey protein shake with soy milk ~40g protein

### Sleep

There were only a single digit number of days where I had fewer than 6.5 hours of sleep. The vast majority of the remaining nights had between 7.5-9 hours of sleep.

## Results

## The Good

* Lost 12lbs and look leaner
* Conditioning is much better
* Strength work in giant sets was fantastic for my work capacity
* Core is as strong as it has ever been

## The Not So Good

* Set plenty of Rep PRs along the way, but no 1RM PRs at the end of the program
* Assistance work was medicore for me
* 1x per week for movement patterns seems to be too little frequency for me
* Lack of specificity on all non-main movements

## Lessons Learned

Brian's conditioning templates are great. I will continue using those as a warmup on lifting days and use them on my conditioning days moving forward.

Using giant sets for strength programming is fantastic. I plan to keep using them with whatever I do next. I am 100% guilty of skipping all core work that is programmed on its own, but I didn't skip any of it when it was a part of a strength giant set. No clue why my brain works like that, but I'm keeping it.

I really like having more structure and specificity for my assistance work. Jumping between a ton of exercises meant that I couldn't ever really get a groove and picking weights was a lot of guess and check. On top of that, I was not a fan of doing my assistance work for time. I felt like I was rushing reps and not getting near the pump/mind muscle connection I get when doing straight sets. I will not be using that format for assistance work going forward.

This was probably the last time I'm running a fat loss phase for as long as I did. I would much rather go twice as hard for half the time in the future. 6 weeks of misery is probably better than 12 weeks of slog.

## Going Forward

Next week I plan to deload. ~60% of the weight I was using for similar sets and reps. The week after that I will be in the Caribbean having fruity beverages and enjoying a vacation in the sun.

When it's time to return to real life, I will start prepping for an early December powerlifting meet that I signed up for spur of the moment. It will be my girlfriend's first meet and I have no expectations for myself other than having a good time. I'll take a week off after the meet to recover.

Long term beyond the end of the year, I need to put on more muscle mass if I want to be as big and strong as possible in 5 years so it's time...

B U L K  T O  2 4 2

I'm torn between a run of SBS Hypertrophy and Bromley's Base Strength book (Bullmastiff looks tempting from the results that HighlanderAjax has seen) while I try to put on 0.5-1lbs per week.

Then I'll continue to cycle muscle massing phases with maintenance phases to try and stay as lean as possible as I put on size.",2021-10-22 14:21:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qdhz1u/program_review_brian_alsruhes_4horsemen/

Good morning everyone and welcome back to another installment of my prep log! Things are going to be turning up a notch from here on out! Lets review the previous 4 weeks first!

[12 week update if you missed it!^[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pepj6f/contest_prep_12_weeks_out_from_first_bodybuilding/)

**12 weeks out:** cardio got introduced as i felt it was the time to start that moving. started low and slow just  to try to get used to it again. steps stayed pretty solid, bf didnt take a huge drop tho. weight this week was a roller coaster, thank god for daily weigh ins to average it out

**11 weeks out:** final week of GH, was happy to not have to pin more things. steps came down slightly, cardio went a bit faster. decided to elevate the clen this week to combat the tolerance i build after 1 week. this was a better fat loss week, calories stayed somewhat high and hunger wasnt so bad but i started to get concerned i wasnt going to make it. weight trended down the whole week

**10 weeks out:** another solid fat loss week (thank you clen), decided to bump up cardio another day as 3 days was just not enough. GH out, mast in had me feeling like i was moving towards the home stretch. decided to change clen protocol to 1 week on/off, and would utilize alpha-yohimbine during the off week. 6mg on non training days with fasted walking and cardio, 3mg on training days fasted. felt confident this was a good decision, but hunger has started to rise quickly but felt extra motivated with the changes in protocols feeling like the right decision. One thing that sucked was sunday morning i found out my watch had broke (fitbit battery died completely). i was honestly super stressed about it, it was my most important tracking tool for prep. wife said lets go to costco and i got a new versa 3, stress gone thank god. 

**9 weeks out:** This is a weird week for prep, but great for me. Wife decided she wanted to take a trip to disneyland, so T-TH we were there. it was blazing hot, but tons of fun. decided i was going to do my first and only diet break of prep. i pretty much was free eating and tried to hold back what i could but was rather difficult at that point. still did my fasted cardio while up there, still trained legs while i was up there. breakfast was like 6 rice cakes and 2 yogurts, i had also packed a ton of chicken. if i was having a meal not made by disney, it was chicken and veggies (probably about 6~ meals in total while i was up there). otherwise, it was almost a whole pizza, a lot of ice cream (crazy shake was amazing, salt and straw is divine), tons of pumpkin spice lattes, some other dinner in disneyland, a couple bites of a corndog and some churros, cookies/sweets and other deliciousness. was all delicious, and the food made me insanely vascular, never had that many spider web veins on my abs in my life. on the drive home, my wife talked to me about how excited she was for my show and she was ready to really help me stay hard on my diet and that she wants me to really succeed and be as lean as i can. it was great hearing that after all that binging and i think the mental break for both me and my wife this prep really helped relax and get ready to buckle down. steps were very high, cardio was bumped up, weight still trended down, and bf measurement still came back lower. all in all, a success.

On to the important stuff:

Now on to the plan for the following 4 weeks!

**CALORIES:**

[Current PLANNED diet for 8-7 and 6-5 weeks out](https://imgur.com/a/jM2omis)

The reason i am highlighting that this is the PLANNED diet is that i am at the point where things are subject to change more quickly. There may be more calorie drop after this week, or maybe i dont drop calories at all 6 weeks out. itll totally depend where im looking, although im fairly confident i will drop calories by 6 weeks out. Decided to find ways to drop more fat (the macro) and realized that fish is leaner than chicken. the downside is it smells fucking horrid and i dont think my wife will let me keep making the house smell like this, and we have been burning candles daily now. Moved more rice into those fish meals as they work much better with rice than other foods. Chicken meals all have a handful of coleslaw mix, and chopped lettuce (diet lettuce boy checking in) with some honey mustard. honestly, very delicious and a lot of food volume, but still leaves me hungry. Chicken seasoning has cycled from smokehouse maple (RIP, so good) to montreal chicken (still delicious). If i do take out fish, i will sub for probably 99% lean turkey or something similar. At this point, theres really not much fat im willing to part with (in the listed diet) so i will have to start debiting carbs. no refeeds planned either at the moment. on non training days, i will either remove the english muffins completely, have 1 if i want a little bit, or have both if im starving. they make 100 calorie ones that ill switch to later, as thatll keep my food volume but drop 100 cals total per day which is perfect. for now, im playing around with all the type of them. sourdough, cinnamon raisin, wheat, etc. still have ketchup, chia seeds (this is an easy cut to save 75 cals), sugar free hazelnut creamer, and so much watermelon. same caffeine intake as last time, 100mg preworkout, 1 coffee post workout, 1 white monster midday. had to make a tough decision between a 30 pack of white monsters or a 30 pack of bang, and decided my heart probably cant handle bangs right now with how much shit im taking.


**TRAINING:**

[Link to training again](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWaMYplH_v6dQZCtG7uZ1kJzmYDjsUAv0Spxav4TDGY/edit#gid=972061199)

As you can see, im still not tracking my minor muscle groups as i dont see a need. i train those just for some pumps (at least, try to get a pump) and some extra work/maintenance. major muscle groups i still try to track more closely, at the very least track a main movement. strength was starting to slowly come down, and i 100% dont have nearly as many reps in my drop sets as i used to. i gas out really quickly even if the weight drop is decently sized. slowly doing less and less finishers as i just dont think ill be able to recover completely constantly from all of this. drop sets are starting to go from 2 drops to 1 drop. all of this is done by ear, i only plan on decreasing as i feel is needed based on recovery. the closer i get to the show, the less important training becomes. 

**STEPS:**

welcome to the dig boys. this is where a major change is coming for this week, and unsure if ill maintain it moving forward. 100k steps. the workload is real. and remember, none of this is counted in my cardio sessions. im pretty much going to have to move around constantly all day to keep this up, as the goal is roughly 15k steps a day. the target here is to see just how much progress i can dig out in a week, and adjust from that. im praying i dont have to keep this up, but i will do what is needed. at least 20% of my steps will probably be me on the treadmill, so in reality im spending probably an hour+ on the treadmill a day counting cardio. the goal is to be ready a little early, and try to shed as much fatigue as i can to get to stage fresh as possible.  

**CARDIO:**

up to 5 days now, and decided to go from 20 to 30 minutes for this dig week. i dont think ill decrease the cardio from here, only steps. im sure by 4 weeks out i might be almost doubling this cardio amount, although not ramping as aggressively as i have been the past 4 weeks. this is part of the reason i dont know if food will move much, as i am hoping to just outwork a greater deficit as needed rather than drop food to pathetic levels. imo, high food high activity will lead to a greater physique than lower food lower activity. 

**GEAR:**

TRENBOLONE!!! need i say more? this is all people really cared about right? but seriously. 10 weeks out i had added masteron, and i use a long ester. this gave 2 weeks for mast to build up as i introduce tren now, but as an acetate ester so it peaks very quickly. mast helps mitigate some of the tren sides, but now i am back to pinning daily. anavar has also come in, roughly 50mg a day. this is part of the reason why im digging so hard. with this much androgenic powerful compounds coming in, it makes sense to try to just slam hard on the pedal and see where it takes me. can always back off if needed as well.

350 test: no changes still

400 mast: technically 420, but whatever. this will probably stay here, i think thats enough dose to keep what im doing and giving me the look i need.

200 tren: techincally 210. if this moves at all, itll be in the final couple weeks but i highly doubt itll move. this is more than enough for me. its main job for me is to prevent muscle protein breakdown so i can push hard to get lean without losing muscle. secondarily is the ramp in thyroid production as my thyroid begins to slow down getting this lean, and 3rd is the cosmetic benefits. all in all a good drug for prep, but not something that typically can be ran for long periods of time without detriment. i have found 8 weeks to be the max i can get the benefits from it without deteriorating my look

50 anavar: doubt ill need more than that with other orals coming in. starting this early to get that jumpstart on more fat loss and help support the look as i come down in body fat more. var is a great drug and has low impacts on your liver so it feels like an easier drug to take this far out. have my nephrologist monitoring me so ill have my kidneys checked down the line. dont expect them to look perfect, but as long as im not in danger then im solid and i never use anavar outside of prep now anyways.

50 proviron: at 6 weeks out, this will come in. proviron binds to SHBG a lot, opens up a lot of free test and can lower your estrogen. this isnt that great of a drug on its own imo, but can be solid with certain other compounds or to help lower your estrogen. terrible for your hair and prostate tho. should help dry me out a bit more and bring some more hardness possibly

50 winny: at 4 weeks out, the final drug comes in. winny ALSO has a strong affinity to SHBG, but guess what? proviron has been taking care of that! so that means winny will give me much more benefit in other areas like hardness/separation. never used winny so this will be a learning experience on this one. to be honest, i might just be redundant with all the hardners i have going on, but fuck it i like to experiment and how else can i learn my body if i dont try it myself?

the holy trinity of injectables is in, and soon the holy trinity of orals will be in. its time to get freaky looking fellas

**THERMOGENICS:** 

As stated earlier, i have switched clen to 1 week on/off. if this enough to reset receptor sensitivity? probably not completely, but this is also why i will slowly ramp the dose up as well, capping at 80mcg a day. so far, clen hasnt been giving me any issues at all. no crazy heart pounding or anxiety, no shakes, just great fat loss and an increased RHR. Rauwolscine (alpha-yohimbine) on the other hand, gives me heart pounding and a little anxiety. however, this combo is just so incredible that i have no problems dealing with it. clen hitting the beta receptors for fat loss, and A-Y hitting the alpha receptors for the stubborn fat loss areas. covering all my bases, at some point i might just end up running them together for a brief period of time near the end to get any final fat i can before hitting the stage. my hamstrings are pissing me off and need to lean out quicker, however the likely case here is that i will lose my back legs last. i wont be surprised if my upper body is ready to go by 4-5 weeks out, its just getting that stubborn area out thatll take the final digs and drug pushes of clen + A-Y. you are only as lean as your fattest body part, so i pretty much only stare at my hamstrings at this point when looking at pictures, i dont even both looking at my abs or whatever. back has been leaning out really well too shockingly so ive stopped worrying so much about that. and for those wondering, yes clen + A-Y is going to come with a good amount of pounding heart and anxiety. its not something that can be used long term, and probably even short term would be too difficult for a lot of people. dont try this, it isnt necessary. ill report back of course on how it goes for me.

[RHR and SLEEP Graphs.](https://imgur.com/a/VMX8Qtw)


**SUPPLEMENTS AND ANCILLARIES:**

All supplements are currently the same, however soon i will be adding in P5P to combat prolactin build up from tren, Taurine to help alleviate the painful pumps i might end up getting from oral use, and NAC to help combat systemic inflammation from the tren and orals. Oh, and i added a sleep aid 2 weeks ago and am continuing that. Sleep aid from gorillaminds (idk what its called), the serving dose is 4 capsules i believe but ive only been taking 1 to start, and will slowly increase that as time goes on to help make sure i can get my meager amounts of sleep and be as rested as possible from it. 

**Miscellaneous:**

Watching the arnold gave me some good motivation, but i am also just completely focused on this now to the point of obsession (shocker, the guy who writes a fucking novel every other week is obsessed). Family visiting will be pulled back now, as arriving and them telling me they bought me donuts before my wife reminds them i cant eat that cuz of my diet is tiresome. A good buddy of mine told me he believes i have the potential to turn pro in 1-2 years which is awesome, and more friends in the gym telling me how excited they are to see my progress coming up to the show. Love to hear this stuff, but also hard to remember that i cant let that put tons of pressure on me or ill overstress and fuck up my look. Ill do everyone proud, but i also just need to kind of keep my head down and ears shut from things like that right now (but i will admit, it does feel good to have people believe in me). At this point im kind of just ranting along, but i needed a section to tell you guys where i am at mentally as thats just as important at this point of the game. I dream of losing every once in awhile, and im always devastated in the dream and when i wake up and it just furthers my drive to keep pushing. i try to daydream as much as possible about winning, and posing with confidence etc to try to keep as champion a mindset as i can. anyone whos dieted deep before understands this, my brain power/memory is starting to slowly decline. spacing out, bumping into things a little more often, forgetting things etc ""prep brain"" has started to slowly show up. patience is getting thinner than my hair soon, and im trying to make sure not to start pushing people away as the prep gets harder. 

**Weakpoints:** was told i have ""white boy arms,"" flat shoulders, and no chest (very true), and ""geek genetics."" decided that sounded dope, so i am probably going to start branding myself with Geek Genetics (training? fitness? idk if ill need another word after that). guess off season i need to get bigger arms, bigger shoulders, bigger chest, thicker back, and thicker hamstrings. yea no problem right?

**Strength:** occasionally i try a bb compound movement and it aint pretty. im absolutely weak as hell now. barely got 185 for 6-8 on flat bench the other day (mind you this was after incline machine work and flyes). still was able to do 315 for sets of 6 on SLDLs, but probably could do more with straps. leg strength isnt going that badly, but pressing power is horrible.

**Posing:** i really need to start practicing my routines and also work on posing stamina. 1 round and im winded usually, that has to improve significantly. heres something i think you guys should see too

[Feb 2021 Posing](https://imgur.com/a/2rsKx8p)

this is why i tell you guys to practice practice practice. it doesnt take much tweaks but those tweaks make HUGE differences in presentation. even now i am tweaking things and trying to make sure i am posing everything correctly and seeing if theres better ways to hit certain poses

**Hair:** this shit is gone man, it was nice while it lasted. probably be bald by christmas 

I might have missed some things, so if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below. If not, see you in 4 weeks and hopefully we will be looking like we are putting together a winning package!",2021-09-27 15:58:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pwk459/contest_prep_8_weeks_out_from_first_bodybuilding/
pf0z49,weightroom,"[Comp. report] BNB Brawn IV 2021 - Powerlifting, unaffilitated","**Background**

This was my second powerlifting meet, and I was coming into this after a decent period of strongman programming. I felt much stronger, and ready to put in a decently competitive total.

My main priorities coming into the meet were

* Put up a big squat

* Refocus on powerlifting, and put all the gains that strongman has given me to good use.

* Keep my shoulders healthy 

Training leading up to the meet consisted of a 8 week strength block, forced deload by being sick, 6 week peak, and one week taper programmed by Jean-Stephen Corabeouf (Aus strongest man 2019)

The only really unusual part of the prep was that I kept log clean and press and overhead work in rotation until the week before taper to keep my shoulders healthy. As a result, I didn't have any shoulder issues with squat or bench, and feel ready to start working on my next comp without needing as much down time to let my body recover.

I was the only person in the u105kg class, so I had my eyes set on best lifter for the day to make it more entertaining. There was two other guys in the u94kg class that were my closest competition for this.

A month or so before the comp the federation it was affilliated with imploded because Robert Wilks is a POS. This left the comp unaffiliated and un drug tested. I'll have to look for another tested fed to join in future, because that was the primary reason I competed in PA.

**Weigh-in**

Weighed in at an easy 102.35 with a burrito in my belly and two cups of coffee on the drive up. There was zero chance of overshooting my weight class, so my priority was just having a good breakfast and being able to perform well.

The people running the comp seemed to have misread the rules on calling people up for their weigh-ins, because instead of sending missed calls to the back of the line, they stood there yelling out their names over and over while I waited to jump on the scales, instead of just skipping past them. All the lifters they were recalling were from the gym running the comp, so who knows... The meet director did eventually call them out on it.

[**Squat**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTG_ieih3TG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Warmups were feeling phenomenal on squat - 70kg/120kg/170kg/220kg. Just tried to keep pace with when my flight would be coming up, feel I timed them pretty well

1st - 240kg ⚪⚪⚪ Easy as can be. Just building confidence out of the gate and showing the refs what to expect

2nd - 270kg ⚪⚪⚪ A harder lift with some grind, mainly because I went as low and slow as possible to make sure I got my depth - Heaviest squat of the meet by 23kg

3rd - 275kg 🔴🔴🔴 Harsh depth call (and the head ref apparently calls depth too now?) Looked pretty good to me, and I stood up with it, so it counts in my book. Didn't let it phase me.

[**Bench**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTHBnUcBiVH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

1st - 110kg ⚪⚪⚪ Another easy opener, showing full control of the bar and commands

2nd - 125kg ⚪⚪⚪ Felt really strong with this, a little grind

3rd - 132kg 🔴🔴🔴 Tried for a PR, but no dice. Strength just wasn't quite there for it. 

[**Deadlift**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTHDYdvBNV2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

1st - 240kg ⚪⚪⚪ Easy lift, blood pressure dropping a bit at this point so saw a few stars, but feeling confident in my next lift

2nd - 260kg 🔴⚪🔴 Most confusing call of the day. Got the down signal from the head ref, and stood up to the sight of two red lights. This was an easy pull, so I was fucking livid about getting called for ""soft knees"" Nearly missed my chance to put in a third attempt because I was trying to ask the refs what the hell happened and they wouldn't spit it out.

3rd - 265kg ⚪⚪⚪ Went with a safe jump, even though I knew I could have ground out 270kg with favourable judging. Was so heated I didn't listen to any music or do anything to hype myself up before the lift. Just went out there and took what I deserved. 2nd heaviest deadlift of the day, heaviest conventional.

**Final result**

660kg total at 102.35 (up from 582 at 99.6 last year)

1st place in u105kg (lol)

3rd best lifter. Would have had 2nd if I had gotten the 5kg on my squat and been able to make a full jump to 270 on my deadlift.

Heaviest squat of the meet, and at 270kg breaks the top 40 u105kg squats in Australia, regardless of fed or drug testing. 6th heaviest u105kg squat in all of 2021 in Aus.

Extremely happy with my prep and my results. At the start of the 16 weeks out, I was struggling to squat 180 for reps, and managed to hit a meet day PR and 3 squats over 270kg for the first time in over a year.

Going to jump into [Static Monsters 2021](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CTI9eMnBadr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) after this and put up a big suited deadlift and log PR.

**16 weeks out:** Busy week, that sunday to start the week was my daughters bday party, so i had an absolute huge load in steps this week. Gear was building, nothing crazy or fun to report. calories started coming down and i was hungry but completely manageable. some more research was done into prep and i decided it was soon time to try things out.

**15 weeks out:** steps came down to a little more normal, maybe a bit high. caliper reading had me feeling good, weight staying up i didnt mind as i had a decent drop after the weekend. calorie drop a small bit and i was a little hungrier, but didnt need to make any changes to myself. i decided to try out clen this week and next to test some things which i will go into further depth later. Motivation and focus hits an all time high as the industry loses one of my biggest idols.

**14 weeks out:** Sunday i was so busy, it was 5pm and i only had 2 meals. Down 2k calories for the day, I decide to kill a craving and stay within calories by having 4 rolls of sushi. bloated me right up, now know that i cant carb load or anything with sushi as itll destroy my midsection. calipers looked ok, steps came up this week. was concerned all week as my weigh ins for 5 days straight was 209.4-.6

**13 weeks out:** Got the whoosh i was looking for, dropped 3lbs randomly in one night for monday morning. weight steadily climbed back up throughout the week but maintained at 208.4-.6 until saturday when i happened to weigh 1lb up back to 209.6. Saturday was a busy day, picked up a treadmill and had to run around so i once again ended up with 2 meals and down ~1600 cals. was out with the family, decided id have a real cheat meal as i thought it would be beneficially for social/psychological reasons. had a lettuce wrap burger, 2 baskets of fries, touch of cake for dessert, calorie tracker said i stayed within my calories for the day. that was my last meal of the day, popped 500mg of metformin before bed and woke up sunday morning 12 weeks out feeling amazing and looking amazing and down to 208.2. I also had this kinda weird epiphany moment this week. I was checking through pics for progress and realized that i really only noticed much in my midsection and maybe a bit in my back but nothing in my arms or shoulders. At first i was depressed about it, but then a couple minutes later i realize im an idiot. My biceps are skin lean, like back of your hand skin lean (pinch the skin on the back of your hand, same thickness on my biceps) and my triceps arent far behind so its obvious i wouldnt have any crazy visual difference, theres not much more difference to make. i felt much better about that and continued on with the plan!

Lets get to the part we care about

Now on to the plan for the following 4 weeks!

 **CALORIES:**

[Diet for 12, 11, 10, and 9 weeks out](https://imgur.com/a/7jpO2DD)

Carbs are getting shaved off and you can see fat has as well. Fat turns very minimal by 9 weeks out as my 1 red meat meal turns into chicken. It doesnt have to be chicken though, as last night i had ran out and decided to cook my tilapia for the meal instead. any hyper lean food source works, chicken is just cheapest and easiest. Still have all of the extras in the diet right now, little ketchup, chia seeds, little sugar free hazelnut creamer, chicken broth on my rice, none of which is accounted for in my calories. Extra veggies might have to come in around the 10-9 week out mark as such little amount of rice is starting to get depressing to my asian genetics. 

Current caffeine intake (dont judge me): 100mg preworkout, 1 coffee post workout, 1 white monster midday. On rest days, i start the day off with a bang (ha ha) and star blast flavor is the best dont @ me. midday ill probably have either a white monster or some iced coffee from starbucks. 

Also to note on rest days: i cut out the bagel/english muffins. drops 300 calories for the day in mostly carbs. 

**TRAINING:**

[Link to training again](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWaMYplH_v6dQZCtG7uZ1kJzmYDjsUAv0Spxav4TDGY/edit#gid=972061199)

Once again, this sheet was made strictly for you guys as i really dont care for strict tracking my training right now and i dont even do it all. Im trying to keep a small base track of some movements so i can pay attention to strength levels, but small muscle groups i just completely bro the fuck out which is why you see 0 tracking, although the volume listed is usually pretty dam close if not exact. small muscle groups is just get a pump, do whats available and i feel like doing. Doesnt help that my training partner just trains like the purest of meatheads you can think of. During this time, i actually tried flat bench for the first time in forever, and immediately after i was done with it a chick came to use it and she proceeded to outbench me. told my training partner im never doing bb bench again (jokingly, idc about being weak but dam shes fucking strong). also decided to bb squat, and that was also a good reminder of how i dont like squats, but also how as i lose weight that kind of movement pattern feels less and less stable. idk how you guys under 242lbs can feel stable in that movement. everything else, normal training for me as you guys know me. anything i wrote down in the sheet with a plus sign means i did a drop set after. one thing i did note, i run out of gas much quicker in the drop sets than before, reps during those extended sets just seem to disappear. losing pre and intraworkout carbs will do that to you i suppose.

**STEPS**

Steps are ramped up fast, but im happy to not have a step increase over the next 4 weeks. my goal currently has been 80k steps a week, but seems to end up around 83k. as long as i hit 80k im happy, which isnt terribly difficult as long as im conscious about it. Bringing my daughter to the zoo weekly, maybe the beach, etc adds a lot of easy steps. Costco shopping weekly, pacing around between sets at the gym, pacing when my foods in the microwave, any movement i can get it do. During my rest days, i was starting the morning with a brisk walk for about 30 minutes. is that cardio? a lot would probably say yes, but remember activity im doing with my watch on to count steps isnt cardio. 

**CARDIO**

Cardio has begun this week at 3 days for 20 minutes 10% incline and 3.2mph speed. not hard, but coming from no dedicated cardio its a great start to get the systems going. I pushed off starting cardio as long as possible because your body does adapt to it and thats the last thing ill want to be happening as i get leaner. however, i dont want to fall behind either so cardio comes in now, and possibly ramps up slowly over these next 4 weeks as im playing it by ear. 2 of the sessions are morning fasted (rest days), 1 session is afternoon. 

**GEAR**

Couple alterations to the intial plan, like pulling out proviron. The decision came from a couple thought processes. 1. i didnt wanna further hair loss right now and 2. i dont need it right now, so why take it. its great for pushing free test high, estrogen down, and giving me a harder look all of things i dont need right now and will save the balding for the end of prep.

350 Test: no changes to this at all

300 EQ: this will soon be dropped, as its been saturating for awhile and after i drop it 10 weeks out itll slowly come down and almost come out of the system by the time prep is ending so ill reap some benefits from this for the rest of prep

400 Mast: one of my favorite anabolics, starting early to get that DHT derivative action saturating for 2 weeks so itll be built in my system for when i introduce tren. Mast being a DHT derivative also can help a little with my metabolism and fat loss. Stays in the rest of prep and highly doubt ill be increasing it as i think ill max out the cosmetic effects of masteron at around 400mg.

GH: byebye GH. pretty simple, i run out. i could get more, and i havent fully committed to not, but i just really dont think i need to use the money on GH for a fat loss phase. it helps yes, but for the money and hassle i dont think its currently worth it. if i notice some radical negative changes, ill make sure to grab some and reintroduce it back at 2ius 5 days a week. 

**THERMOGENICS**

Ok i said i would talk more about clen here. So after looking more and more and more into clens usage for fat loss, i pretty much settled on that it has an efficacy of what seems like a max of 21 days. This is due to b2 receptors downregulating from clen. This is typically why you see a lot of people have different protocols of time on and time off. I decided to test how long i personally would be able to push clen before i adapted to it, so i started at 40mcg and settled on that for 2 weeks. well it turns out, after 1 week i started to lose some of the effects of clen and by the end of week 2 i was getting a lot less out of it. took my week off, and now entering 12 weeks out ill retest with the same starting dose but ramp up for week 2 to see if i can still eek out effects before stopping for another week break and then decide what my future protocol will be. Some people may be aware of the use of ketotifen, an antihistamine, to combat the downregulation of b2 receptors when taken in combination with clen. this is true, but also now comes with the side effects of the new drug your taking (no free rides as they say). sides of antihistamines? sleepiness, lowered energy, decreased metabolism, **increased hunger,** yea none of these things seem like something i want in prep. so im taking a drug for fat loss, and a 2nd drug to help that fat loss but it also increases hunger and lowers your metabolism? imo, not worth it but i know of people who use it to good effect. 

some interesting things for you guys to check out on my resting heart rate. you can actually see where clen stopped being so effective and when i stopped taking it, as well as in the zoomed out versions of more months you can see when i dropped tren and also probably get an idea of my blasts coming and going 

[RHR graphs](https://imgur.com/a/34eawXX)

**SUPPLEMENTS AND ANCILLARIES**

no changes to report, also will not be taking nebivolol most likely unless my BP tells me to. nebivolol is great for blood pressure and lowering your resting heart rate because its highly selective of the b1 receptors, but that also means it might slightly inhibit fat loss especially with the effects of clen. 

**Miscellaneous**

[BLOODWORK LINK!](https://imgur.com/a/SJlJiIT)

got my quarterly bloods done from my nephrologist done, he knows i have a show coming so we planned the next one to be just before peak week and i hope hes sitting down when he gets it. as for this test, RBC stuff should obviously be elevated, thats super typical with EQ. i make sure to stay hydrated, might need to take some baby aspirin, but tbh im not concerned with these numbers. One thing that shocked me was the creatinine drop. i was only concerned of it going up a bit, but was still expecting/hoping for it to stay in the 1.7s. Dropping to 1.56 was a great relief in my book, and i think i figured out what caused it although i know there are plenty of people who will furiously deny me. Supplements. Astragalus + dong quai continuously for months has helped drop my creatinine levels. No, its not drug changes or doses, ive ran more gear and less gear and even these same compounds before but in higher doses, and all of it was around 1.6-1.7s. No, its not training. ive done so many bloods, ive done them on rest days, training days, ive taken 3 days off of training, high volume, low volume, still sat in the 1.6-1.7 range. Super happy to find out im not seemingly wasting my money on the supplement. Also, if your freaking out telling me im going to die of kidney failure soon, ill let my nephrologist know he needs to be freaking out instead of telling me i look good because some random internet guy said so. plus, peep that cystatin C, *chefs kiss.* Hemoglobin A1C not moving is impressive. ive ran 2-4ius of GH almost continually from the time i got it tested before and it literally didnt change. guess the 5 on 2 off protocol really helps with that? idk, but its cool to know. Vit D has been coming down because my nephrologist told me too, didnt like it in the 80s as he didnt want me risking possible kidney stones so i have been doing 2000ius of vit D since february. Increased creatinine in urine made sense to me since its not in my blood anymore but again, doc said i look solid see you in 3 months lol. 

**Weakpoints:** yes im still aware i have them thank you

**Strength:** slowly coming down, but my training partner pushes me very hard so its not going badly

**Posing:** still no mirror for check ins at home, but feeling better about my posing

**Hair:** pls stop

Thanks for joining me once again, and i will see you guys in 4 more weeks! the suck will reallyyyy be kicking in by then and ill slowly be getting more and more irritated at everyone so expect me to seem like a dick which isnt unusual but ill be less likely to try and not be. 

As always, ask anything youd like and id be happy to answer!",2021-08-30 19:43:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pepj6f/contest_prep_12_weeks_out_from_first_bodybuilding/
p9gamz,weightroom,Meet Report: USPA Sink or Swim,"Yesterday was my 7th powerlifting meet, my first with USPA.

I competed in the 90kg weight class. I wanted to compete in the 82.5kg class, but I missed weight. Weighed in at 82.6kg lol. Next time, I'll start off leaner.

I accidentally registered in the wrong category. I meant to sign up for raw as I use sleeves, but I signed up for classic raw instead, which is raw + wraps. Didn't matter, as I was the only 90kg female lifter anyway, but next time, I have to remember what the different classes actually mean and sign up for the correct one.

**Goals**

My goals for this meet were:

* Get a ~~400 wilks~~ 413 DOTS (a 400 wilks was my goal when I first started powerlifting)
* Get at least a 455kg total
* Win my weight class 
* And as always, have fun

**Training**

I have been doing [Simple Jack'd](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/simple-jackd/)for the last 12 weeks. It's a pretty simple template, pick 1 or 2 focus lifts that you do each session, and then rotate accessories (push variation, pull variation, squat variation) through out the week.

I started with squat and bench each training day, but I got burnt out from all the squatting and switched to bench and deadlift every training day. I brought squats back in 3 weeks out (did squat, bench and deadlift each training day with no accessories).

My last deadlift was 8 days out, my last squat 6 days out, and I did very light bench about 4 days out. Rested completely Wednesday-Friday.

**Nutrition**

Kind of just stuffed my face. Will need to be more thoughtful about this in the future. 

**Water Cut**

Although I didn't make weight, my water cut went pretty well. I dropped 8lbs and was able to get it all back before I got on the platform without sacrificing performance at all. I used Alex Bromley's [video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj7r4P4g8XyAhUmTt8KHcZKDmcQwqsBegQIBhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtCCbyPgM-9I&usg=AOvVaw1u_4bK4rD5LdoaDJDSmUhb), which was quite helpful.

The only issue was the scale I had been using to track my weight was too friendly, so I thought I had made weight with a 1lb to spare when I had not.

I was, however, able to rehydrate very well. I had Pedialyte, Gatorade, Powerade, coffee cake, pancakes, chicken and rice, and a big cookie.

**Meet Time** 

My best lifts are [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CS4d9iLAb96/?utm_medium=share_sheet).

Squats went very well, 3/3 142.5, 152.5, 162.5-2.5kg meet PR . The weights moved quickly, but I have to be careful here. My left hip isn't as mobile as my right, so sometimes I don't get down deep enough even though. I could have gone for more on the third attempt, but I didn't want to risk my total.

Bench went very well, 3/3 85kg- 2.5kg meet PR, 92.5-7.5kg meet PR, 100kg- 7.5kg meet PR. Bench has been my worst lifts, so it was very exciting to see how it's improved over the last 2 years. I never thought I'd get 200lbs in competition, much less 220. I wanted 226, but I barely got 220, so I picked my third attempt correctly.

Deadlifts were funny. I got redlighted on my first one, 165kg, as it went too quickly. The side judges didn't see me lock out my hips. I focused hard on my next one 185kg and got 3 white lights. Finished the meet with 200kg- which was a 12.5kg meet PR. I failed 190kg at my last meet, so getting 200kg felt great.

**Organization**

The meet ran pretty smoothly. They started on time and kept things moving. The loaders and spotters were on point. The judges were very friendly. When I missed my first deadlift, a judge came up to me and explained why.

Everyone was pretty friendly when it came to working in for warmups and sharing plates, collars, whatever you needed. People loaded plates for each other and cheered each other on. It was a great atmosphere. USPA, I'll be back!

**Results**

Well I won my weight class, party of 1 lol. I beat my goal, totaled 462.5kg. Officially in the 1000lb club, and I have a DOTS of 429.01. 

From here, I'm going to focus on my Strongman comp in 6 weeks (first one). Then I'm going on a diet. I have at least 20lbs of fat to drop, and then I'll get back on the platform in 2022.",2021-08-22 17:05:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/p9gamz/meet_report_uspa_sink_or_swim/
owjpw2,weightroom,[Contest Prep] 16 Weeks Out From First Bodybuilding Show,"Hello and welcome to r/weightroom's first ever contest prep log, and my first ever contest prep in which I will be doing Classic Physique! The show is the Ultimate Warriors by Muscle Contest on Nov 20th! Week before thanksgiving! Join me in my descent to ~~madness~~ leanness that is targeted for deaths doorstep. I will be making the biggest mistake any first timer ever does which is being my own coach! I figured that after so many years of learning what I can, this would be a great opportunity to actually **really** test myself. Updates will be posted every 4 weeks so if you like, please follow along! 

First and foremost the literal only important part! 

[16 WEEKS OUT MANDATORIES](https://ibb.co/album/J31vq3)

Photos will always be in that spot, directly after waking up on Sunday and having a sip of water. Photos edited with Lightroom (all photoes edited the same way, auto button, 20 clarity, 100 sharpness). 

[The Current Plan Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJMTutnC49WgBDIXEYAAudFiv5U4FPy7UJE90KyiQGQ/edit#gid=0)

This sheet is my outline/draft of what this contest prep will look like. ill go into detail on all of it later, but for now you can give this a quick look over and then read the sections down below as nothing in the plan is set in stone, and contest prep isnt so easily linear as i have it written down. again, this is a draft/guideline and i make harder or easier adjustments based off how the current plan is working. on to the explanations:

**CALORIES**

[Diet for 16, 15-14, and 13 Weeks Out](https://imgur.com/a/BflPzA5)

Food is pretty straightforward right now. meal 1 is post workout, and subsequent 4 meals after that are every ~3 hours. Food choices are very simple. I also have a coffee with 1 sugar 2 cream in the morning and midday, as well as chia seeds in my oats and a little ketchup on the eggs (none of which i count in my calories as its consistent and most likely never leaving unless needed). chicken/beef seasoning is either some mccormicks seasoning or Kinders (i tend to cycle through different ones). rice meals i pour chicken bone broth on because it tastes good and is good for digestion/gut health. most importantly i eat my chicken and rice with a spoon because i use a bowl. forks make 0 sense.

Strategy for cutting back is first cut a little fat, then cut carbs. protein stays roughly the same, only losing some from the changes in carb sources. doesnt make sense to drop protein obviously, but also doesnt make sense to increase it either. anabolics help retain more nitrogen/are anti catabolic and my total protein intake per lb of bw increases as i lose weight so it does the job itself. I do hope to be eating as much food as im listing, but i have a sneaking suspicion that by the end of prep ill be on lower calories than i anticipated.

**TRAINING**

[Training Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWaMYplH_v6dQZCtG7uZ1kJzmYDjsUAv0Spxav4TDGY/edit#gid=0)

ill be completely honest. i only put this together for you guys, i didnt have any intention of doing a training sheet or even really keeping track during this. at this point, training is not the most important thing and becomes even more irrelevant as i get closer to the show. im not putting on any appreciable size, but im probably not losing any big amount of size either. the goal is simply to train hard within my limits of recovery and that means auto-regulating by feel. but to give you a rough idea of how my plan works, anything with 2 sets is 1 top set 1 back off, 3 set stuff typically is a double drop set at the end. its honestly refreshing thinking much less about what exactly im going to do and more just pushing myself hard, but come offseason ill be back to meticulous planning as i think its more important to do when your actually utilizing training for maximum growth. eventually volume will come down, drop sets will disappear and finishers will disappear as my calories and recover all come down.

**STEPS**

im pretty sure i am undershooting how much steps ill be at 16 weeks out so ill adjust that as i go along, but i was averaging 70k steps a week a month ago but the past few weeks that number has climbed so my daily activity is a bit higher entering prep. adjustments up are 5% at a time, and i like weekly goals rather than daily personally. i dont keep my watch on for things that involve a lot of wrist/hand motions (haha masturbation) such as washing dishes or folding laundry so i dont skew step counts. as i start needing more steps, ill start incorporating them in any area i can. walking between sets, walking while heating up my food on the microwave, parking in the back of a parking lot, taking my daughter to places that require tons of walking, etc. have to trick myself into moving more as i get more fatigued. 

**CARDIO**

you might notice this is blank. thats because i dont have a set plan on cardio right now. and for cardio, this is exercise **outside of step count.** any treadmill/stair/bike whatever exercise i choose for cardio, ill take off my watch. this is to account for the **added** cardio and exercise which is what it should be. 2 things about this. 1. remember that there is no cardio component to the contest (besides posing) so there really is never a NEED to do it (not counting health etc) and it should be used with the goal to be increasing energy expenditure which leads to 2. increasing cardio and then sitting your ass on the couch all day cuz your exhausted now does **nothing for your energy output.** if extra cardio is being negated by being less active throughout the day, your making no change. so the easy way to combat this is make sure it doesnt effect your counted steps! so when i feel like im starting to fall behind in prep, thats when i will begin to add/add more cardio. for now, im going to see what changes i make without dedicated cardio. this just means when i wake up and go for a 30 minutes walk on rest days, that counts towards my steps and not cardio but when i need cardio, ill leave my watch at home and then try to make up the steps casually throughout the day. 

**GEAR**

you all see the plan, and im sure you want me to go in depth on everything but im not as that would be a very, very long post. so for now i will only touch on the next 4 weeks planned usage (sorry everyone i know this is like the only thing most people want to hear about). if you want to ask specific questions about my plan go ahead but i will go into greater detail on it in future updates.

350mg Test E: pretty standard/simple for me. i aromatize a lot, so i dont want to run high test and have to account for that. i also dont understand why i would run high test. its not the most anti-catabolic hormone out there, and im not really going to be gaining tons of muscle over the next few months. a simple base to keep somewhat full and strong and anabolic without going overkill or causing me any unwanted issues.

300mg EQ: super long ester boldenone, known for highly increasing RBCs, increasing hunger, and modulating estradiol. if it increases hunger, why run it in contest prep? well for starters i dont get the huge hunger increase. maybe a little but its manageable. the important characteristics im getting out of it is the elevated RBCs and estradiol control, with its anabolic properties coming in after that. elevated RBCs = better for endurance and movement, great for a time where i am focused on doing a lot of that with my training and also if cardio comes in (and elevated RBCs being bad for possible stroking out btw, dont do drugs kids). the long ester means that i can cut the EQ out about halfway through prep and itll still be active almost the rest of prep, albeit less so which is perfect for me as its less things that are lingering and effecting me as i need to dial in everything, but still present when im needing any little boost i can get in the final few weeks.

2ius GH: taken fasted first thing in the morning 5 days a week. great for helping you lose fat, and since i have cut all pre/intra workout carbs etc, that means the fat and glucose being released into my bloodstream from the GH will act as my intra workout ""nutrition"" helping me burn off a little extra fat. why only 6 weeks? because i have 6 weeks worth leftover and didnt feel like storing it for 5-6 months not using it. really that simple, and i didnt feel like buying more as i had almost everything i needed already on hand so it wasnt costing me a ton to run the rest of the cycle. besides imo, GH for fat loss is an inferior use of a great, (relatively) expensive drug. 

**THERMOGENICS:**

none this update! for those looking beyond and trying to figure out wtf, dont bother. im not even set on how im going to be using the clen. ill update on that in the future but for the curious, clen for fat loss typically is cycled as it tends to lose efficacy about 20 days post use for fat loss. some people do 2 weeks on 1 week off, or 1 week on 1 week off etc. idk how i plan on using it. youll notice i have the word keto in there. that is short for ketotifen, an antihistamine drug. the mechanism that clen burns fat is through the beta2 adrenergic receptor and eventually those downregulate so clen becomes less effective. ketotifen upregulates b2, and there has been studies showing that a combination of clen and ketotifen prevents the downregulation of b2 so its possible to continually use clen with ketotifen and get the fat loss. ""but iskeezy why then wouldnt you just do that?! its magic! it works! its a match made in heaven!"" people always forget that DRUGS.... have side effects. yes, clen + keto works. but what do ANTIHISTAMINE drugs tend to do side effect wise? well histamine regulates appetite... so antihistamines drive up HUNGER! the very thing we are trying to keep at bay! also, ever take a benadryl? (which btw doesnt work with clen. yes an antihistamine, no benadryl doesnt effect b2s like keto). what happens after you take the benadryl? you get sleepy! so we have this wonderful drug that helps clen stay effective at the receptor level, but at the cost of **increased appetite, decreased energy, and decreased metabolism.** is that worth it? well idk yet, we will find out in a few weeks possibly!

**SUPPLEMENTS**

Fish oil: straightforward, something like 6 pills a day split amongst meals.

COQ10: heart health supplement, should be something anyone who does things that are bad for your heart should take. 

Vit D: 2000ius a day. i recommend people take more but ive had my levels checked multiple times and all i need is 2k a day to stay in the 50-60s. 

Chromium Picolinate: insulin sensitivity supplement, seems to help with body recomposition as well. i remember hearing something about how certain vitamins/minerals get used up quicker with AAS and chromium was one of them so someone on gear should probably supplement it. idk how much benefit it would give a natty either so dont ask cuz idk how much ill get out of it myself.

Astragalus/Dong Quai: kidney support, the two together seem to have greater efficacy when taken together. 

ZMA: sleep, health, all around great supplement for anyone. 

Magnesium Glycinate: again as an AAS user and lifter, magnesium is something i think needs to be made sure to get enough of and this can also help with sleep. while im sure you can get enough from food, i personally dont/ would want a little more of anyways.

Vit C: with the loss of my intra workout orange juice (RIP) i am going to fall behind on vitamin C without either eating oranges or taking a supplement. last thing i want in prep is to get sick, so ill be having a few grams of vit C a day.  

Carnitine: i go with oral carnitine as im just not feeling like pinning even more often. yes its less bioavailable and probably doesnt work quite the same but idc, its good enough for me. 4g orally daily. used for endurance, fat loss, and androgen cell upregulation (making my gear more effective essentially). 

Caffeine: really not a supplement as supplements are extra stuff you take, i think i would actually die without caffeine. 100mg upon waking (half a pill), coffee with meal 1, coffee after meal 3. later on ill probably be pounding bangs like theyre going out of style.

**ANCILLAIRES**

Cialis: probably in the same category as caffeine at this point, thing is amazing. besides the obvious erection benefits, the prostate health, slight blood pressure control, pumps in the gym, and androgen receptor activity/aromatase activity are all just amazing benefits. seriously its insane how great this thing is. 10mg every other day for me. 

That concludes the current draft plan, on to some random tidbits idk where to put in elsehwere

**Miscellaneous**

**BODY FAT:** [Got a Dexa Scan!](https://imgur.com/a/W52fbqU) first one ever, helped me get an idea of where im at and how much fat i need to lose. if im judging it right, i should lose about 15lbs of fat which at my rough target weight puts me at 6% bf which is probably as good as ill get this contest prep. thats 1lb of FAT a week which i think is doable over the course of this prep. funny story about the dexa, they had to mirror 1 arm to the other side because i was too wide to fit within the scanning area so my other arm gets cut off slightly on the scan.  ill do a 2nd dexa near the end, but everything inbetween i have a much more simple method for tracking body fat levels.

9 Site Caliper Reading: 56mm (7.04%). the actual % doesnt matter at all, the only thing that matters is the millimeters. the goal is to get as close to 30mm as possible. now some of the sites that i hold more fat on arent there so some weeks it might stay stagnant as i lose fat in those areas (like hamstrings/glutes). thats fine, but this is my objective measure of progress and should be trending down the whole time.

**Weakpoints**: yes, i am aware i have lagging body parts (chest, back thickness, etc). unless you have a magical way to improve them in a steep caloric deficit, telling me what im lagging is worse than useless. 

**Strength**: dont care about it, just trying to hold on to whatever lifts i can with whatever weight i can muster.

**Posing**: really need a mirror for these check ins because i can see small things i need to adjust, particularly for some reason without a mirror i dont open up me left lat.  still working on some posing but tbh i feel pretty good with where its at. practicing some slight variations to poses as well to see how they look but wont have a better idea until i lean out more.

**Hair:** its going and its going quick. ill probably be bald by the end of contest prep but i made my choice. im still struggling internally with letting it go tho.

All in all, im pretty excited and nervous to get this going. Thank you to everyone and i hope to continue to bring you great content in the future. you guys know im fully transparent with this stuff and it goes to say, please dont just copy my drug use and think thats how it works. it doesnt. just dont do drugs, theyre bad for you.

ofignz,weightroom,[MEET REPORT] Strongman Cannonade <220lbs Open 7/3/21,"This was a lot of fun! I have now done 3 strongman comps -- my first novice show at this same gym -- The Gym at Westminster, MD -- in December 2020, then Delaware's Strongest in April, and felt decently prepared going into this. 

Went into this pretty confident I wouldn't zero anything, and just wanted to get some more competition experience. I was most nervous about the log, since I've only been training with a log  for about two months, and there was a last minute event change from Fingal Fingers to a no tacky stone series, neither of which I had any experience with. Huge thanks to my wife for watching the toddler and infant by herself for five hours so I could do my weird hobby. And very cool to come away with winning my class!

Videos here:  [https://imgur.com/a/qrITEWl](https://imgur.com/a/qrITEWl) 

Training was pretty straightforward -- doing my second run through of SBS RTF 4x per week, with roughly a half hour on Saturday to practice strongman -- typically log and some sandbag loading. Just general strength focus, no particular peak for this show, though I did move the deload from week 7 to week 10 -- so I took a full rest week after 9 straight before this. Wasn't feeling too beat up, but was having trouble hitting 220lbs on the log until the week of the show once my fatigue started receding -- that was cool to see what was happening as the weights got easier and easier as I just practiced technique before the competition. 

I was a little nervous about making weight -- different scales said different things. Ours had a number of readings over 220, so I cut out my morning creatine and shake a few weeks out. Then the in-laws' scale was like 4lbs lighter than the one at home which gave me (in retrospect, a little too much) confidence. Morning before breakfast at home I weighed 218, and tipped the scales at 217 at the comp after some oatmeal and coffee. 

First event was duck walk, and a pretty light one at only 275lbs. I think this may be the silliest I've looked in a decent while. I took second by 6 hundredths of a second over 3rd, a second and a half behind first. Felt controlled, not too challenging, just unwieldy -- wish it were heavier. 

Next was max log. Again, pretty nervous. I had touched a log for the first time at my last comp, and was worried different implements would be totally different, etc. So opened conservatively at 200, then 230, then 250. One other guy attempted 250 but had just made 240 which I think took some out of him. Event win.

Then max deadlift on the elephant bar. This was essentially just pulling from blocks, which is not my strongest. There was not a terrible amount of whip at the top, was just kind of weird having it so light in the hands until the bar stopped bending and the weights actually started moving. I think I made an error of going too slowly, feeling out where the slack ended, and then not driving as explosively as I would for a deadlift from the floor. Debated a lot about moving my opener down to 495, but decided against it. Ended up winning the event though two others also made 585 since it was my second. Couldn't get 635 off the ground, though cool to see the individual plates come off one at a time. Probably also didn't push to the absolute max since I already had the event win, but I still really want a 600lbs pull. 

Next was stones which I had never done before. Given 9 stones and 90 seconds, split times taken after each and no tacky since last minute addition. I lapped two stones way earlier in the day for practice and felt OK about it since it felt pretty similar to a sandbag. But in my head I was just using my log cues, which were to try to crush the stone against my chest and clean with it high on my torso. This lead to my arms being pretty bent which is probably not the best. But I got the 7th stone over the bar, listed 267lbs and the heaviest lifted all day. I got second with the guy following me beating my time on the 7th stone by 5 seconds, and only one other heavy got the 7th as well. I would love any comments on what I should be doing better here (or on any of the events). Definitely still figuring this out.

Sandbag loading I was in a comfortable lead, and again, it was pretty light and short distance -- I think only ten feet. Stayed pretty controlled -- guy before me had a bag drop off the barrel which sucked. 130, 170 and 220lbs bags back and forth, my time was 17.5 seconds, for second place by 0.6 seconds.

I had a lot of fun. I'm signed up for their Gran Prix format, which will score folks across four comps in four months -- so now I'm trying to figure out how to slot my training into a lot of competitions. Part of me would like a taper and a recovery weak around each show, but that means I'm only training 50% of weeks, which doesn't sound right. Hopefully I figure something out! Jumping straight back into SBS RTF this week has not been a roaring success -- definitely sore back and forearms from the competition even 5 days later. 

Happy lifting!",2021-07-07 13:02:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/ofignz/meet_report_strongman_cannonade_220lbs_open_7321/
o724tc,weightroom,[Program Review] 5/3/1 SSL + BBS,"**INTRO**

Hi lifty pals, I am a regular in fittit and have had a great experience with running 5/3/1 SSL + BBS for quite a few cycles.  I have been lifting seriously now for about 2 years.  I began lifting in late 2018 using the Reddit PPL and once I couldn't progress on LP anymore, I hopped on 5/3/1 for beginners and haven't looked back from 5/3/1.  I have completed the following templates (most of them for multiple cycles): BBB, BBS, FSL (all kinds of iterations such as using widowmakers, jokers, etc), SSL, 5x5/3/1, SVR II, God is a Beast, Pervertor, and BTM.  After running all of these, I can safely say SSL + BBS has given me the most consistent progress which I will explain below.

**RESULTS**

Starting stats: 27, male, 5'7, 165lbs

Current stats: Still 27, male, and 5'7 but 170lbs

Length of program: 5 cycles

I rarely ever test 1RM so I will provide TMs (85% TM is used for SSL + BBS):

&#x200B;

|Squat|Bench|OHP|Deadlift|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|275 start, 325 now|235 start, 260 now|150 start, 175 now|370 start, 420 (heh) now|

Note: The reason the squat TM is so poor is because I had a groin injury where I couldn't squat for 9 months but that has since healed, just working my way back up now.

**ROUTINE**

I love programs with large amounts of volume on the big 4 and minimal accessories so SSL + BBS was an easy choice once I actually found it in Forever; I must have glanced over it the multiple times I read through the book.  The program is set up to have you doing 5s PRO and SSL for one lift, then 10x5 FSL for another lift (Squat + Bench and OHP + Deadlift).  Each day you will perform 18 working sets of the big 4 (8 sets from 5s PRO and SSL and 10 sets from the BBS).  

Accessories on this template, by Jim's recommendation, are limited to face pulls, curls, and pull-ups so I stuck to these.  I broke it up and did 5 sets of curls and 5 sets of face pulls on Bench and OHP BBS days and I did 5x10 chin ups on Squat and Deadlift BBS days.  

Even as I added weight after every cycle appropriately, I never felt like any set was a grind, even the 5 rep sets at 95%.  The 5 rep set at 95% when my TM was 235 for bench felt just as easy as my 5 rep set at 95% at a TM of 260.  That's how I knew progress was great with this program.

**WHAT I CHANGED**

The program can be done 4 times a week or 3 times a week, with Jim's recommendation on 3 times a week for the extra recovery.  I decided to meet in the middle at 3.5 times a week.  I would lift every other day (so week 1 would be sunday, tuesday, thursday, and saturday then week 2 was monday, wednesday, friday, then repeat).  In the days between lifting, I would do conditioning.  My conditioning was either incline walking on a treadmill (3.2 speed, 10 incline for 20-30 mins) or jump roping for 20 mins.  I felt that breaking it up so that it was lift, condition, lift, condition was a great way to get that active recovery in and still be lifting enough.

Additionally, since I was lifting every other day I decided to do core work every lifting day although Gym Wendler didn't recommend it.  I just choose 5 sets of either hanging leg raises or ab wheel to end my sessions.  

**DIET**

I chose to include diet close to the end because I'm a boring eater, haha.  My breakfast is always a black coffee, Oikos triple zero yogurt, and a protein shake all adding up to 67g of protein.  My lunch is whatever I had for dinner the night before and my dinner is always some sort of meat (usually chicken), rice, and a green vegetable.  I aim for 160g of protein a day and supplement with protein bars if need be.

During this \~18 week process, I was finishing a cut for the first few weeks (got down to like 165) then I bulked back up to 175 by the end, putting on about 1lb/week.  I honestly felt no difference in energy between cutting and bulking on this program and felt my recovery was great for both.  

**WHAT WOULD I CHANGE?**

Against Jim's wishes, I did this leader cycle for 5 weeks straight instead of 3 but I was progressing so well I didn't want to change.  I'm doing a deload week now and am hopping onto FSL with AMRAPs for 2 cycles as an anchor but moving forward I'm going to do 3 cycles of SSL + BBS then 2 cycles of FSL with AMRAPs so I can track my PR sets more consistently.

njje6d,weightroom,"[Meet Report] Unleash the Beast - Puyallup, WA, USA (690kg @ 90.8kg, 19M)","This was my first ever competition after ~4 years of lifting and 3 years of power lifting. I've never been a competitive guy, but I recently saw the USAPL record for Teen III in Washington, and thought to myself *""I could totally nail that""*. I only have a few more months of being 19, so I said screw it and signed up for the event.


**Background & Training**

I train for fun, and generally hop off a program when it starts to bore me. For the past six months or so, I have been using a rough mental template of Greyskull LP. As a freshman in college who works nearly full time, between socializing, studying, and my job I really do not have as much time to train as I used to, so I like the flexibility that comes with the program. It's efficacy is also proved, and if done correctly it can produce solid results. I honestly can't write out my programming because it's practically always improvised, but I strictly follow the pyramid that is advocated for in the program.


**Leading Up to the Meet**

I am not going to lie, I did not peak or do anything correctly prep wise. As a matter of fact about three weeks from the meet, I got pretty bored of training so I took a week off and just rock climbed and ran. I was about to pull out of the meet just because I was losing focus in my training and wanted a break from it all for a bit. However, about two weeks out, I got back on the path and resumed being calculated in the gym. I hit heavy triples and doubles, and kept my diet in check. One week out I hit heavy singles in all of my lifts, and about three days out I realized *""Oh shit, I need to weigh in at 93kg and I'm at 95""*. This is when I began my first ever cut in my life, and it was actually pretty easy. I just cut back on actual food volume two days out, and didn't drink or eat anything for about 14 hours one day out. I ended up cutting too hard though, and weighed in at 90.8kg which was far lighter than I thought thanks to my garbage scale at home. The day before the meet I also hit light singles while cutting just to 
get my mind right.


**Meet Day**

I woke up a dehydrated mess, and my buddy who was gonna be my coach for the day picks me up. I drink a black coffee, weigh in, and a cram a Gatorade and a massive plate of ground beef and rice in me. From weigh in's to platform time I had about two hours, so I got as much in me as possible. I also felt good, like the best I have felt in months, and just knew I was going to crush it. I slammed a couple energy drinks and went to work.


**Squats (3/3 235/245/257.5)**

All I can say is damn, squats felt good and set the tone for the rest of the meet. I felt like a hydraulic press, and scored a 16.5lb PR!

[257.5kg on video.](https://streamable.com/t065jv)


**Bench (2/3 150/160/165 [x])**

Overall wasn't tremendously happy with bench, but it moved fine and I was able to hit a bench that was just shy of my PR. My third attempt was very close, but I just couldn't get it up there. Oh well.

[160kg on video.](https://streamable.com/vt0vwq)


**Deadlift (2/3 266/272.5/280 [x])**

Oh deadlifts, my absolute favorite movement on earth. About a month ago I pulled 611lb, and after that I just did not go heavy except for a 585lb single a week out. Coming in, I was terrified I was gonna botch my opener, but I managed to secure it, and even tipped over 600lb which I was mighty happy about considering my lackluster prep and fatigue from the prior lifts.

[272.5kg on video.](https://streamable.com/o8uspl)


**Results and the Future**

Overall, I am freaking stoked. My first competition was a ton of fun and I managed to get the state record total for my division and weight. Plus I got a cool little medal. There is no doubt in my mind I could have performed far better if I put in more work these past couple of months, but I am at a point in my life where powerlifting just is not the most important thing going on. I don't regret my choices at all because in all honesty this year has been the most fruitful year of my life. I am at a place where powerlifting is going to take a backseat for a while, and this competition was a nice little send-off to serious lifting for the time being. 

I sincerely hope nobody reads this post and thinks I am advocating going into a meet with garbage prep, because I am not. This was just my little story about an event I signed up for on a whim.

Going forward I am going to be rock climbing a ton, backpacking, and I am planning on running a half marathon pretty soon. I'm sure my numbers will go down, but when I am ready I will be back, and the barbell will be right where I left it.",2021-05-23 22:48:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/njje6d/meet_report_unleash_the_beast_puyallup_wa_usa/
n8e1dq,weightroom,[Program Review] Barbell Medicine's The Bridge 1.0,"First things first: stats (pounds). TL;DR - excellent program, great intro to RPE training. Added 100lbs to my S/B/D/OHP while maintaining weight and making modest physique gains.


Stat| Before| After| Delta
---|---|----|---
**Age** | 30 | 30 | +0
**Height** | 5'9""| 5'9""| +0

**OHP** | 142 e1RM | 156 e1RM, 3x135@8 actual | +15
**Total** | 767 | 868 | +101

My Deadlift e1RM peaked at 396 one week in the middle of the program. I think this was due to aggressive RPE gauging coupled with just a really good day in the gym.

**Goal:**

I wanted to complete this program to increase my overall strength in the big 4 lifts: Squat, Bench, Deadlift, OHP. I wanted to preferentially increase my bench, as I think my press is pretty strong already. 

**Training History:**

I’ve been training with barbells off and on for about a decade with varying levels of success and consistency. Most of my training history has been 5x5, 5/3/1, Phraks Greyskull, and similar programs. My lack of consistency stems primarily from program hopping and chasing multiple goals at once. I also found out during the pandemic that I have a chronic autoimmune disease which causes me a lot of fatigue and other problems. Having treatment for this has allowed me to be extremely consistent with my training, and the results show it.

**Program & Results:**

I found BBM by way of Alan Thrall. I think most folks here are familiar with them, so I won’t go into detail here. The Bridge 1.0 is designed as a free post Starting Strength Novice Linear Progression program. It’s an introduction to autoregulated, RPE-based training. It took a little calibration, but I feel a lot more comfortable rating my effort level now than I did at the beginning of the program, which obviously comes with practice.

The program is straightforward: 3 lifts a day, 3 days a week and 1-2 GPP days. I usually lifted Monday/Wednesday/Friday. You can read the full details on the BBM website.

I completed all prescribed strength sessions in the program, but I missed quite a few GPP sessions. I do think completing the GPP sessions would have resulted in squeezing a little more out of the program. I also switched from high bar to low bar squatting, so that may skew my squat results a bit.

The workouts can be a bit long, but by staying focused and limiting rest periods, most of my sessions were about 60-75 minutes total. The more training I did, the shorter my warmups needed to be as well, so that helped decrease the total time in the gym. I don't particularly like the time-oriented AMRAP style programming for accessory/GPP work. The Bridge has you do 7min AMRAP upper back work and 7min core work 1-2x a week, which feels like an afterthought. Toward the end of the program, I ended up doing a double progression adding sets then reps week-over-week, which is an idea I got from Greg Nuckols' SBS program builder. I definitely prefer this style of accessory work. Since changing to this method, I find the GPP work a lot more interesting and adherence has gone up significantly.

The Bridge also introduced me to a lot of new variations of barbell work that I hadn’t really done in a focused way. I really enjoyed paused squats and pin bench. I loved/hated tempo squats; I think they’re great for time under tension and building quality technique under the bar. Overall, the workouts were really fun for me, but do require a lot of focus. I'm used to training sessions including 1-2 main lifts and multiple accessories. I really enjoy doing 3 ""big"" lifts or a variation each day, and then having a focused accessory session.

**Diet & Supplements:**

I ate decently well. Cooked nearly everything at home and tracked protein intake and overall calories most days. I missed a few days of tracking here and there for various reasons. Obviously, I was at maintenance over the course of the program, with some weeks/days being a deficit and some being a surplus, which I think served me pretty well. I rarely eat meat, so my diet consisted of things like eggs, oatmeal, rice, greek yogurt, tofu, beans, lentils, homemade bread, and other mostly whole foods. I more or less ate to satiety, about 3-4 meals per day and a post workout whey shake most days. My meal construction is consistent, so the meals I eat tend to be around 600-800 calories, with the occasional indulgence. I estimate I ate around 2600-2700 calories/day on average, and aimed for about 125-150g protein. I eat most meals with my family, so I have pretty regularly have meals I don't track for convenience reasons. Supplements included 5g creatine daily in my morning coffee, whey protein usually post workout, turmeric/curcumin, vitamin D, and fish oil. I don’t know how much these supps helped, but some of them are prescribed by my doctor and aren’t too expensive so I just keep on them daily and have done for years.

**Summary:**

I highly recommend this program. I'm really pleased with my progression in lifts. I have made noticeable physique changes, despite it not being my primary goal. I feel leaner and more muscular. My technique in my lifts feels rock solid. I personally love the RPE system. I still get to plan my progression much of the time, but it allows me some mental space for flexibility in my weight selection for the day. After all, it’s just one training session; it’s not a performance. Logging all my sessions allowed me to visualize the daily fluctuation in training and the general trend upward, which helps me trust the process. It’s a lot easier to accept not progressing week over week when you look back and see the cumulative effect of several weeks of training.

**Next Steps:**

I signed up for a meet later this summer, so I’m going to run BBM’s Powerlifting II into that. This will be my first ever competition, and mostly I decided to do it because I’ve always wanted to compete in some type of strength competition and 2020 sucked so much I decided to stop putting it off. Since it’s my first meet, I don’t have a lot of expectations and am doing it casually just to test myself. I’m looking for that 2/3/4 plate total, which is something I’ve always wanted for completely arbitrary reasons. I’m currently about 10-20 pounds from those numbers on all my lifts, so I think that’s a pretty conservative goal. I’m also going to prioritize completing all the GPP workouts this time around and I plan to eat at maintenance and compete in the 82.5kg class. I’m hoping to lean out a bit and decrease my waist circumference, but the top priorities for now are completing all my workouts, staying healthy, and competing at the end of the summer.",2021-05-09 13:15:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/n8e1dq/program_review_barbell_medicines_the_bridge_10/
mn1p4j,weightroom,Back from a Bad Break: Review of Deep Water Beginner,"(Cross posted from xxfitness)

**Intro**

(F) 5’7” 179lbs. I haven’t seen many reviews by women on Jon Andersen’s [Deep Water Method](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/#Barbell_Compound_Lift_Focused_Routines). I injured myself in January, and after I was cleared by my doctor, I ran this program to recover my strength and build my confidence back up.

TLDR:  program kicked my ass, I liked changing up the progression scheme from increasing weight to reducing rest time, and I’m back to where I was pre-injury. 

**Background**

Sedentary office worker checking in. Five years ago, I started concentrating on powerlifting, but have been off and on with exercise in general, trying to balance work and a new relationship. During pandemic, I did no strength training until September when I built my home gym. I ran the Beginner 5/3/1 program, followed by nSuns 4 day. Squat/Bench/Deadlift actual maxes at the start on 2021 were 190lb/145lb/240lb, all for 2 reps. OHP was 90lb for 3.  

Unfortunately, in early January, I slipped on my carpeted(!) stairs, carrying a bowl of cereal, and ended up in the ER with two fractures and a sliced-up pinky.  Luckily (if you can get lucky in the context of breaking your body on some stupid stairs), it was mostly just painful and scary, nothing long term.  By mid-Feb, my doctor cleared me to resume my normal activities, including lifting, but to avoid contact sports and falling down more stairs.

**Program**

I think everyone here is familiar with the program but just in case, for DW Beginner, Days 1 and 3 are 10 sets of 10 reps of either squat or deadlift, and 10x10 of OHP or push press. Days 2 and 4 are 3x10 of back exercises including cleans and AMRAP pull-ups, and 3x10 of bench variations and AMRAP push-ups and dips. Day 5 is 20 minutes of conditioning. The lifting days also include core exercises of sit-ups, 1min planks and/or back extensions. Weight is set at 54% of your tested max. 

DW Beginner progresses by reducing rest times by a minute every two weeks, starting with a max of 4 minutes.

You can get a free copy of the e-book by giving your email on [Jon Andersen’s website](https://www.deepwatermethod.com/free/ ) or it’s available for $10 off Amazon. (Note he also offers a 3-month DW weight training method for $180, which is different). 

**Goals**

I’ve wanted run DW for a while based on the reviews on here and on r/fitness. I wimp out on AMRAPs and was hoping to build  up my stamina when lifting.

Post-injury, I wanted to recover my strength and my confidence in putting heavy loads on my back after spending the start of 2021 feeling weak and helpless and freaking out over every minor twitch. I also hoped to return to my previous maxes, but that was a secondary goal.

**Modifications**

My total dips and pull-ups are all low, so I switched to bench dips, and pull-ups immediately followed by bench assisted pull-ups for more volume. I braced against a barbell for back extensions since I don’t have a machine. I also switched the sit-ups to Russian twists after I tweaked my neck the first week. 

For personal preference reasons, I did the 10x10 deadlifts with a trap bar, and all OHP and push press with an axle bar. 

Conditioning was mostly running up and down a hill or a HIIT spin class. 

I actually emailed Jon Andersen some questions about my modifications, and to my surprise, he wrote back. Since I’ve never had clean pulls in my programming before, I was initially considering using a lower weight and relying on my lighter axle bar. He pointed out that I would probably be inhabited my grip and wouldn’t get the full benefit of the exercise. So I sucked it up and used a regular barbell, then surprised myself by going up to 95lb. 

Finally, I really tried to keep to the 5-consecutive-day format but had a couple of weeks with an unintentional rest day midweek due to work. I also made first day of my period a rest day. 

**Diet**

This program made me eat. I went from drinking coffee only in the morning to waking up hungry. Breakfasted consistently for the first time in my life, ignored any sort of calorie restriction, and actually tried to meet my protein goals for once (aimed for 130-140g/day). Weight fluctuated up and down but generally is back to where it was pre injury.  

The recommended diet in the ebook is five meals a day of high quality, organic protein, fats and leafy greens (Jon Andersen is anti-carb, safe to say). I initially wasn’t going to make any dietary changes, but since the program aims to remove easy recovery methods like carbs and rest days to challenge yourself further, I gave up my regular quick carbs like cereal and chips, and tried not to eat before or during the workout. However, fruits and beans were still a regular part of my diet, and I occasionally ate bread and sugar. 

I also drank but had some success dialing that down by switching to Athletic Brewing NA beers.

**Farts**

They were bad.

**Physique**

I purposefully did not take progress photos because I wanted to focus on recovery. However, my SO started calling me to [Geodude](https://imgur.com/a/Lv2QOSO), so I guess you could say I reached peak physique with this program.  

**Experience**

I went from 4 minutes of rest between each set to 2 minutes of rest for:

+10x10 back squats: 100lb

+10x10 trap bar deadlifts: 165lbs

+10x10 OHP: 60lbs

+10x10 Push Press: 80lbs

+3x10 Clean Pulls: 95lbs

+3x10 Bench Press: 95lbs 
 
My workouts averaged 75-90 minutes at the start to 40-60 minutes towards the end.

I’m now a week into running nSuns again, and I’m back to where I was in January. (To be clear, I am not suggesting this program “healed” me, just that it allowed me to regain my confidence in putting heavy loads on my back).

More importantly, the program kicked my ass, and I had a great time running it. Most days, I ended each session feeling spent, HR in the cardio zone, and like I could not do another rep with a knife to my belly. Reps weren’t always pretty but the program really teaches you to push while still in recovery. (Only failed twice and reracked once during a set when I smacked myself in the jaw on a push press. Honestly, the overhead pressing was consistently an asshole to me the entire program, but I have now gone from 90lbs for 3 to 95lbs for 3). By the 5th week, I had mostly forgotten that I had this back injury, and I feel prepared to tackle whatever is next.

Before this, if I had to design my nightmare program, it would probably include high rep squats at warm up weight, mandatory conditioning, planks and only benching once a week. Certainly, two weeks in, I was wondering why I decided to go from feeling bad from not moving and eating too much sugar to feeling bad from DOMS and overeating. But DOMS started to subside, I figured out how to eat less like a dumbass, and I was never bored (hard to feel bored when you are always slightly afraid of the next set). The 10x10 were so much easier on my joints than heavy reps, I loved how simple it was, and I certainly got better at pushing myself when the chance of failure is very real. 

My only change personally would be starting with a 60-65% estimate for the weight rather than 54%. I began with 54% of my January maxes (rather than the estimated max), assuming that being out of commission for 6 weeks would make those numbers safe. I went up in everything except squat, and I regret not increasing my squat—it’s the only lift that doesn’t feel as solid now at higher weights, and I think grinding at a higher weight would have helped. I’d like to lose CV19 weight first, but I plan to run this again and will probably target what I feel comfortable doing for 3x10.

**Final Thoughts**

DW definitely targets men (email and ebook littered with talk like ‘this program will cause most men to break’, ‘don’t be a p****y’, that sort of thing. Email even addressed me as “my brother” 😂). But like the majority of lifting programs aimed at men it seems, DW is equal opportunity for anyone comfortable performing the movements. I ended up rereading the ebook a couple of times because the mental aspect of lifting isn’t something I’ve thought about a lot, and I appreciated learning about his thoughts and background. 

Really, I’m just pro any program that challenges my preconceived notions of what I like or can do. And to go from lying in bed, dependent on someone else for basic needs, to pressing 80lbs over my head 100 times is something I am very grateful for.

Finally, thank you to those who wrote reviews of DW—found them immensely helpful.",2021-04-08 21:14:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/mn1p4j/back_from_a_bad_break_review_of_deep_water/
lkmoy3,weightroom,[Program Review] Myocyte Maturation or How to periodize for enhanced bodybuilding.,"Grab a cup of coffee cuz this is a long one.

A program review that isnt SBS/RP/Smolov! Thats a new one! This is for **bodybuilding** purposes and i know a majority of you train for strength, but i enjoy the training discussions on this sub so i thought this would be a great place for this. 

First and foremost: [My spreadsheet for the program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M_jHTwCj6ZvwE9weGWqvtoXchAVCy6cnMjL8TOS9JeA/edit?usp=sharing) which includes the podcast episode this program is based off of by Alex Kikel. The guts of this program is pretty much set up how its described, but I made adjustments based off how I like to train and taking things i learned that work for me through many years of different programs. Particularly big influences in this are John Meadows, Broderick Chavez, Justin Harris, Joe Bennett, and Mike Israetel. 

For those that dont want to waste their time listening to the podcast, its rather simple and i shall write it out.

**Phase 1**:**Alarm/Glycolytic Upregulation (Volume Accumulation)**. You start at 80 sets a week and add 5 sets a week until you reach peak volume of 120 sets. Load only increases when designated reps are hit on all sets.

**Phase 2: Alactic Improvement (""Strength"" Block)**. Priority is to increase load as often as possible, rather than reach the top end of rep scheme. 

**Phase 3: Myocyte Maturation (""Intensity"" Block).** Added drop sets throughout the rest of the training block. Work through rep ranges again rather than prioritizing load.

All of this is accomplished throughout 16 weeks, followed either by a deload and a restructure or how im going through it with a ""bridge."" More on this later. Alex Kikel used big science words and biology and physiology to come up with how the training program is worded and set up, but i think it really can just be named more simply with the terms i put in parentheses. He also puts a disclaimer in his podcast that he knows hes not using the words exactly correctly but it gets his point across of what theyre trying to achieve, just in case anyone was about to have a hissy fit about the terminology which is also why i just think my terms leave less headache.


**Background Info:**

Age: 29, training since 21 so about 8 years on the dot today. 

Height: 5'10, but used to say i was 6' back in college. 

Start of blast: 300mg/600mg/3ius Test/Deca/GH (M-F only)

Mid Blast: 250mg/600mg/50mg/2ius Test/Deca/Adrol/GH (M-F only)

End Blast: 250mg/600mg/300mg/2ius Test/Deca/Mast/GH (M-F only)

Graduated high school at 130lbs, was an XC and track runner. i was not gifted for bodybuilding. did basic beginner programs, moved onto PHUL/PHAT, tried to be strong in powerlifting, didnt enjoy it, switched to bodybuilding and realized i lied to myself about wanting to be strong, i only cared about how i looked.

Now for the only thing that matters: 

**RESULTS**

Starting Weight: 201lbs

Highest Morning Weigh in: 222.8lbs

Final Average Weight: 220.6lbs

As seen above, you got an idea of what the general outline looked like. Now the way this program worked is that since your limited in volume, your pretty much forced to choose how to allocate it. This is something i dont think a lot of intermediate bbers understand. you can only recover from so much total volume, so why are you wasting it on the muscle groups you grow easily/are strong points? For me, i wanted to really bring up my chest and back so i put more volume in them, and less in my legs which respond very well to low volume. i didnt think i put that much volume in my arms which i later realized i probably couldve dropped that some more, and my delts grow with nothing so i just set a little aside for them. How you choose to put volume is based on your own physique and experience, which makes this program great for customizing to your own needs.

**On Frequency:** There is only so much productive work you can do before it would be better to move more to another day. What this number is, idk its probably variable person to person. for me? i discovered that at least for back, 15 sets a day was too much. the last 3-5 sets i really didnt feel like i was getting more out of my training. there was no more extra pump, no more insane contractions, just fatigue. My next macrocycle i will be moving back to 3 days a week simply to make each set 100% productive. not all muscles need tons of frequency, that is just for you to discover for yourself. 

**On RIR/RPE/Intensity:** too many terms for this when it comes to bodybuilding. pretty much, 95%+ of my sets were taken between hard and really really hard. thats all that fucking mattered. i would say about 75%+ of my sets were taken to failure. not frothing at the mouth screaming at the top of your lungs failure, just bodybuilding failure. my tempo for the lift is gone and i have to cheat a good amount to do another rep? yea no, sets over i failed. almost every single exercise and every single rep had a 2-5 second negative, full control at the bottom (maybe not a full second pause, but maybe a slight one or at least no bouncing) and a contraction at the peak. It would make a lot of sense to leave some in the tank in the first couple weeks and slowly progress to failure and then keep pushing it each week, but i just tried as hard as i could constantly because if i am constantly giving it my full effort, i have 1 less variable to fuck with. 

**On Volume:** im sure some people will think thats not a lot of volume. for some im sure it isnt, but i think for most people who train properly hard and actually make progress, this should be about enough give or take 5-10 sets. im sure plenty of people also do tons more volume but never track a single lift or only track the 1 barbell movement. it would be pretty easy to do more volume when your not paying attention if your actually progressing every lift or not. if you dont want to track everything thats fine i get it, but at the same time that also means you dont know if your actually doing effective volume or not. as for why the arbitrary 80-120 sets? im sure the people who made this program or things similar have just found through their own coaching and through history of lifting that it seems to be perfectly fine. If you look at a few popular programs youd probably find a decent amount have volumes similar to this. I do know that quite a lot of john meadows programs have more volume than this, but the intensities are waved so you should be able to do more volume with lower intensities. 

**On Exercise Selection and Order, and Program Split:** The best part of the program. choose the ones you get the absolute most out of as far as MMC/progress/pumps/etc. thats it. pretty straight forward and leaves a lot of room to do what you can with what you have. Typically i think the program is supposed to stay stagnant with exercise selection, but i changed as needed either because of injury, found something that looked awesome and felt better, or the exercise i was doing didnt feel like it was doing anything so i swapped it. as for the order, you should do the muscle groups your trying to bring up first in the workout, and then whatever else in the day after. THIS MEANS IF YOUR TRYING TO BRING UP YOUR ARMS, YOU DO ARM WORK FIRST. i dont get why this is hard for people to get. if you have a great chest and shit tris, why are you doing chest first and then tris when theyre fatigued? ""well then my chest workout would suffer!"" fucking GOOD! your chest doesnt fucking matter when its overpowering and your trying to bring up your arms! drop the ego, and do the work properly. as for the split, i dont think it ultimately matters all that much. i just chose to set it up how i liked, which was 5x a week, PPLPP. this aligned with all of my goals for the program, but going forward thatll change to a 6 day split where i have back 3x a week, chest 2x, and legs 1x. choose however you want and split it however you want, just remember the volume your doing and to be smart about it. tons of lower back work the day before your leg day filled with squats and RDLs is probably stupid. 

**THE DRUGS:**

The literal whole point of this training. this aligns perfectly with what a typical cycle should look like for a bulk/offseason physique ""athletes."" 16 weeks of long esters (theres a time and place for short esters, imo an offseason mass gaining phase is not one of them) and as the drugs saturate, the volume goes up. there is some biological processes that goes on behind the scenes as drugs come in and start to saturate (which is why i dont think frontloading/short esters is a great idea for this) and the training helps with that as well. the way it was described was this: imagine your trying to expand a community (build more muscle). you dont just start bringing all of the concrete and wood and piping and shit for the houses, you dont even have a fucking road yet. first the road comes, and then the telephone poles for electricity, and then the pavement, and then the property needs a base, and then its built, and THEN you have expanded the community. there ya go, we know muscle building is a slow process so slamming tons of drugs right from the get go, probably not helpful. so let the drugs build up, let the volume build up, and be patient. 

**On Drug Choices:** This should be pretty straightforward. choose the drug you need based off your personal side effects/wanted effects/training/availability. if tren leaves you out of breath, doing high volume work might be a little difficult. if your a skinny small kind of guy, maybe using a volumizing drug like nand would be a good idea. if you need to do extra cardio but dont need more fullness, maybe EQ/tbol is your go to. you get the picture, just using random drugs cuz they sound cool is bad form imo. 

**On My Drug Choices and Adjustments:** heres how it went. started with the test/deca/gh to build volume and fullness since im small. i dont get issues with deca dick, but i do get issues with high e2 from test so i wanted to keep that down. i personally dont think using ai to combat high test is a good idea. it makes much more sense to me to just use less test, and utilize a different anabolic to take its place. ive used deca before so i knew how to handle that, and i decided to give GH a run to help keep me leaner and to open up more pathways of anabolism. After a little bit, still felt high e2 symptoms so i dropped test to 250mg. Then i did some math and decided to drop gh to 2ius. didnt notice a difference and now it was easier to just use 1 vial a week, plus now i only need 1 kit to have enough for 2ius my whole next blast as well. Now for the next drug choice. Entering the strength phase, i think its a good time to introduce a short acting drug thatll aid that. i went with adrol cuz i wanted to see if i could actually hold more fullness or not, for the strength gains, and it doesnt aromatize. i would only take 50mg pre workout, had 0 appetite issues. what i did get was gyno. im assuming between the deca, adrol, and gh, too much nipple progesterone shit was going on. dropped the adrol after 3 weeks, and decided to replace it with mast. helpful for strength gains, and helps with the gyno. it was a pretty simple win win, and with some nolva and then ralox my gyno has significantly reduced. 

**On Side Effects:** 19-nors love to give me puffy nipples, but adding the adrol gave me actual lump growth behind the nipple. The puffiness disappears when the 19-nors clear so if your like me, dont freak out about your nips til you feel actual lumps growing. My hair has been getting fucked for a long time now, i really dont care too much at this point. i use some minox cuz i have it but thats all. i got very very minor amounts of pimples once the mast came in, but other than that i was mostly clear. for those wondering, my chest is all scars from a horrible bout of cystic acne that i had on me for a year straight. dont listen to the fear mongering about accutane. if you have legit cystic acne, go straight to accutane do not pass go. topical retinol didnt help, changing shirts/showers/shower wash was bullshit, doxycycline didnt do anything, minocycline helped a little, accutane cleared it insanely fast. but after a year of constant cystic acne and popping and bleeding, the scars fucked me. back to this blast: fingernails grew faster, sometimes my arms would fall asleep while i laid in bed, i also snore like a mfer. other than that, i was good. no BP issues at all (120/76), no anger like tren, no depression, no insane water holding from gh. 

**On Bloodwork:** 

i got 3 bloodworks done this blast. the 1st was on my own, the 2nd was from my PCP, and the 3rd was from my nephrologist. my first blood work looked about what i expected, prolactin was low end of normal (thank you 100mg p5p), my HCT was elevated like always but was higher than i was comfortable with (53), my test on 250mg was 2k (but my pinning schedule was weird so its hard to say what it would look like if i did the typical 2 shots a week, wait 36-48 hours for bloods), e2 was 47, but most importantly my creatinine was high like always (1.76) and my egfr was 51. ive had high creatinine since my first ever blood work natty, and its been sitting in the 1.6-1.7 range for a couple years now, with my egfr floating between 50-60. finally decided fuck it, talk to the doc to make sure im ok (had 0 other symptoms). 

bloodwork 2: PCP bloods, CMP/UA/Lipids/Hepatic Function/A1C/TSH. once again creatining at 1.61, egfr 57. everything else in the CMP was normal. my UA? 100% clean. negative on protein in urine as well, not even trace. felt much better about that. felt a little worse when i saw my lipid panel but thats the cost of doing business, ive had not so great lipids since natty (total has been fine, just low HDL). a1c of 4.9 so GH wasnt fucking that up at least. tsh was fine.

regardless, bloodwork 3 from nephrologist: Uric Acid/A1C/Prot+CreatU/CBC/Vit D/Renal Panel. once again, 1.73 creatinine, 52 egfr. surprise surprise. rest of renal panel was fine. uric acid normal, A1C now 5.1 (still no issues from GH), and my first ever perfect CBC (finally got HCT in range). Vit D was 80, guess 6k ius was a little overkill. now the most important test, the Protein + Creatinine Urine test. both numbers completely normal. ratio was great as well. have a quick check in with the doc in 2 days, but i am breathing much easier for now. wife was never worried since i had 0 other symptoms, and all of my other health markers were normal. so when we tell you guys, creatinine isnt the best marker for us juicy lifters, keep my story in mind. dont ignore it, but dont feel like you are guaranteed to have CKD right now. in the future tho who knows. ill keep you guys posted.

**THE DIET:**

Pretty basic carb cycling. 3 high days, 2 medium days, 2 low days. at the start of the blast, the diet was split like this

low days: 2600Cals 195P/220C/105F

medium days: 3500Cals 237P/436C/91F

high days: 3750Cals 197P/626C/43F

these numbers changed down the road but i didnt track them too much, only knew what i was adding was on top of what i ate. a majority of my calories came from rice/chicken/beef/salmon. I trained at 4am, so i didnt eat prior. what i did do, was drink half a protein shake on wake (330a) and 100mg caffeine, and then had a carb drink intra (oj + dextrose + salt, 50g carbs on med days, 80g carbs on high day), finished my shake post workout, and then came home and ate within 30-60 minutes. meal 1 was always eggs/eggwhites, oats, milk for the oats, and if it was med/high day, a bagel, or bagel and toast. meals 2 and 3 were always chicken or salmon and rice, with spinach occasionally (im bad on veggies i know), meal 4 depended on the day for med/high. med days itd usually be cream of rice + whey + pb, high days chicken and rice, meal 5 on med days was beef and potatoes, on high days it was just fill out carbs for the day. usually was at minimum a package of poptarts, but i let this meal also be a cheat meal so id eat whatever i felt like tbh. this is why the cals are skewed, my high days typically were closer to 4100 cals at minimum. my avg weekly cals started at 3500/day, and ended around 3800/day. the low days brought the average down, as id only have 4 meals, and also no intra workout since low days were rest days. those days id either be really hungry, or they stopped being a low day. 

**On Carb Cycling:** Its not magic, its not the only way or the right way, it was just the way i enjoyed. i got days i got to eat tons and days i had to practice being hungry. one thing to note, i was consistently hungry. id eat just about every 3 hours, and would still be hungry by about the 2 hour mark on a lot of days. i was never like this before carb cycling, being a naturally skinny guy with low appetite. even on my previous blasts/bulks, id just have to force food down every single day, but every day was the same calorie goals. this way, i felt like i could still gain more and more while not feeling like a bloated full mess 24/7. i also ate clean for the most part. chicken/rice (covered in chicken stock) digests so insanely easy. if i try to eat dirty i lose all of my appetite for most of the day. bunch of donuts for the morning would have me not hungry til the afternoon, pizza or burrito for lunch would leave me missing a meal, so i didnt do those things. i was able to get in about 98% of my meals this bulk. the carb cycling played a big role in that for me. its not for everyone tho, having to double check what your having that day, adjusting food daily etc can be too tedious for people. thats completely understandable, but if its not a bother, i suggest giving it a shot.

**Miscellaneous Diet Stuff:**  be prepared. understand your day, and plan accordingly. if i was going to be gone extended time, id make sure to pack my meals. food jar to keep them warm, tupperwares already split per meal, etc. dont let yourself run out of food. always be wary of whats left and what you need to cook/buy. having back up meals is good too. did i butcher my day and now dont have rice or chicken? fuck it cream of rice + whey it is. i had 2 coffees a day, 1 with breakfast, 1 around 1-2pm. coffee is delicious. i put polynesian sauce on my chicken and rice (from chick-fil-a). made it taste infinitely better, worth the small calories in a bulk. chicken was seasoned with montreals chicken seasoning. beef was cooked with soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, sesame oil, garlic. did i count the calories in that? no, fuck that. its spread over 6-7lbs of beef, i doubt it was worth the trouble. plus it was consistent, the most important part. costco muffins are fucking delicious, and 700cals each which makes them kinda hard to justify often. pop tarts are goat. i never wanna hear anyone ever say they cant gain weight. if your eating whatever your eating consistently and not gaining weight, a package of pop tarts right before bed is literally all you need. its 70g of carbs and 400 cals, it turns a maintenance into a perfect bulk. its the easiest thing in the world to eat. salmon was always wild cuz i think its healthier and i have to lie to myself that i care about health while blasting drugs. 

**THE EXTRAS:** Cardio was about 45-60mins of liss a week at peak volume. as volume comes down, cardio goes up and vice versa. incline treadmill for them calf gains. I averaged 7 hours of sleep over the past 3 months, but M-F i generally got about 6.5 hours a night and ""caught up"" on the weekends. my heart rate before blast and when i was getting more sleep daily was averaging 71, and now on blast with less sleep i average 80. 

**What Went Wrong:** I hurt my left elbow early on. i was already starting to feel it and decided to push it more, and an incline machine press decided to fuck it up. this is where in the spreadsheet youll see my workouts make a really weird turn on push days. tricep work mostly disappeared, chest work turned 100% flies. as i rehabed it while still lifting, i made sure to stay on top of triceps with BFR training. the light weight didnt seem to bother it. Indoor Gyms closed back down right at the beginning, so i changed to a gym with an outdoor setting. turns out they were still open indoors, but that also changed after my 1st week there. so more adjustments made, i was training outdoors. then after a long shopping trip, i ended up with tennis elbow on my right elbow. had to make more adjustments to exercises. The lower back pumps on leg day would be pretty killer at points. adrol gave me gyno. training outdoors at 4am got kinda chilly at times, but i was happy just to be able to train with all this good equipment. CGBP fucking sucks. Rack pulls/BB rows werent for me. 

**What Went Right:** I discovered that moving more of my volume to flyes made my chest grow significantly more than pressing. and the arsenal fly is the greatest chest equipment in the world. i think ive fully nailed how to best program my back and chest for growth with the right equipment. this whole program was full of learning opportunities and now i think ive got everything set for exactly how i want to train and set everything up. The original gym closure gave me the opportunity/excuse to train at one of the best gyms in the country. People there are also extremely nice, and the training environment is exactly what ive always wanted. my diet went really well, and the cycle mostly went great. 

**Going Forward:** bridge while cutting, probably something like 250mg of test, stay at 80 sets and do my best to keep the load the same on my exercises. if reps drop below 50% of what i was doing on blast, ill lighten the load, but doing 5-6 reps with the same weight as i was doing for 8-10 is perfectly fine for me. after that, next blast is planned for test/primo/mast and thinking GH too. goal is to hit 1.5g of total gear for the next blast. Work back up to 120 sets, hitting back 3x a week, build as much tissue as i can, and then start planning a prep for my first competition in classic physique. 

**FAQs that havent been asked yet:**

**Can i do this as a natty?** yea sure why not. the progression might be different, but theres nothing stopping you. you might want to adjust the sets, maybe go from 60-100, or 80-100 or whatever, idk i never planned this for natties nor did the authors. but find out for yourself, experiment, learn, grow.

**Why are you so weak?** beats me, i dont actively try to be weak though. i try to use the most amount of weight i can within the parameters ive set for lifting (great form, tempoed correctly, within desired rep ranges). and fuck you

**Why the varied rep ranges?** i think some exercises/muscles work better in different rep ranges, i think its good to have variance for different kinds of stressors, its less boring, idk i dont think its ultimately that important tho. 

**What were your rest times?** as long as i wanted/needed to progress my next set. if i only took 30-60 seconds, i doubt id be able to increase my reps each set. if you want to be ultra strict on that go for it tho

**How long were your workouts?** at peak volume, lifting took 75-90 minutes. then monday id pose and maybe do cardio, and other days id do cardio when i could. 

**Can i do X amount of sets instead?** you wont get arrested or die, ive only written out the guidelines based off the info i have learned. if you think you know more than them, by all means.

**Why X amount of exercises?** I dont think you need a billion different exercises for 1 muscle group, 2-3 is generally good enough. just do more sets of the exercises that work the best for you, instead of adding an exercise thats mediocre for you.

**Why didnt you eat more vegetables?** cuz i was lazy, but honestly i got most of my micronutrients in daily anyways

**What supplements did you take?** Coq10, Vit D, Cranberry Extract, P5P, NAC, Turmeric, ZMA. no fish oil cuz i ate salmon

**Why are you so small for so much drugs?** Im just trying to get toned man

**Would you recommend this for a strength athlete in a hypertrophy block?** uh, idk. sure? im sure theres a million ways to tweak this to suite your goals. 

**Why did you waste so much time typing this out?** cuz i like the sound of my voice in my head while writing this all out. i had some free time today anyways. 

**Honorable Mentions:**

shoutout to the lovely people who i constantly communicate with. you guys keep me driven and focused, and im happy to be someone you guys share time with. 

to the bros who message me on reddit, you guys make sure i have to stay on top of things or i know youll pass me up. 

to the fucking jacked mfers im constantly chasing after who are in prep right now, hope to see you on stage at nationals one day! 


Any other questions or comments feel free to drop in and ill answer. Im not some huge mecca of knowledge, just another gym bro trying to be big and likes to write entirely too much.

thank you guys for reading and if you made it all the way through, know that i would have happily been your valentine yesterday.",2021-02-15 20:44:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/lkmoy3/program_review_myocyte_maturation_or_how_to/
laowrm,weightroom,"[Program (Challenge) Review] Dan John’s 10,000 Kettlebell Swing Challenge","So I just finished [Dan John’s 10,000 swing kettlebell challenge](https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/10000-swing-kettlebell-workout) and thought I’d write about my experience and results.

**KB weight:**

Being that I don’t have a 24 KG bell (the weight recommended for men), I used my 50 lb bell for almost everything.  Eventually, I started incorporating my 32 KG bell into some of the sets of 10 to make them more difficult.

**Breaking up the sets and grip issues:**

Firstly, I chose the 5 sessions a week for 4 weeks option.  It’s 500 swings for 20 sessions regardless of whether you do it in 4 weeks or 5, though.

I tried a variety of different ways to break up the sets.  First I tried the sets of 10, 15, 25, and 50...but the sets of 50 absolutely murdered my hands.  The next day I had horrible blisters on my pinkies and ring fingers because my hands are too big for all 10 fingers to fit inside the bell and whichever ones I put outside got rubbed raw.  This has never been a problem doing lots of swings before but doing several sets of 50 just seemed to push my skin over the edge.

So I experimented with the 15 and 35 swings for 10 sets and the 10, 15, and 25 swings for 10 sets but ended up using the second option most often.  I also started working in 1-arm swings during the sets of 25 because they really saved my grip (more grip work but easier on the hands as no fingers are outside the bell and getting pinched/rubbed).  I obviously found the 1-arm swings more challenging for the core, forearm, lats, etc.  It was nice to mix both 1 and 2-arm swings in together for the additional challenge and slight variety as this program gets pretty monotonous really quickly!

**Strength movements in between:**

I kept it simple and either did goblet squats or 1-arm KB presses.  Reps were 1, 2, 3 between every set of swings.

**Time:**

I treated the whole thing like a time challenge.  My goal was to rest as little as possible and constantly push the pace and improve my time.  The average session took around 30-35 minutes.  My fastest time was 22 minutes and my slowest, when I had a terrible sleep the night before and felt like crap, was 38 minutes.  I definitely felt myself getting faster and faster throughout the month.  To keep things challenging I started incorporating the 32KG bell for some of the lower rep sets of 10.

**Form:**

This challenge really helped me dial in my kettlebell swing form.  Obviously, doing 10,000 reps of something is going to grease the groove and dial in your form... provided you’re doing them right.  That’s the thing with 10,000 swings, though.  If you aren’t doing them right your body will let you know right away.  So doing that many reps reinforced a really nice hinge and plank pattern, over and over.  I also found really emphasizing squeezing the glutes and abs at the top in the plank kept my lower back fresh and able to keep coming back for more swings.

**Results:**

After about the first week and a half I started getting amazing endorphin rushes at the end. It was the high I’ve gotten from running a long distance without the joint stress and usually in 30 mins or less.  Starting each session was hard as they were boring but I always felt incredible afterwards.

I saw some good physical results from this challenge.  I was going for better cardio and fat loss and that’s what I got.  My resting heart rate went from mid 60’s down to 52-54.  I was clocking my heart rate at at least 170 at the end of each session and one time at 190.  I’m pretty sure this is the hardest I’ve worked cardiovascularly in a while.

I’m 100% convinced my grip, lats, traps, forearms, glutes, and lower back are stronger.  Obviously that’s pretty par for the course for doing 10,000 weighted hip hinges while holding a weight over a month...

The challenge helped me lose about 2” off my waistline and around 8 pounds over the course of the month (from 209 down to 201).  It helped me get my waistline measurement below half of my height (which is pretty welcome for me because I’ve had an annoying flabby little pooch despite not being too big everywhere else for a while now).

Obviously, anytime weight is lost calories are ultimately responsible.  I did clean up my diet a bit during this challenge but nothing drastic; I didn’t count calories, didn’t start weighing out foods, and still had cream and sugar in my coffees.  Basically I just cut out crap like junk food that I know I’m not supposed to be eating, focused on getting in more quality protein, and drank more water.  However, I strongly believe the 10,000 swings aided the overall fat loss as the dietary changes alone were pretty basic.

Overall, I feel amazing after this challenge.  I think this is the best my cardio has been in years.  After my fingers got used to the grip volume and built callouses where they didn’t have them before (despite swinging KBs for a long time prior to this), the grip issue pretty much went away.  Other than that, I feel noticeably stronger in my glutes, grip, lats, etc. as mentioned before.

**Difficulty of finishing:**

This is the hardest “program” (I know, its a challenge not a program) to finish that I’ve ever done.  It’s not the physical difficulty of it...it’s the sheer monotony of swinging a kettlebell over and over and over again for 20 sessions. It really became an exercise in mental discipline more than anything else.  When I got halfway through I wanted to quit.  I was asking myself what the point of this is...  I’m pretty ADHD and always want to try new programs and ideas and had a million things I wanted to try when this one got boring.  Then I decided it’s a CHALLENGE and I need to just finish it.  I banned myself from reading about any other programs or challenges after that and decided to finish.  If nothing else, I decided I was going to complete it for the practice of mental discipline.  So I wrote out every remaining session in my journal and the reps I would do.  Then I had some accountability and realized I had to finish it.

**Would I recommend it?**

After all that...I honestly don’t know if I would recommend this challenge.  It’s pretty freaking boring and monotonous.  I mean, it had its moments when I would get into a real groove and a sort of zen-state but mostly it just felt really repetitive.  Eventually I started listening to cheesy pump up EDM mixes (which I never do usually) to push through it.

I wouldn’t even think about recommending this to someone who hasn’t been comfortably swinging kettlebells for enough time to build up a good hinge pattern and who isn’t VERY comfortable with the size of bell they’re going to use.

If you’re experienced enough, want a challenge that will absolutely tax your lungs and grip, and don’t want to have to think about how to structure your program AT ALL for a month, then perhaps it’s worth a shot.  Honestly though, you’d have to be pretty strange to actually enjoy this program.  I remember reading someone post that they wanted this to be their regular program every month.  I definitely cannot relate to that...  I got through it and liked how it made me feel afterwards but can’t really say I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the results and the endorphins afterwards but hardly ever enjoyed the workouts themselves.

The reason I tried it is because I haven’t been too consistent with my lifting in the last few months and wanted something 100% structured that I absolutely did not need to think about and that would kickstart me back into things.  For that, it worked well.

Anyways, hope someone got something out of the write up.  Now onto something with a little more variety!  I just need to get back into being consistent.  I’m thinking of a basic 5/3/1 setup with some kettlebells as assistance work as well.  I don’t think I’ll be tempted to do high rep sets of swings for a little while, though. 😂

kn7siu,weightroom,"BBB. Not boring, but not exactly big, but a lot stronger. (Program Review)","Ah yes, another Boring But Big review. Like you guys haven’t read one of these before. I encourage you to keep reading. The program worked great for me.

I’ve completed 4 complete cycles and am on cycle 5 right now. I’ve recently maxed (or close to it) on most of my lifts and thought it was a good time to post this. (So approximately 5 months on the program)

\*[Video of Squat](https://twitter.com/TheCoachFro/status/1340091314273054720?s=20) I had a lot of hip pain when I started squatting. I worked that out with a sports doctor and it hasn't returned since. I'm unsure of what my actual squat is. 385 moved smoothly. I think I maybe had 405 in the tank. We'll just use 385 since it's technically my max lifted.

\*\*[Video of 225 OHP](https://twitter.com/TheCoachFro/status/1329557061156311041?s=20) because 2 plates was a cool milestone. 230 was much smoother and had much better form from what I could see in the mirror. Wish I would have recorded that, but I'll record the next milestone.

\*\*\* [Video of Deadlift](https://twitter.com/TheCoachFro/status/1344074917361250304?s=20) bad form, need to work on getting hips closer. I’m pulling conventional with a sumo stance, but heavy sumo is new to me as of like 2 weeks ago so I’m working through the kinks.

&#x200B;

**That brings my old totals to:**

* 1080 or 905 with the big three (minus OHP)

&#x200B;

**I added:**

* BW: 12 pounds
* OHP: 55 pounds
* Bench: 35 (Don’t know my true max, just using the 315 total)
* Squat: 105 pounds
* Deadlift: 130 pounds
* Total added: 325 pounds or 270 for the big 3
* New total: 1405 or 1175 for the big 3 (95 pounds more than my starting total that included OHP!)

&#x200B;

**Other:**

Started running, mention below a little bit. Some running milestones:

* 11k in 50 minutes. (Was shooting for a 50 minute 10k and miscalculated the laps. When I finished found out I ran an 11k)
* 125k in 15.5 hours. GPS verified race. I never want to do it again. Placed in the top 60 out of 19,000+ runners. Died 7 times.

&#x200B;

So yeah, love the results. As we all know there’s more too it so here’s a summary of what I did and what I was doing before:

&#x200B;

**Before quarantine: (Skip this if you just want the review of BBB)**

I mostly was messing around. Trying to come up with my own programs. I was trying to remember what we use to do in high school when I played football. I was strong back when I was a kid so it should work now right? Well, I soon found out that my high school coaches didn’t actually know what they were talking about when it came to lifting.

&#x200B;

They worked to a point, but soon stopped working and I was spinning my wheels. I was also a chubby 210 pounds. I had some muscle showing, but wasn’t happy with how I looked, felt, or performed in the gym. I went online and started figuring out programs and jumped on Nsuns. I started seeing real progress. I started counting calories and maintained by body weight with the 3,000 calories and running Nsuns.

&#x200B;

I didn’t do a good job of recording data from this time period, but my approximate lifts when starting nsuns were:

&#x200B;

* Bench: 185ish
* Deadlift: 225ish
* Squat: 185ish
* OHP: 135ish (by far my best lift if you can’t tell, I even started good with it)

&#x200B;

I ended up getting a coaching job for track and field and started running as well. Got some great times in, but found out that I didn’t have the time with 3 jobs, running, and lifting. Cut the running down to simple conditioning, but might very well get into it someday if I have the time to do so.

Then corona virus happened…

I’m probably not retelling this in the exact order of what happened. I became depressed. No coaching job for the season, no gym, so I kept running. I also decided to grab some odd parts from around the apartment. I had some cinder blocks and an iron pipe. It all weighed approximately 135 pounds. I could squat it, floor press it, deadlift it, and OHP it. So I did. Until I didn’t feel like it anymore because of the depression.

I did pull ups, chins ups, abs, and ran. I eventually added push ups and body weight squats. Sometime during this period I decided that if I couldn’t lift I should lose this fat. So I did. I went from 210 to 168 pounds in about 3 months. I looked great, but could tell I lost a lot of muscle as well.

Sometime during all of this we had massive fires where I live and I was evacuated from my home for multiple weeks. The fire burnt to our yard and was stopped a few hours before taking our house with it. It was the largest fire in state history, but it couldn’t manage to take my house.

Fast forward, I found a gym that opened up outside. I started lifting on some made up stuff just to get back into it. Basically a 3x5 program so I could get back into things. Once I reached the starting maxes you read above I decided I wanted to gain weight again. Of course Boring but Big had to be the thing to do.

I upped my calories slowly, 100 calories a week, until I was back to 3,000. I’ve been gaining about 2 pounds a month on that. I assume it’ll slow down a bit. When weight gain stops, I’ll up my calories again.

All in all I didn’t lift for approximately 3 months out of the year in between Nsuns and BBB.

&#x200B;

**Boring but big set up with accessories:**

* (All accessories done in a similar manner to BBB. 3x5, with the last set being a + set. Followed by 2x10 at about 50% for volume. I stick at the same exact weight for an entire cycle and try to beat my + set before increasing by 5 pounds. This works really great for me.)
* All BBB sets done with 5x10 at 50% sometimes heavier, mostly not.
* Every day finished up with core workout and cardio. Go to core workouts decline situps, hanging leg raises, Russian twists. Usually do all 3.
* Go to cardio: Air bike, flip tractor tire, push/pull a sled, Farmer or suitcase carry.
* Added 10 pounds per cycle for upper body lifts and 15 pounds per cycle on lower body lifts. (Against recommendation of 5/10)

&#x200B;

**Day 1:**

* OHP
* OHP BBB
* Weighted dips
* T-Rows
* Facepulls (Superset with tricep pushdowns)
* Chest-Flys (Superset with reverse flys)

&#x200B;

**Day 2:**

* Squat
* Squat BBB
* Front Squat
* Lat Pulldowns
* Weighted back extensions
* Lateral raises (superset with front raises, rear delt raises)

&#x200B;

**Day 3:**

* Rest

&#x200B;

**Day 4:**

* Bench Press
* BBB Bench Press
* Close Grip Bench Press
* Chest supported Machine Rows
* Facepulls (Superset with tricep pushodwns)
* Incline curls

&#x200B;

**Day 5:**

* Deadlift
* BBB Stiff Legged Deadlifts
* Shrugs
* Weighted Chin Ups
* Machine Hack Squats
* Leg Curls

&#x200B;

Sometimes I would substitute lifts depending if someone was using equipment or I felt like changing it up. For example, chest supported rows might be bent over rows or cable machine rows. Hack squats might be hip thrusts. I probably changed up a different accessory once a week for a bit of variety.

&#x200B;

**Diet on program:**

I was blessed. The 3rd job that we took on for a local University had the perk of having access to 3 prepared meals a day for free. I used all of them!

I ate about every 3 hours and about 30-40 grams of protein a meal every day. That matched with eating approximately 3,000 calories a day was the only thing I did.

I also stopped drinking all alcohol this year. I just grew out of it for some reason? Maybe it was originally hard to drink when I was counting calories to lose weight and then I just never added back in. I don’t really miss it though.

Drank a gallon of water every day. Sometimes a little more on training days. Sometimes a little less on days that I didn't train. Took a scoop of creatine every day and if I was tired a black coffee or caffeine pill equivalent of a black coffee before working out.

I ate basically the same thing every day. Here’s a solid example:

&#x200B;

**Meal 1:**

* 2 slices of French toast
* 3 eggs (scrambled)
* A cup of fresh mixed fruit
* Cup of fat free milk

&#x200B;

**Meal 2:**

* Protein shake

Or

* Fat free plain greek yogurt, mixed with a scoop of protein, mixed with protein enriched special k

&#x200B;

**Meal 3:**

* Garden salad, no dressing. Topped with grilled chicken.
* Cup of roasted vegetables.
* Cup of mixed Fruit.
* Cup of fat free milk

&#x200B;

**Meal 4:**

* Garden salad, no dressing. Topped with grilled chicken.
* Cup of roasted vegetables.
* Cup of mixed Fruit.
* Cup of fat free milk

&#x200B;

**Meal 5:**

We eat plant based dinners or occasionally fish meals. An example:

* Hi protein chickpea pasta with broccoli

Or

* Veggie rice (10 grams of protein per serving), Smoked Salmon, Brussel Sprouts

&#x200B;

**Snack:**

Most days I would have enough calories left over for a cookie or 2 before bed. Sometimes I didn’t and I would eat a cookie or two and not worry about it. An extra 100-200 calories wouldn’t be a bad thing when trying to gain weight.

&#x200B;

**What’s next:**

It isn’t broken don’t fix it right? More BBB until it no longer works.

&#x200B;

**New goals for this year:**

* Gain 20 pounds, slowly. The right way.
* OHP 250 pounds (20 pounds away)
* Squat 450 pounds (Most likely about 50 pounds away, but officially 75 pounds away)
* Deadlift ??? I think I would have been happy with 500, but I’m still perfecting form and that’s only 25 pounds away. Who knows, maybe 550?
* Bench: 405 Maybe a bit of a stretch, but I did do 315 x 3 recently with 1-2 left in the tank. Maybe not as far off as I think.

&#x200B;

**Advice:**

* There’s a ton of strength to be gained in volume and AMRAP sets. A lot. I don’t think some people realize this. It doesn’t have to be the heaviest weight in the world, but it doesn’t mean you can't work hard with lighter weights!
* The stronger your back is the stronger you are. Make your back stronger.
* Eat to get stronger. Think about the things you put into your body. Try to make decisions that align with your goal, but if you don’t make the best choice every now and then so be it.
* There’s not too many valid excuses. I work 3 jobs one of them full time, have a child, and take foster children in from time to time. My spouse is twice as busy as me. There’s time if you just make it instead of excuses. Motivation not required to put the work in.
* I know I’m not the strongest guy out there, but I think I’m on track to being the strongest me possible in the next few years. That’s all we can ask of ourselves. Don’t compare yourself to others. Celebrate everyone’s victories, as small or as big as they may be. Seeing people get excited about deadlifting 600 pounds is just as exciting to me as someone getting pumped deadlifting 225 pounds for the first time.",2020-12-30 18:32:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/kn7siu/bbb_not_boring_but_not_exactly_big_but_a_lot/
kdsr2x,weightroom,How to gracefully retire from training: An interview with former bodybuilder Jimmy Her,"I would like to post one more interview from [Strength Speaks.](https://leanpub.com/strength-speaks) Unlike all the others athletes I had the pleasure of interviewing, Jimmy Her had retired from serious training. He spoke at length of how he was able to find that sense of completion, and his mindset regarding training and using the lessons learned through lifting in life were very insightful. Even those of us who never see ourselves ending this journey stand to gain from the perspective of someone who was able to do so gracefully. Without further ado:  
  
## Jimmy Her  
  
**Michael Chernin:** How old are you and how long have you been training?  
  
**Jimmy Her:** I'm twenty-eight years old. Training for fourteen years now, so half my life, I guess.  
  
**MC:** What's been your primary strength sport interest?  
  
**JH:** I spent the most time bodybuilding, doing hypertrophy workouts, watching Ronnie Coleman on the toilet, muscular development, the whole thing, you know? But the last three years I took a total 180, just reversed out of that. Right now I'm more focused on health-related goals, trying to get a couple years back, trying to add a couple years, whatever health might mean. I've been dedicating the last three years to that and that's changed my entire perspective. From going all the way into bodybuilding to a complete 180 when I was supposed to be good, you know what I mean?  
  
**MC:** That's not a typical response that I've gotten. What caused you to do that 180?  
  
**JH:** To me, it was not a 180, just with the way I think. The goal was always the same. What got me into bodybuilding in the first place was that I see it as a form of finding meaning and fighting for that meaning. It's one thing to find the meaning of life, of lifting weights, of bodybuilding, how it translates. It's another thing to fight for that meaning to stay in existence.  
  
**MC:** Tell me more.  
  
**JH:** I can say, ""I'm Jimmy Quads, I squat 405 5x5 every day five times a week."" How long can you do that? That's cool or whatever, but eventually it's a question of how long that can be done and how long you can feasibly put that on your back, over and over and over again, redundantly. My point is that I don't feel like I changed anything. The goal was always the same. What motivated me to put that 405 on my back and do it endlessly, and bodybuilding, etcetera, was just to fight for that meaning. Because eventually, bodybuilding becomes your identity. It could be powerlifting, it could be Olympic weightlifting, it could be Crossfit, it doesn't really matter. Eventually, the things you do in the gym end up encompassing who you are as a person. And that doesn't really make sense when you listen to it on a podcast or whatever, but it makes more sense when you're in the middle of the set. You know what I mean? When you're in the middle of a set of fifty, or ten, or even one...there's so many sides to it, because you know that whether you make the rep or not, whether you win the show or not, that nothing's really promised. There's no glory that comes with it, and that's the beauty of it, because that's where the fight for that meaning begins. Right in the middle of that rep, in the middle of that set, that's where the fight for that meaning begins. But inevitably, you kind of just lose. *[Laughs]*  
  
**MC:** What was the meaning that you found, or did it change over time?  
  
**JH:** It always will change, I guess, but right now, if I had to say, it's that life is just suffering. But if one wants to say ""you should feel bad because people suffer,"" no, suffering is a beautiful thing. Have you ever done a set of fifty squats or seventy or whatever until you puke? That's just beautiful, man! But to say that, especially to someone who doesn't understand it, that's just bizarre. It's as bizarre as someone making millions of dollars playing golf. But we find our own meaning in that and we defend it with every rep. That meaning, whatever lifting means to you, ends up eventually taking its own form of life, and eventually, you have to grow from that. I'm still getting my reps in, they're just not in the form of reps in the gym. You know what I mean? I just wanted to be elsewhere. By that, I mean I'm still fighting for that meaning. I'm still fighting for those reps. I'm still getting those reps. So when I say that I feel like I haven't made any change, even though on paper, physically, I've done a total 180, in my mind, I feel like I haven't at all, because the goal is still the same: fighting for that meaning. Fighting for that thing that makes you an individual. For me, now, that would be health, taking care of my family, my mom, my siblings, my nieces and nephews. And that's more important to me right now. I've taken all that energy from bodybuilding, from powerlifting, even Olympic weightlifting. I'm definitely not putting in as much time as I should or even like to in Olympic weightlifting, for example. But if I learned anything in bodybuilding, it's to never go full retard. *[Laughs]* It's to never go full retard. And I spent a couple years pretty retarded. I don't mean to be mean, I'm just keeping it real. I don't want to do that with Oly, I guess.  
  
**MC:** Couple questions based on what you said. You mentioned suffering. Obviously we suffer in the gym quite a bit intentionally. But that suffering is purposeful. I'm all for purposeful suffering. But I'm not for suffering without a purpose. You think the gym is a good manifestation of that?  
  
**JH:** Yes. Yes, ultimately. At the end of the day, with something like COVID, for example. I don't know his name, but he works at a teen center. And he was saying that when the gym was closed down, they were getting twice as many people right away. He works at a center for at-risk youth. And Los, gyms, even Lifetime, whatever bougie gyms, it's a temple for people like us. And not just people like us, people who want to strive for that meaning and want to fight for it. Ninety-nine percent of the things we do in here are metaphorical. When it comes down to the thinking pattern, what made you walk into the gym in the first place, it's all a mental game to begin with. Specifically, that mental game relates right back to suffering. Like you said, nobody wants to suffer for no reason. But it's the belief that you are suffering for a reason, it's the belief that if I do this 405 5x5 ten times in this lifting cycle, I might be Mr. Olympia one day. Maybe I might be the next Jay Cutler. Everyone has those delusional thoughts, but those delusional thoughts are what create champions in the first place. They interviewed Sugar Ray Leonard and they asked him, ""can you beat Mayweather right now?"" He's like fifty-five, sixty years old, and he said yes. And the reporter said, ""you're out of your mind, he's the greatest in the world!"" But he said, ""that's what it takes, I was a champion in the eighties, in the nineties."" That confidence is what it takes for you to be a champion in the first place, otherwise he never would have won his first fight. And that's the mentality. On one side it might be delusional, but on the other side, everyone kind of thinks like that. Bodybuilding, powerlifting, strongman, Olympic weightlifting, you need that delusion. Not only that, but you need to ingrain that delusion in the form of sets, reps, puking, and fucking bleeding. And you need to fight for its existence. Otherwise, you're gonna believe yourself when you say, ""Jimmy Her, Mr. Olympia? Pshh!"" You know what I mean? And then you start fighting yourself and you wonder why you failed. You wonder why you missed that rep.  
  
**MC:** Mmhmm.  
  
**JH:** To bring that back to me, I just lost that fight, I guess. Happily. Eventually, I was like, ""why am I choosing to find myself this way?"" Eventually, it wasn't necessarily serving me. I look back to my real reality, beyond the thoughts in my head, look at my family, look at my mom, my nieces and nephews, there's one new niece and nephew every year. I got six siblings. I just needed to fight for my own meaning of existence beyond the reps. Beyond the reps in the form of reps. I still have that mentality, that bodybuilding mentality. I don't think that'll go away. Arnold still has that mentality. Look at Ronnie Coleman. He's got twelve fucking back surgeries, he's got the mentality still. If Ronnie Coleman played golf, he'd have that mentality. He might not be the world champion, he might not move very far, he might not do well in golf, but it's more of a mentality. That's why we all get along here. We might poke fun at each other, but at the end of the day, we'll show up to each other's funerals. We'll show up to a situation if it actually mattered. And that's what I'm on. I'm not trying to find things anymore. I'm trying to just...cave in to who I was before. And putting that energy from myself in the form of bodybuilding. Bodybuilding's a very selfish sport. I was very one-track minded. All the time, I was taking energy away from my family, loved ones. It does wear on you, and I didn't see it at the time, but now I see it. It wears on them, too.  
  
**MC:** What initially got you into the gym?  
  
**JH:** I bring up family a lot because family is one of the main reasons that got me into the gym in the first place. I was fourteen, overweight, chubby, picked on. Started wrestling, my brother got me into that, he was a wrestling captain. I didn't like wrestling as much as lifting weights, and eventually that inevitably took over. By my senior year, I'd quit wrestling. I had a couple injuries. Broke my leg twice. As a wrestler, I wasn't competitive. I don't have a competitive nature. I was that guy that would do well in practice but horrible on the mat. Just have a fucking nervous breakdown. But that translated really well to lifting weights. If you're almost a recluse, you're able to dig deeper. You squat a little lower, you're a little bit crazier. I don't really know why that is. It just seems that people who have suffered more or are willing to suffer more end up doing better at these kinds of sports. That's something I definitely took pride in.  
  
**MC:** How much suffering you could take?  
  
**JH:** Oh yeah. If bodybuilding was a ""how many times can you get hit in the head with a fucking baseball bat"" sport, I would have won. I'd be Mr. Olympia. There's that confidence thing again. That's how it is. There's beauty in that. There's millions of people in the world that find beauty in that, too. By beauty, I mean the complete opposite of suffering...in suffering. Almost its complete counterpart. It might be different from person to person, from sport to sport. But if one doesn't find it, it's their fault. If one doesn't find that meaning, it won't do anything for you anyway. If you can't find the meaning, why bother?  
  
**MC:** You mentioned that for a couple years in your bodybuilding career, you went full retard. How did that manifest and what was the thing that caused you to step away from that?  
  
**JH:** I say that now. I say I went full retard now, but at the time, it was a badge of honor, an imaginary Purple Heart. And it's not that I regret those things, I'm proud of doing those things, and by things I mean like squatting until you literally puke, squatting until the bar falls on you, until people have to catch the bar off of you. It's kind of dramatic, but when you're in the middle of the set, it makes perfect sense. Nothing more makes sense, rather. Literally nothing more makes sense than dying and having someone pull the bar off of your back. It's orgasmic, almost. And I guess, in that way, it can be retarded. *[Laughs]* It's like I said earlier. The exact opposite of suffering can be found in suffering. If I'm here now, saying I went full retard, it means that it was the complete opposite when I was in the moment of going full retard.  
  
**MC:** It sounds like a hindsight thing. You can't always realize you're being a retard in the moment. You need to get that experience and get that hindsight.  
  
**JH:** I guess there's a third side to that too, because all of that is necessary. Going through that and calling myself that and reversing out of that. Those are all necessary steps to be where I'm at and for me to be anywhere in the future. That's one of the biggest takeaways from bodybuilding, that suffering is sacred. You're gonna do it. It's gonna happen. We all dread going to work, we get that fucking coffee in, we go to work, we jump in a car on the dot same time every day. We dread it, we suffer from it. Bodybuilding forces you to be comfortable with that idea, with the concept of suffering. That word has a really negative connotation, but if you took suffering out of anyone's life, you'd completely destroy them. I think Nietzsche said that he lets his peers suffer. What did he say? ""Don't flatter your benefactors."" Something to that end. That's one thing I learned from bodybuilding. You're fine even if you're going through hell. One day, I did eleven days of zero carbs right before my show, and I ended up winning. I remember literally going nuts, and at the end of it, being fine. Looking back on that now, I'm so glad I did that. There's no way I could ever regret something like that, or any of the sets of twenty, sets of fifty. There isn't a person in here that has failed a squat, dropped a squat more than I have on the fucking floor and felt like an idiot from doing that. But still, even with that ugliness, I'm still proud of that. You can't really regret those kinds of things. Suffering, even sorrow, is the foundation of strength to begin with. Happiness doesn't produce happiness and strength doesn't produce strength. Sorrow does. Suffering does. There aren't happy lifters.  
  
**MC:** You don't think so?  
  
**JH:** There are lifters that are happy, but there aren't happy lifters.  
  
**MC:** What's the difference?  
  
**JH:** I should define happy here. Let me take a step back. There aren't people who had an easy life that are gonna be doing well in bodybuilding. There aren't people that had a good childhood that's gonna be Mr. Olympia one day. I don't think there ever will be, and I don't think there are. And that's any champion. Youtube up some gold medalist winner right now, and in their biography, all suffering, all difficult, all challenges. And that's what I took from bodybuilding is that even if you had a hard life, even if your childhood sucked, even if your life now sucks, you can go to the gym, you can find meaning, and you can defend it within the same rep. Nowhere in life can you do that. You can't do that in your job, you can't do that at home, you can't do that when you're getting your dick sucked. You gotta go to the gym, you gotta find meaning, and you gotta fight for it. Otherwise, why the fuck are you here? And that's all beautiful. That's why I can't regret nothing. At the end of the day, that is my foundation of strength. I did those reps. I did those really difficult sets where I didn't think I could do it, but I did it, and it's 100 percent symbolic of that time where I got my ass kicked in school, or that time where I got overdisciplined, or that time where I didn't speak up for myself, or that time I felt weak and taken advantage of. I can go to the gym and put seven hundred pounds on my back and fight and have meaning and be perfectly fine. And that's something you can find as a strongman, a bodybuilder, or a powerlifter. That's something you can find brushing your teeth, I think. 'Cause brushing your teeth is really hard. That sounds goofy, but I don't think there are many people that brush twice a day. Even brushing your teeth, you can get this lesson too, brushing your teeth and flossing twice a day, that's really difficult, and that can be correlated to suffering. Maybe you got shit going on, maybe you don't got time for that. Just like bodybuilding, just like powerlifting, you can get those same lessons if you so choose to, if your mind is open enough to be able to accept the idea that something even as simple as brushing your teeth might be suffering, and that suffering might correlate to being a better you. But if you laugh at that idea, well, that's not gonna happen to you!  
  
**MC:** Because you're not open to it.  
  
**JH:** That's ultimately what it is.  
  
**MC:** What are your biggest accomplishments in bodybuilding?  
  
**JH:** In a way, I feel that I listed them. I guess what they are specifically...is nothing in the form of anything physical. It's all mental, states of mind, and how that translates to my physical body. So long story short, I got myself, who I am today, from it. That's one side of I want to say. The other side I want to say is ""nothing."" Because you don't really win anything. Like I was saying, 99 percent of the things we do in here are metaphorical. We're fine with that. We're not in here to win shit anyway. I was never happy when I won anything. When I won my overall, I slept like two hours, and I drove home at 5 a.m. I just wasn't happy. At the time, I didn't know what to think. I was on so many drugs, I didn't know what the fuck to think anyway. Looking back, I can pretty much clearly say that I was literally trying to find happiness in the sport, and I think that's one big mistake I made. I was already happy in the gym lifting weights. I was already happy to have the opportunity to even drive to a show and compete. I told myself, I sold myself on the idea that THIS would bring me happiness. No, you're already happy in the gym, man, what is the problem? You don't need to compete for a plastic trophy! At the end of the day, there's always another milestone, there's always another thing you have to do. Even Phil Heath, when he lost, it was probably the best thing that could happen to him, in a way. There's always something next that you have to do. And eventually, that something next, because it's always going to be greater and greater, is going to knock you on your ass, and if you don't know how to prepare for that...nothing's going to prepare you for that except for the prior times you've lost. And if in those prior times you've lost, you didn't have an open mind, you didn't have an open heart, you were just lying to yourself, ""oh, I should have won!"" then that's going to speak its own reality. Eventually you're not going to know how to lose, and that's definitely one thing I got from bodybuilding. I learned how to lose. Losing is inevitable in this sport.  
  
**MC:** Can you think of an unforgettable experience you've had in the gym, on stage, something you haven't mentioned yet, one that's going to stay with you?  
  
**JH:** One that's going to stay with me...maybe a couple. A couple that I kind of laugh at. I guess it's memorable to me. I don't know why, but it just keeps popping up in my head. One time I was training with Phong (Nguyen) and (name redacted) was spotting us. He was training us, rather, and we were on the vertical leg press, and I kept grunting. *[Laughs]* he was four weeks out from his show, probably didn't want to be there, but yet he was there training us, and here I am grunting with this baby-ass fucking weight. So what he does, he says ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" and I didn't grunt for an entire year! *[Laughs]* I swear to God, I didn't grunt for an entire year! I definitely didn't grunt for the rest of that workout. We talk about that now, we just laugh at it. It's hilarious. At the time, I was like, ""oh shit, he's gonna kick my ass!"" You know, four weeks out. But I'm glad we can all laugh about it now. Another one...it was probably when Ben (Loehrer) and Charles (Griffen) were sumo wrestling. *[Laughs]* I don't know if you were there that day.  
  
**MC:** I think I've seen it!  
  
**JH:** I think it's still on social media. It was 2017 or 2018. I think everybody let out a lot of stress. It was cool to do that outside in the turf room. For a gym like Los, especially these days, we need more moments like that. I think we're all kind of losing touch. Not with reality, not with ourselves, but with Los. Los is a very symbolic place for everybody, for everybody's life and how they develop, however you want to shape that sentence. So a lot of random memories of Los Campeones.  
  
**MC:** For a philosophical thought, not that the rest of this hasn't been philosophical, there's this concept I like to call the lifting space, which is the size of the role that training plays in your life. It sounds like yours has grown and changed quite a bit. What's it like now?  
  
**JH:** You know, I don't even like putting headphones in. I don't like needing music. I don't like saying, ""I need this song."" My lifting space has definitely gotten less and less, especially with me now doing Olympic weightlifting, usually you can do most things with just a barbell and a couple plates, and you can get an entire workout for hours and not be able to move for the next couple days. I went running the other day, three miles. And here's what I like to do with running, and maybe this is a good reflection of my lifting space. Sometimes I like to take a break in between running so it's more difficult. It's been about five, six weeks since I ran. Yesterday I ran three miles, and it was really difficult. But kind of like the steps of walking up to a barbell and convincing yourself that you're gonna do fifty reps, it's exactly like that when you run. You don't think you can do it. But you call yourself a bitch a hundred times, and eventually, the three miles are ran, just like the fifty squats. I like doing that every now and then. I guess the contrast is that I don't really need the bar and 405 pounds to do that anymore. I might not look as good, I might not have thirty inch quads no more...but I can run three miles cold. What's worth more? I don't know. I'm not the one that's going to be defining it anyway.  
  
**MC:** Who else is?  
  
**JH:** *[Laughs]* is this where the philosophical conversation's going?  
  
**MC:** Yeah, let's take it there!  
  
**JH:** In the words of Sartre, ""hell is other people."" I think he means the actual, factual, biblical hell is other people. How I interpret that is hell is not this fiery burning place we go to if we do bad things. It's here and right now. I believe Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, ""the gates of hell and heaven are at the hearts of every human individual."" Hell and heaven is here right now. So what I mean, before all that Christian shit, hell is other people. Hell is the influence of other people, influencing you in a way where you end up doing shit you don't even want to do, like bodybuilding, or like that show you shouldn't have done that you end up regretting. That's what it is. Hell is other people in the sense that most of what influences you as a person does not even belong to you. It belongs to the eyes of other people, the ears of other people, the scents of other people. You ever failed a rep because the wrong person walked into the room? That's probably everybody. Hell is the factor that allowed your brain to have that person get in your head in the first place. It is the factor that takes you away from that moment that made you miss that rep. That's what I mean by the biblical hell. That's what I think Sartre was saying when he said, ""hell is other people.""  
  
**MC:** What's your day job?  
  
**JH:** My day job is I'm a professional shit talker in the form of a personal trainer.  
  
**MC:** What are some of your hobbies and interests?  
  
**JH:** Hobbies...I mean, I like playing video games. I know I should probably stop, or at least chill on that a little bit. I like gardening. I want to be a farmer one day. Chess. I like smoking weed. *[Laughs]* I had this joke when I was bodybuilding. People always thought that weed got in the way of my bodybuilding. I thought bodybuilding got in the way of my weed smoking! *[Laughs]* My regrets!  
  
**MC:** Can you imagine being done with training, lifting?  
  
**JH:** In my own mind, I feel like I am done. I mean that in the most beautiful way. I'm happily done, man. I don't know if there's more that can be added to that.  
  
**MC:** You've completed it?  
  
**JH:** The tasks will never end. Finding meaning, fighting for that meaning. Bodybuilding, lifting weights, was a stepping stone in order for me to do that. To find meaning and fight for it. Period. I'm done with the metaphors and I'm trying to do the real thing now.  
  
**MC:** What would you like to tell beginner and intermediate lifters reading this?  
  
**JH:** Don't take yourself seriously, man. We're all gonna die, and we're all gonna live. You gotta live first before you die. I started at a younger age, I did my first show at eighteen, and the whole time I just imagined death and suffering and despair. We all know what goes on in the back of people's minds when they do those fucked-up sets where they're puking and bleeding, that's no secret. That's what creates champions, we've been over it. So my advice to kids is just be careful. Me and you, we know what it takes to do that set of fifty, to max out, to powerlift, to bodybuild, to Olympic weightlift, we all know what it takes, having done it already. My advice to kids is just take it easy on yourself, man. This is what I tell my clients: You want to train for something else. You don't want training to be the thing that defines you as a person. You want your training to propel something else in your life. If you had a shitty training day, that's a good thing. That's the point, isn't it? \[*Laughs*] If you had a bad day in the gym, isn't that a good thing? Isn't that what we're here for? When I have my clients stand on the Bosu ball or test their balance or whatever, what I find is within the art of balance, you have to learn that you can't fuck with it. The less you fuck with your own life, the less you try to manipulate things, the less you try to take control of where you want to be versus where you actually are, the better you're going to be, the more balanced you're going to be, the smoother your position will be on that Bosu ball. In one sentence, my best advice to kids is don't take yourself so seriously. 'Cause there's someone better than you, and you're not that great. *[Laughs]* That's my best advice.  
  
**MC:** Is there anything else you'd like to add, anything I didn't ask about, or anything else on your mind?  
  
**JH:** Not really. Maybe just one thing. Nah, maybe not.  
  
**MC:** What is it?  
  
**JH:** I think...it's kind of a bold statement. It's hard to see when people are in the gym for the wrong reasons. It's hard to say you should be in the gym for THIS reason, but when I see somebody who's giving their all in the gym, they're busting their ass every day, and they just don't get the notoriety. Someone else does with a bigger name. And I'm not personally mad about that. I'm personally upset about that. Because I was that guy. I had to bust my ass for years for people to just ignore me before I got my due diligence. When I see that kid in the gym, and I see the kids every day, mind you, when I see them, I'm like, ""man, I see myself in you."" But more than that, damn, the amount you're gonna have to work to be where you want to be, it's kind of hard to see. That's what I mean. It's hard to see people who deserve a better life, period, outside the gym, but they just don't get it. But it's even harder to rationalize that even they'll be OK. Even they'll be OK. Even they need to suffer and take the necessary steps, because I did. I took those necessary steps to be where I'm at and to be where I'm going to be. So do they. So maybe they need to suffer, to learn the lessons. If I learned those lessons from suffering, then maybe they need to do that. It is hard to see, though. There's two sides to it.

jrdggb,weightroom,[Program Review] SBS Hypertrophy 4x with Running,"**Background: 6'1"" 25M**, been training on and off since I was 18. I bought my own equipment in late summer 2019 and promptly quit running (due to jumping into it too fast and having shin splints) and started a bulk while doing nSuns 6x and then transitioned to two run throughs of GZCLP. I started adding 5km runs in half way through the 2nd GZCLP cycle as I noticed my resting HR was creeping higher and the bulk was probably a little too aggressive.

**Longshot goals:**  Qualify for Boston and hit a 5 plate deadlift at roughly the same time.

**Program goal:** I started SBS in early June with the goal of preserving muscle as I upped running volume/intensity, and give my lower back a reprieve from constantly doing heavy compound movements on GZCLP.

**Performance/Results:**  [2019 pics](https://imgur.com/a/GuAPo9z) \- 180 lbs, [Winter 2020 bulk](https://imgur.com/a/B1MgL2K) \- 192, [End SBS pics](https://imgur.com/a/I6py6fu) \- 184,

^(\* OHP lifetime was standing in a gym, I am only able to do it seated in my basement.)

^(\*\* Even basing my start TMs off of my GZCLP e1RMs, high rep deadlifts and OHP buried me in the first two weeks.)

**Program:** [Here's a sample week from my training log.](https://imgur.com/a/h7p3BsQ) There's a lot of abbreviations in it, but for accessories there was always a back, arm, and ab movement each day, with other body parts dispersed. After each run I did hamstring curls, tricep pushdowns, and face pulls with a band to counter posture while running. A normal week looks like this:

|Sun|Mon|Tues|Weds|Thurs|Fri|Sat|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Long Run|T1: Back squat|T1: OHP|alternating 1km intervals [(example)](https://imgur.com/a/ia9L6En)|T1: Deadlift|Pacing run|T1: Bench|

||T3: Stiff Leg Deadlift|||||T3: Landmine OHP|

**Diet:** I tend to eat similar types of foods/quantities every day (eg. 4 eggs each morning, protein shake post workout/run, meat and veggies at lunch/dinner), so if I felt run down and under-recovered I would start eating more. On average, I've actually eaten more over this SBS/running period than during my GZCLP bulk, adding in a bowl of oatmeal with honey before bed, larger breakfasts, and actually drinking some calories instead of just water/black coffee.

**SBS training thoughts:** 

* Each workout takes approximately 90 minutes.
* I worked up to a comfortable single before the working sets of each T1.
* I really enjoyed doing back work every workout.
* For the deload weeks I dropped the singles and just did the prescribed reps for the T1/T2 exercises, and I dropped a set from my accessory work (kept same weight/reps). I found myself feeling very run down and in need of each deload week, to the point where the week after I would usually only hit the minimum reps on the final set to not lower my TM, and didn't continue progressing until later on.
* The autoregulation aspect of the program is great. I do feel like I fell into the trap of only doing 1 more rep than required on a handful of weeks, but in general even just hitting +1 was hard while I ratcheted up my runs.
* Overall I am extremely pleased with the performance of my lifts, both in terms of the singles and rep PRs, especially as running was the 1A goal.
* If I were to do it again, I would have doubled up the deadlift and OHP days at the end of the week and moved my long run after the squat day; there were multiple times where my legs were very fatigued during squats and could've used an extra day. I would also make an effort to eat even more food.

**Next steps:** I'll hopefully be able to spend time with my family for a couple weeks around Christmas which will be a natural deload, so I plan on restarting another SBS hypertrophy program until then with the following modifications:

* Switching to 5x/week and doing 6 shorter runs to go back to a base building phase through winter with the risk of ice/snow.
* Swapping out a lot of the T2s for pause variations of the main lifts so I can drill in some better technique/form.
* Dropping some of the arm/ab accessories for calves/quads/adductors volume.",2020-11-10 03:37:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/jrdggb/program_review_sbs_hypertrophy_4x_with_running/
iz02il,weightroom,[PROGRAM REVIEW] JnT 2.0 by GZCL,"Thought I might as well documenting how my run with JnT 2.0 went, being the first program I've stuck with to the end.

**Background**

24/M/96kg/183cm. Used to swim competitively during my younger days but stopped around 17/18 to focus on studying. Been gymming since 20 years old but only the typical bro-splits and doing my own thing until around 2-3 years ago when I actually started deadlifting for the first time. Even then, the past 2-3 years have Been a bit wishy-washy with programs since I used to just auto-pilot. The COVID lockdown (gyms closed for 5 months) made me appreciate the gym more so I decided to make actual strength goals and tried sticking to a routine to try get my strength back in general.

For an example of my wishy-washyness, I was pretty much doing a mix of metallicapda's PPL (but 4-5 days instead of the actual 6), PHUL, coolcicada's PPL (again, 4-5 days where I'd just not do the 5th-6th day), with heavy modifications where I'd just drop exercises to make things easier for myself. Definitely was on autopilot pre-lockdown.

During the lockdown I started long distance running, and was planning to do a half marathon though I'm running less now (will elaborate later in the post).

I was gymming for 1.5 months (after coming back from lockdown) before I started this program.

**Routine/Modifications**

So I ran the program as provided [here.](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html) The modification I made is that I added an optional day 5 (which just ended up being another day of training back) because I personally wanted to deadlift more. Also opted to do 2 T2 exercises and 3 T3 exercises as provided in the routine (though this can go to 3 T2 exercises and 4 T3 exercises).

I wanted to keep my running habits consistent while running the program, though it turned out to be a bit too much (especially during the days where I'd run at night after running the routine) so I cut my running down to 4-10km per day for the weekend during the second block (week 7 - 12). I also started wearing a belt when deadlifting which helped an enormous amount, though would only do it one the set which was my calculated rep max at a specific week.

Think it's better to read the program itself to get a feel of how it works rather than typing it up, though this was my typical routine:

&#x200B;

|T1|T2A|T2b|T3A|T3B|T3C|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Deadlift|Lat Pulldowns|Cable Rows|Hammer Curls|V-Bar Curls|Weighted Ab Crunches|
|Bench Press|Incline DB Press|OHP|Dips|Side DB Raises|Cable Crossovers|
|Squats|Leg Press|Hip Thrusts|Leg Curls|Leg Extensions|Weighted Ab Crunches|
|OHP|Bench Press|Incline Bench Press|Side DB Raises|Dips|Cable Crossovers|
|Deadlifts|Weighted Pull-ups|Cable Rows|Hammer Curls|V-Bar Curls|Weighted Ab Crunches|

**Diet**

Won't lie I was pretty lax in terms of diet. All I cared about was getting in 160g of protein a day and didn't care about how I got it, even through KFC/Maccas, as long as I reached my protein intake (which explains the weight gain). Definitely could've cleaned up my eating habits for (potentially?) better results looking back.

Mornings typically consistent of a mix of 1 scoop of pea protein, 1 scoop of rice protein (bought a few too many bags after watching The Game Changers late last year...), 1 banana, almond milk and frozen berries. Also some coffee to wake me up for work.

Lunch would typically consist of pre-made meals from a food delivery company (Mymusclechef) and another coffee.

Typically the above would get me to around 95-105g of protein per day, and I'd cover the remainder of the intake however I wanted.

**Progress**

||Starting 1RM|Pre-COVID lockdown 1RM|Finishing 1RM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Body weight|93kg/205lb||96kg/212lb|
|Deadlift|150kg/330lb|165kg/364lb|210kg/452lb|
|Bench|110kg/242lb|112.5kg/248lb|125kg/275lb|
|Squat|110kg/242lb|120kg/265lb|140kg/308lb|
|OHP|50kg/110lb|65kg/143lb|75kg/165lb|

Starting 1RM for my OHPs were low mainly due to neglect after coming back from lockdown leading up to that point.

**Thoughts/Comments**

* As noted in the daily thread, very happy with the program, especially with my progress across the board as my primary goal was to gain back the strength I lost from COVID lockdown.
* Very fun program with the right amount of volume for me personally - I really liked the concept with T1 exercises where you work towards the specified rep max of the week and the changes from that (e.g. starting from 10RM in week 1 and progressing downwards). Think that really helped in making gains to my T1 lifts.
* This program eats up a lot of time honestly (especially doing the T3s) and I found myself spending more time in the gym than I had before.
* In terms of progression, given the varied rep maxes per week I would pump my numbers into a rep max calculator and make incremental increases per week/two weeks. E.G. for week 1 I did 110kg deadlifts for 10RM, and when putting that in the strength calculator [here](https://strengthlevel.com/one-rep-max-calculator) it projects my 8RM to be 117.3kg. So by week 2 I would be aiming to doing 8RM at 120kg (as this incrementally increased the amount I lifted) and judged by feel as to whether I could lift more at any given week.
* Around the second block I noticed I had some tightness in my lower back - no pain/strain/etc, just felt fairly tight which was mildly uncomfortable. However it all went away once I started stretching my glutes and hamstrings everyday (after reading somewhere that it may be the cause) which I thought was pretty interesting.
* As noted previously, part of the reason why my deadlift shot up by so much was due to changing my grip for my rep max sets (alternate grip) + starting to wear a belt around week 10 or so.
* I know my squat is absolute poverty, but a personal goal of mine was to clear 3 plates for 1 rep which I ended up doing in week 12 which was probably one of the best feelings I've had at the gym. Clearing 4 plates for deadlifts felt pretty good too.
* I am not jacked because I ate like a fat shit, nor am I tanned because lockdown has made me reach all time pasty levels. I do stress that this is not at the fault of the program but just me personally lol.

**What's Next?**

* Find a program that will bring my squat up to par (might do Squatober as suggested in a daily thread)
* Start running more again now that my strength is at a level I'm happy at.
* Clean up my diet so I can cut down to a weight in the high 80kgs region.",2020-09-24 16:07:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/iz02il/program_review_jnt_20_by_gzcl/
iad54j,weightroom,[Program Review] My experience with 5/3/1 Big But Boring FSL,"For the past 12 weeks, I’ve been running 5/3/1 Big But Boring with FSL weights for the 5x10 assistance work for my squat, bench, and deadlift. Over the course of this program I: improved my technique on the big three, set multiple rep and all-time weight PRs, and pushed myself harder than I’ve ever had to while fixing glaring issues I’ve had in training prior.

Empirical Data:
1. Body weight moved from 146 to 155.6lbs. I could’ve gained more, but I hate cutting and don’t want to do it till next year so I’ve intentionally gone a little slower in gaining. I’d like to slowly get up to the 170s by maybe the end of 2020.
2. My TMs at the beginning were simply 3RMs I had for each lift. Started with S/B/D 265/185/375, and my TMs at the end were 295/200/405.
3. I set new 10RMs on all three. 221lbs for the squat, 151lbs for the bench, and 305lbs for the deadlift. I set smaller rep PRs through, such as squatting 255x8 (that was my 5RM when I started), and pulling 365x7 (my deadlift 5RM when I started was 355lbs).
4. Since the TMs kept increasing to weights I’d never touched, the higher percentages became PRs for me. Squat 3RM went from 265lb to 281lbs; bench 5RM 175lbs to 191lbs (3RM is an estimated ~202lbs up from 185lbs); and deadlift 3RM 375lbs to 385lbs.
5. I ate between 2800-3200 calories throughout. This variation is due to volume on conditioning days vs lifting, eating out, and a week off (I’ll explain).

The Program:
Obviously the lifting is 531 BBB. That’s the base program and 5x10 assistance work at a programmed weight. I chose FSL because Wendler said you need “big cajones” to pull it off and damn it I wanted the glory. There is none, it just hurts, but I feel like since I completed it, I at least did earn my “big cajones”.

Seriously work up to the FSL version if you haven’t done similar work. I ran Deep Water before this but the last deadlift workout of each 3 week mini-cycle still almost killed me each time. 10 reps just always fucking sucks, except on bench days because it sucks BUT you get a bitchin’ pump.

The assistance work is where I deviated. Still did his recommended movements (chins, rows, sit ups), but week 1-6 I did 5x10 and weeks 7-12 I did 10x10 chins, 5x20 rows, and big sets of 100 for sit ups. The high rep back work also contributes to the bitchin’ pump on bench day. Building up my back strength and size here did wonders for my bench and squat and didn’t hinder my recovery too hard.

When I’m not lifting I box, so my boxing training (running, bags, etc) doubled as conditioning here.

Diet:
I ate a fucking ton of ground beef (600g per day), a ton of eggs (usually 8-12 per day), rice, veggies, and cured meats like salami. Processed foods were limited to protein bars, shakes, basically anything “with a purpose” as u/MythicalStrength once said in a nutrition post. I ate almost the exact same thing every day, except sometimes instead of eggs I’d have more meat or vice versa. Like I said, this worked out to around 2800-3200 calories depending on what else I was eating that day or if I was out with friends. I personally felt better eating carbs on this program than I did when I was eating almost none during Deep Water. I also think this is setting me up for an easier cut in the future: when its time for me to drop weight, I’ll just drop the carbs. My body is already used to low carb from Deep Water, so right now I can reap the benefits of carbs and suffer minimal side effects when I need the benefit (less calories) of no carbs to cut.

There were some psychological gains here, as before I just lived and died by my calorie counting app. On this program I was straining and working hard enough that some days I knew I needed a little more food and other days I needed less. It’s the first time I’ve developed that sort of “knowing” how much fuel I need for what. This was one of my glaring issues, and is the first program to really drive me to understand eating on a more fundamental level.

General Thoughts:
- Doing the 5x10 stuff at moderately heavier weights did a lot for my technique and bracing. When the weight is just slightly too heavy for comfort (like it is a lot on this program), you can’t really afford to have a form/technique breakdown or you’re gonna get hurt. The weights forcing me to always be bracing and breathing right, always be in the right position, and always be pacing myself accordingly taught me how to stay in place and use the right movement patterns throughout sets. Stuff like engaging the lats, keeping my upper back tight on a squat, head down on a deadlift. This was another glaring issue this program helped me fix.
- I didn’t time my rest times all that religiously because you really do need to recover between the FSL sets during the 3s and 531 week. When I did time them (erring to the shorter side), the sets obviously became much harder and that led to the aforementioned form/technique breakdown best avoided here.
- I was sore for 12 weeks on this program. Seriously, the squats and deadlifts were murder on the posterior chain.
- I learned I didn’t need a dedicated preworkout during this program. I went from my 200mg of caffeine Mr. Hyde supplement to just a Red Bull or a coffee.
- On the aforementioned “week off” from the first paragraph: I got a concussion half way through this. Missed a week of training but it didn’t really hinder me, came back and pulled a rep PR. I just ate at maintenance that week.
- This much squatting and deadlifting at higher weights admittedly did nothing good for my nagging shoulder and hip pain. Unless I’m in wrist wraps and a specific position, the low bar squat is unbearable for my right shoulder. Had I been in my normal gym instead of basement I would’ve done some facepulls to help this, or if I had bands some band pull-aparts.
- I watched a lot of Dave Tate vids, and his video on wrist wraps ultimately taught me how to maximize the benefit of the shitty RDX ones I have and led me to buy a pair from him.
- I used to use blocks of chalk to “paint” my hands, but at some point during this program between deadlift sets I just crushed the block and started using the powder. This is WAY better as it covers more of it, gets into the crevices, and physically puts more chalk on my hand. It also makes me feel better purely psychologically because my brain has seen many other people stronger than me do it.
- I wish my last set of deadlifting at 385lbs was a new 5RM. The fact I really only added 10lbs to the 3RM is unfortunate.

Wait, where’s your press?
I started this in my basement with limited plate inventory. So when I started, I didn’t have the plates necessary to work at percentages of my press. So I opted for a fixed weight on the press and did Deep Water Intermediate. Progress was good here: went from doing 95lbs for a sets of 10 to 105lbs for a set of 16 over the course of 12 weeks. I definitely saw shoulder growth here, but I didn’t really enjoy this as much as 5/3/1. I want a big press though, and I feel like after a few cycles of 5/3/1 whatever I built with this work is gonna show in a big way.

The Not To Distant Future:
I REALLY like 5/3/1. I’m gonna stick with it, probably running something with even more volume after this. Between now and then, I have one week off where I’ll be going to a cottage with some friends for a few days, doing a few short shifts at work, and some boxing and conditioning work. This is mostly just a change for me to recover, because like I said my shoulder and hip are worse for wear and I’m burnt out. The top contenders for the next program are either 5/3/1 GVT or Spinal Tap Training (all of 5/3/1 in one day).

I struggled with what to set my next TMs as for the next one. Following my plan at the original start of the program, they should just be a weight I can do for 3-5 reps again. That would mean I’m not just gonna increase the 5 and 10lbs again and make them 305/205/415: those are probably above even my 1RM right now. So I’m stepping back and using just about the weights I got for my final 1+ sets on the program. That means I’m starting my next 5/3/1 cycle with TMs of 285/195/385. These are all weights I can do for 3-5 reps, and all higher numbers than my starting TMs from 12 weeks ago. I know the TM isn’t a measure of strength, but it being higher than my start even after a few steps back (which Jim discusses in 2nd Edition) is satisfying.

Thanks for reading, and sorry if this is a trash write up but it’s the first I’ve ever done. If you have any thoughts on this or experience with 5/3/1 I’d really like to hear it as a noob to the program.",2020-08-15 18:56:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/iad54j/program_review_my_experience_with_531_big_but/
hucgxr,weightroom,[Program Review] A trip through 2.5 years of programming and what I've learned,"**Introduction**

I vividly remember when my journey first began. I got out of the shower one night and walked past the mirror, completely in the nude. I stopped and stared at my frail 6'0 160-pound body. There was no resentment, I did not hate myself or my body. Nor was I aching for a vastly better-looking physique. Instead I had one of my most introspective thoughts ever, *""You can do better than this.""*

That night I stayed up way too late eating up everything I could on r/fitness. Eventually I settled on a 6-day Arnold split. I chose it because well obviously Arnold is big and I want to be like Arnold, so therefore I must lift like Arnold. So that week I began my lifting journey [looking like this](https://imgur.com/a/IQgqZMe), benching around 165, squatting 2 plates, and pulling just about 2 plates as well (I had a little experience in the weight room because of football).

**First 6 Months of Jacking Off**

Looking back, I consider my first 6 months in the gym a failure. Although I made significant progress, my 16 year old brain made me lift too damn heavy with shitty form, and my programming was pretty whack. I ran the reddit 4 day split, and I really wish I had focused on a power lifting program. Overall though [progress was coming in and I was feeling great](https://imgur.com/a/4dCcsSs), and I ended up gaining about 15 pounds. However, I knew I was still weak and had a lot in front of me.

**Intro to Power Lifting & Building the Monolith**

*NOTE; I have never competed in a meet unfortunately. I was expected to in May, but COVID interrupted.*

After my first 6 months I stumbled across /r/weightroom. I was so god damn relieved to find a subreddit with real power lifters and actual articles. I lurked and read everything I could; I became addicted to learning everything I could about lifting.

Then one day I saw a stickied post. *PROGRAM PARTY* it said, and the curiosity bug bit me. I read through the Building the Monolith program and scoffed at it. *A fucking pound and a half of beef a day PLUS a dozen eggs?* I ignored it. But I remember it eating away at me, as I thought I had let this challenge best me. Sure enough, on day one of the Program Party, with much of this subreddit joining me, I wolfed down my pound and a half of beef and 12 eggs. That night I nearly vomited. But I kept with it and finished the program without missing a beat. And the results were amazing, I gained mass but more importantly my lifts shot up. I was benching 2 plates, squatting 315, and pulling 350. Most importantly Building the Monolith introduced me to smart programming, which would be one of the most important aspects of my lifting journey. [This was me after the 6 weeks of Building the Monolith](https://imgur.com/a/inBoSyl). I believe I weighed around 185.

**nSuns and Getting Strong**

After my Building the Monolith cycle I was hungry for a new program. Eventually I found the nSuns 5-day plan. My first day I fell in love. This was gonna stick with me for a while.

I loved the linear progression of nSuns and having everything written in stone meant that I had to do it, no excuses. With my newfound discipline in the kitchen I learned from Building the Monolith, my lifts skyrocketed. I was finally moving some god damn weight. Towards the end of my nSuns cycle I was benching right around 275, squatting 405, and pulling 500. But I was starting to struggle. My lifts began not to move, and I was starting to feel fatigued in the gym. I like to think it was because I finally got to the end of my beginner gains rations, but really, I think it is because I started to get bored of nSuns. [This is what I looked like towards the end of nSuns. I weighed about 195.](https://imgur.com/a/o0fef7e)

**nSuns CAP3 and Strength Maturity**

Following my nSuns bout, I adopted CAP3. I want to start off by saying that this is an excellent program for an intermediate lifter. I stuck with it for a while, and my lifts were starting to finally get pretty damn good. I was benching around 330, squatting 460-ish, and pulling somewhere in the mid 500’s. I was satisfied, and I started to finally feel like someone could ask me questions about power lifting, and I could actually give solid advice. Around this time, me and my dad also put together our home gym, which was awesome. I could finally hit shirtless double bi’s between sets and scream during sets. Life was good.

**The Modern Age & Diet**

Nowadays I am running Alan Thrall's 4-day RPE based program with some of my own little modifications. My lifts are sitting at a [500 squat (outdated)](https://streamable.com/1jjyz6), [350 bench](https://streamable.com/zyxbgo), [600-ish deadlift](https://streamable.com/re2la1) (this is a video of me hitting 565 a few months ago, I simply cannot fit more on my bar with these damn bumper plates), [225 OHP](https://streamable.com/83tqen), and a [405](https://streamable.com/xkaaiu) front squat. [This is my current physique. I am sitting at 208.](https://imgur.com/a/Gq5O4EL)

For diet nowadays I aim for roughly 3,500 calories a day. No, I do not count, but an average day goes something like this.

**6:00 AM**: Wake up, coffee, lift.

**8:30 AM**: Protein shake; two cups whole milk, two scoops protein, creatine, and psyllium husk (life changing)

**11:00 AM**: Breakfast. 5 eggs and either some rice or two slices of toast. Whatever veggies I can get my hands on. Might have a cup of whole milk, might not.

**1:00 PM**: Lunch. Rice and about half a pound of ground beef. Random veggies.

**4:00 PM**: Lunch number two. Same deal as my first lunch, just probably a smaller portion.

**7:00 PM**: Dinner. Varies a ton day to day, but generally just some meat with some source of carbs. Could also be something I eat out with buddies. Who knows, my most flexible meal for sure.

**10:00 PM**: Snack before bedtime, usually canned sardines, or a tuna salad. Something that goes down easy just to keep me in check overnight.

*MY DIET IS NOT SET IN STONE!*, this is just an average day of eating for me, some days it’s a lot more some days it’s less. All I know is generally, I stay on top of it.

Overall, I feel like the past 2 years have been fruitful. I found a hobby I will cherish for a lifetime. I began lifting during the most confusing time in a man’s life, at the ripe age of 16. Lifting taught me discipline, in fact my grades in high school are directly correlated with my lifting progression. My confidence as a man skyrocketed, and I am far more comfortable in my body nowadays.

As I head into college this year, I cannot wait to see how my lifting progresses. Every session I think *""how strong will I be in a year?""* It is what keeps me going. At 18 years old, I like to think I am nowhere near my maximum potential. I get giddy thinking about how much more I got in the tank.

If I could do it all again, I would have started off power lifting from the get-go. I would have gone on r/weightroom as opposed to r/fitness, and I would have found a plan that was proven to work and stuck with it. Of course, hindsight is always 20/20.

For all the teenagers reading this post in my position 2 years ago here’s what I’ll say; find a program on this subreddit, *and go pick some heavy ass weight off the ground.* Make sure you put it down too.",2020-07-20 01:35:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/hucgxr/program_review_a_trip_through_25_years_of/

exhxyw,weightroom,[Program review] Nsuns 4-day with OHP T1,"Hi there! I didn't see many program reviews of Nsuns, so I figured I'd do one now that I've finished a three-month block (13 or 14 weeks), although I made some tweaks. This is my first program review, and I've only been lifting for about a year, so I'm a lot less experienced than a lot of people here, but hopefully this can help give fellow beginners who are considering hopping onboard this high-volume linear progression program a sense of what's involved. It proved very successful for me.

**Background**

I've been lifting for about a year, although I started in awful shape after some health issues. Started at 315 and lost about 70 lbs. over the past year while lifting at the same time. Mid-30s male, 5'10"".

I decided to swap to Nsuns after a 3-month PHUL stint. I enjoyed PHUL and saw some solid strength gains, but I was cutting while running it, and while I was successfully still pushing up my working weights every week thanks to those sweet noob gains, I was feeling pretty beat up by the end of it. Elbows hurt constantly, shoulders were sore, I kept picking up nagging minor tweaks. So I wanted to switch to something submaximal in 531-like fashion, but still focused on linear progression. I don't mind high volume, so Nsuns seemed perfect, although I modified it a bit to fit my desires. After a long stretch of cutting, I ran the program on a bulk to clear up my nagging aches and pains and take advantage of those sweet sweet holiday feasts and leftover turkey sandwiches.

**Starting stats**

5'10"" male, 246 lbs

* Box squat 200 training max (TM)
* Bench 165 TM
* Deadlift 270 TM
* OHP 120 TM

**Nsuns overview**

Nsuns comes in 4-day, 5-day, and 6-day versions, which you can [find here](http://archive.is/2017.01.27-015129/https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5icyza/2_suns531lp_tdee_calculator_and_other_items_all/). It basically condenses an entire 531 cycle into a single primary lift day, so you'll be doing 9 working sets for your main lift. Like 531, it bases your lifts off of a training max (TM) that's 90% of your 1 rep max. As Many Reps As Possible (AMRAP) sets help you gauge progress. This is a linear progression program, so you'll be adding weight to the bar every week (ideally). How many reps you get on your main AMRAP set tells you how much to add next time around.

The program also has a higher-volume, lower-intensity secondary lift based (I think?) on Sheiko rep protocols, having you do 8 total sets: two work-up sets of 5 or 6, depending on the lift, and then sets of 357468. These secondary lifts are variants of the primary ones. On extra bench volume day, OHP is a secondary lift, while close-grip bench is the secondary lift on your max-effort bench day. You'll also do front squats on deadlift day, and sumo deadlifts on squat day.

Those high-rep deadlifts can take some getting used to. The lower body days can be brutal if you didn't catch enough sleep or otherwise trip up on your recovery somehow.

Nsuns prescribes assistance work types depending on which version of the program you select. Rather than spelling out exact lifts and sets x reps, it just tells you which body parts to focus on that day—so arms, chest, back, et cetera. I swapped various exercises out for these monthly or whenever I got bored, but still focused on progressing them. I also put my own spin on things by doing a 3x8-12 dumbbell variant of the primary lift of the day (incline DB bench on bench day, dumbbell RDLs on deadlift day, etc) after the primary and secondary sets were done, for aesthetic and unilateral balance reasons. On lower body days, I also threw in high pulls and hip thrusts.

Specific conditioning work isn't spelled out either, but if you frequent this sub, you'll know Nsuns (the man) is a big fan of it. I walked 4 to 8 miles five days most weeks, and did loaded trap bar carries on the lower body days.

Nsuns also created a TDEE calculator and INOL heatmap to assist with the program, but I didn't use those, so I can't speak to them.

**What I did different**

I did the 4-day version of Nsuns, but ditched the volume bench day to make OHP a T1 instead. As a large dude trying to get down to a reasonable weight, I find wider shoulders give me the illusion of being slimmer than I really am, and that's important to me right now. So my upper body days alternated between T1 OHP/ T2 flat bench, and vice versa. I did incline DB bench after the primary and secondary sets were done on each upper body day to try and make up for the lack of variants caused by switching to an OHP focus. On weeks when I ate a lot and felt good, I sometimes did an extra Saturday session with ramp-up CG bench to get that in when possible as well, along with some extra arm work, as that didn't affect my recovery too much. I wound up doing it every other week or so.

After the first month, I changed the sets and reps scheme for the secondary lifts too. Keeping track of which set I was on, and how many reps I needed to do, wound up being too much mentally that many sets into a workout, especially since I did this early morning before work. (NEED MOAR COFFEE.) I was recovering nicely, so I swapped the secondary lifts from 65357468 to a 531 BBB-style straight 5x10, but still used the weight prescribed by Nsuns. It winds up being a bit more volume, but I held up fine and was able to keep track of it a lot better. It sped up the workout by a decent bit, too.

I also threw in an extra secondary set of rows each day, often supersetted with the other secondary lift, because ain't no back like a strong back. On upper days, I stuck to 5x8-12 DB rows, and went with heavier BB or trap bar rows on lower body days, using various grips. I'm a fatty and can't do pull-ups yet. 2020 goals!

**How long was each workout?**

It's hard to say how long each session really took, alas. I split my assistance work into a second session each day, so I was able to do more, fresher. (I have a home gym and do my primary lifts in the morning. At night, while my wife works out, I do assistance.) I could get all the primary and secondary lifts done in an hour or less though, taking two to three minutes of autoregulated rest between sets. I spent about half an hour on assistance work each night, depending on how I was feeling. Superset as much as you can, as often as you can. It's good for both time and improving your work capacity.

**Recovery**

I get a full 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Diet-wise, I lean very protein heavy because it's hard hitting 1g per lb when you're big and interested in getting smaller. Chicken breasts, turkey sausage, fruits, greens, and sweet potatoes, with a 2-scoop protein shake (50g) and creatine each day. Dinner's whatever we make for the family. Since I ran this over the busy holiday season, I ate out a lot and snuck my kids' Halloween candy when I felt hungry, but without worrying about counting those calories like I normally would. I wound up gaining about 12 lbs over the 13- or 14-week period I ran Nsuns. Not a slow bulk whatsoever, but not bad with all the holiday temptations and parties and party drinks around.

**Results**

* Box squat 200 TM > 310 TM
* Bench 165 TM > 205 TM
* Deadlift 270 TM > 385 TM
* OHP 120 TM > 155 TM
* Weight 246 lbs > 258

Those are TMs, but after I wrapped up Nsuns, I hit actual 1rm reps of 3-plate squat and 4-plate deadlift. Only bench is keeping me from 1234.

I didn't take any photos of my progress, as I didn't originally intend to do a program review and still feel weird taking pictures of myself as a lifelong jigglypuff. That said, I experienced noticeable size gains, particularly in my ""upper shelf"" (chest/traps/shoulders) and back thickness. My butt and quads are getting tighter in my pants, though they still fit around my waist just fine. Arms got bigger, too. Can finally see my tricep horseshoe!

**What would I do differently?**

Nothing, really. I'm ecstatic about the results, both in raw strength and aesthetics, and I feel like the tweaks I made fit my needs at this time. Opting for a submaximal program and easing my cut was smart too. Despite the high volume and linear progression, I never felt beat up on Nsuns like I did on PHUL.

Even though I made tweaks, I suggested doing the program as written if OHP isn't a particular focus for you.  My bench started stalling more frequently towards the end of my run with Nsuns, and I suspect it wouldn't have so much if I stuck to all the benching prescribed by the program normally.  I could just also be nearing the end of my newbie gains. OHP kept creeping up consistently, however.

**Bottom line**

If you have the time and work capacity to hold up to Nsuns, and you can still take advantage of linear progression, definitely consider giving this program a whirl. It kicks ass. Thank you, Nsuns, for creating this wonderful program and giving me a big-time love/hate relationship with high-rep deadlifts.",2020-02-02 03:13:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/exhxyw/program_review_nsuns_4day_with_ohp_t1/
dx2eqy,weightroom,[Program Review] Original 5/3/1 Challenge,"Hey guys, this is my first program review. If you notice anything that needs more/less/better explanation, let me know!

# Program Summary

Unlike majority of the programs in 5/3/1 Forever, the Original 5/3/1 Challenge is a total template which includes jumps/throws, conditioning, and assistance work. It is comprised of two leaders and two anchors and lasts 12 weeks. The training maxes increase the usual amount after each wave. The assistance and conditioning increase in difficulty and/or volume during the anchors. The program uses calisthenics assistance, running, and the sled/prowler.

This program is 12 weeks long, I ran it for 1 cycle and added a 13th test week. It consists of 3 strength days and 3 conditioning days per week. I did not miss a single workout. There were some weeks where I went away or had an event, so I had to do a few 12 day streaks. I work full time and I am going for a masters too, so the only way I have time to train is if I wake up at 3:30 to get to the gym by 4. You either make time or make excuses.

# Training History

I'm going to spare the last decade of nonsense and just report the last year and a half. In August 2018 I had just finished 3 months of Greg Nuckols 28 free programs. I entered a local strongman competition in the Novice B weight class (read: fat and weak). After not coming in last place (4th out of 5) I was feeling good about myself and decided to join the r/weightroom Building the Monolith program party. During week 2 of the program I sprained my left SI-Joint, which put me out of the gym for 2 months. When I recovered, I ran three cycles of Juggernaut 2.0 and two waves of 5/3/1 Forever BBB to get back up to my old numbers.

# Why This Program

That sprain wasn't my first injury, and it gave me a lot of time to think about how just how poor of an athlete I was. Even though I took the time to learn good technique and bracing on Juggernaut, I still came out the other end pudgy and unconditioned. Somewhere along the line I decided that I wanted to be able to run 2 miles, do 20 push ups, and do 5 chin ups, as if these were somehow markers of good health. When I found this program in Jim's book it promised a way to reach these new goals without sacrificing strength.

# Stats

I started and ended the program as a 27 year old, 6' tall, 275 pound man.

Belted Squat 345 -> 405 [https://imgur.com/gallery/lrOwgGg](https://imgur.com/gallery/lrOwgGg)

Bench Press 250 -> 265

Belted Deadlift 465 -> 505 [https://imgur.com/gallery/57jBEDO](https://imgur.com/gallery/57jBEDO)

OHP 165x5 -> 170x2 (Decrease in performance)

1.5 mile time \~38:00 -> 22:35 (I'll explain later)

My rest times between sets also greatly reduced from 3-5 minutes to 2-3:30.

# Main Work

This program only has 5/3/1 sets and reps. If you want to get better, you only get 1 chance to push as hard as possible. This method of training completely warped my mentality and I love it.

I do not train with a belt.  All my deadlifts were hook grip with athletic tape and chalk. For overhead press, I would hang clean the first rep of each set. Bench reps were all short paused or TnG depending on the day.

My heaviest/best sets during training were:

Squat: 285x10, 315x4,

Bench: 225x6,

DL: 405x4,

OHP: 150x7.

# Assistance Work

The leader template has you do 100 push ups or dips, 75 chin ups, and 5x10 back extensions or ab wheel roll outs (alternating) every single day. The anchor template requires a weighted vest and drops to 50 push ups or dips, 50 chin ups, and 5x10 back extensions or ab wheel roll outs.

I am overweight which means I am basically a weighted vest already.

During the leader template I did regular push ups and band assisted chin ups (-100 pounds). I did 10 sets of each for max reps superset with each other. :60 rest between sets. The ab wheel and back extensions were unweighted.

During the anchor template I did band resisted push ups (+30 pounds) and band assisted chin ups (-80 pounds). I did 8 sets of each for max reps superset with each other. :60 rest between sets. I did band resisted back extensions (+80 pounds) and did not change the ab wheel at all.

# Conditioning (Running)

Tues/Thurs were running days. The leader template has you run a mile any way you can. The anchor template bumps that up to 1.5 miles.

I chose to break this up by running a quarter mile, catching my breath, then repeating until I hit the goal for the day. The times I listed in the stats section include the .15 mile walking warm up, and all the rest between the quarter mile runs. My total travel distance wound up being around 2-3 miles, but I only actually ran 1.5. My final running session I managed to do three half mile runs instead of six quarters. The goal is to continue adding distance and minimizing rest until I can hit 2 miles straight.

# Conditioning (Prowler/Sled)

Every Saturday was the worst day of my life. The leader requires ten 40-yard runs with a prowler @ 75% bodyweight. The anchor bumps this up to 15.

At my gym we have a strip of turf that's about 40 feet long. Instead of 40-yard sprints, I would sprint to one side, take the handles off the sled, put them on the other side of the sled, then push the whole thing back. This was exceptionally shitty because I had to push the sled from a dead stop twice per run. Also I didn't realize that 75% of bodyweight was supposed to include the weight of the sled. For those counting at home, this means that I put 205 pounds on a 75 pound sled. Whoops.

# Diet and Supplementation

By my weight to strength ratio, anyone can tell that my diet isn't great. All I do is make sure I hit the amount of protein I need and then eat whatever I want. I also drink pretty heavily every Friday or Saturday.

I supplement with 5-10g of creatine a day and I drink a cup of coffee before the gym. If I feel like I can't get all my protein from food, I will grab a protein shake from a corner store. That's it. No pre-workout or anything else.

# Discussion

A lot of this training was mental. Making the 5/3/1 sets count means you have to really push. The calisthenics portion took about 40 minutes to complete because I could not let myself leave unless I hit the rep standards. This is the same with running and the sled. Even if I took an extra minute between sets or ended up just walking the sled back, I put the required work in. I think building this ability to put 100% of myself into a set or workout was what gave me the ridiculous PRs on squat and DL.

My bench was stuck at 250 for over a year. I think it's pretty obvious that doing 300 push ups a week is what gave me that 15 pound PR. Similarly, there's no OHP volume at all, which is probably why I regressed on it.

# Conclusion

If you are consistent, push yourself, and remain uninjured for long enough, you will make great gains. 

This schedule works well for me right now so next up is probably Five and Dime or a 5x5/3/1 3-day variant.

dqmrp8,weightroom,Questions to Ask Yourself as an Intermediate Lifter (very long),"The intermediate period is an exciting time in a lifter’s career. It is the stage where the trainee can begin applying what he or she has learned towards making training decisions. The process of making these decisions can shape one’s lifting paradigms for years to come, and in order to make these decisions successfully, the lifter must have some requisite self-knowledge. Here, the trainee also begins to define his or her relationship with lifting. This write-up is geared towards the inquisitive, analytical, and thoughtful lifter who has some solid experience in the gym and is ready to examine his or her training as well as to consider some potentially difficult questions. Throughout this write-up, please remember that no answer to any of these questions is ever set in stone, because as you change and grow as a person, so may your answers. I also caution you against paralysis by analysis, because even though introspection and consideration are important, being in the gym and working hard are more so. The opinions expressed here are my own and are based on my personal experience and the experiences of lifters around me. As always, caveat emptor.  
  
**What do I want to do?**  
  
As a beginner, your primary job was to build a base. First and foremost, this base contains several sets of foundational knowledge regarding training. For example, the motor skills for performing the big lifts, the tenets of recovery and nutrition and the understanding of principles such as progressive overload that drive your programming, as well as the psychological skills necessary to push yourself are all parts of your psychomotor, cognitive, and affective domains of learning, respectively. You have also likely undergone some physiological changes as an adaptation to training. You’re more muscular, leaner, and stronger than you were when you first walked into the gym, possibly much more so than you imagined yourself becoming when you put your hands on a barbell for the first time.  
  
Because most beginner programs strive to build this base (at least if they’re worth following), your “beginner base” is probably not too different from another person’s beginner base. If your initial program was focused primarily on, say, improving low-rep strength on squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press with some low-volume, medium-rep assistance lifts and your friend was on a higher volume “bodybuilding” type program, you might look and function slightly differently, but at the end of the beginner stage, both bases are perfectly appropriate for whatever type of training you choose to pursue. The main point is that the foundations must be built by the end of the beginner stage, and if they aren’t, they need to be developed further until they are solid enough to progress to the intermediate level.  
  
This is an excellent time to consider the question I propose. Another way to think about this question is “What do I most want to get out of training?” There are lots of possible answers including strength, aesthetics, sports performance, health, stress relief, fun, challenge, and self-improvement. This is not an exhaustive list, and your answer will likely contain elements from more than one of these items. However, the answer you come up with is going to guide the general direction of your training. The program or method you use to attain maximal numbers in the squat, bench press, and deadlift will be drastically different than one used to make yourself stage-ready or as healthy and fit as possible, and it will result in different physiological and psychological adaptations over time. Of course, you always have the option of changing your direction at any point in your lifting career, but if you don’t pick one to start with, you’re more likely to flounder and stall early on.  
  
**How far do I want to go?**  
  
Lifting, like any pursuit, can be taken as seriously as you like. It can be something you enjoy recreationally, something you choose to take as far as you humanly can, or it can fall anywhere in between those two extremes. None of these options are superior to any other, because our worth and value as human beings don’t hinge upon our performance in the gym, nor are they based upon any achievement-based criterion. The only person who decides how this hobby fits into your life is you, and at the end of the day, you have to be at peace with yourself and the choices you’ve made.  
  
Now, answering the question of how far you want to take your training will dictate the size of the space in your life you will have to carve out for it. Big goals and high achievements will naturally demand a larger space for lifting and thus larger sacrifices. If you find yourself watching videos of freaks lifting inhuman weights and wanting more than anything to be able to do better, ask yourself if you’re willing to put in many years of brutal, meticulous training that leaves you too drained to pursue most of your other hobbies, if you’re willing to give up your enjoyment of food so that you may optimize your nutrition, and if you’re willing to restrict your social life so that you can have the proper recovery, amongst other things…without the guarantee that you’ll ever even approach that level of performance. Honest introspection can lead you to a yes, a no, or a maybe, all of which are valid. Perhaps you envision yourself eventually hitting a 1300 gym total, or being lean and healthy at 12% bodyfat, you feel a sense of satisfaction and “completion,” so to speak, when you imagine these things, and you don’t feel like you have to go further than that. That’s perfectly fine, too, because it is the pursuit of becoming more than what you are in any domain of your life that ultimately makes you better. It means that your “internal lifting space” probably won’t have to be as expansive as that of the person chasing massive goals. But the sooner you can answer this question, at least in the medium term, the sooner you can appreciate what it’s going to take to get there, and the quicker and more efficiently you can begin preparing for the road ahead. Your goals and your vision can always change, but you need some to start.  
  
**What have I found to be the most rewarding aspects of lifting? The most challenging?**  
  
Lifting is hard. If it isn’t yet, it will be. For many of us, its inherent difficulty is a major reason we choose to pursue it. Chances are, you’ve experienced a plateau, a setback, or a moment in the gym where you were called to summon more than what you ever thought you had. These things are unavoidable, and as you progress, they will become more common. Ask yourself if the reward you reap from overcoming difficulties in the gym outweighs the frustration you experience from the process. If not, you need to change your mindset, because an imbalance of frustration to reward will lead you to burnout sooner or later.  
  
Contemplate what brings you a sense of reward in the weight room and compare it to what you find the most challenging. If those two answers are closely related to each other, you’re probably in a good spot. Don’t forget to consider factors outside of the gym such as nutrition. Eating enough was always harder than lifting for me for the first several years. Consider how you can tie your frustrations into your rewards, and they will eventually frustrate you less.  
  
**What type of training do I respond best to? What type of training do I enjoy the most? How can I best join the two?**  
By now, you have hopefully run a program or two to completion. If you’ve finished more than one program and they were different enough to invite comparison between them, this is a good time to think about these questions. If you’ve only completed one program or have mostly trained with the same parameters for the major training variables (intensity, volume, and frequency), it may be more challenging to consider these questions as you might not have anything to compare yet.  
  
The further along you are in your lifting career, the more fine-tuned the big three variables will need to be for you to ensure the best response to training. As a beginner, you respond positively to just about everything. As an intermediate, however, you should start to have an idea of whether you are an intensity-responder or a volume-responder. You should also start to appreciate how differences in frequency affect you. Generally, the higher you drive one variable, the more the other two need to be adjusted to allow for proper recovery in a medium to long term program. This is basic periodization, and if you don’t know about it, I recommend you read up on the topic. Some programs will keep two variables high and one low, while a select few intentionally overreach by having all three variables high (Smolov is a great example of this), but these programs are not sustainable except in the short term. Granted, as you progress, your work capacity (tolerance for an increase in the variables) should grow, but everyone has limits. Knowing what type of responder you are will let you choose or design the correct programs for yourself.  
  
However, what do you do if you’re an intensity-responder but enjoy volume training more or vice versa? Progress is critical, and you have to enjoy your time in the gym at least somewhat. If this is the case with you, you’ll have to find a balance between the two factors. For some people, this compromise may be hammering out multiple sets on a main lift with a slightly submaximal intensity. Others may choose to gut out a high intensity set and then do lots of volume on assistance lifts. Eventually, if you start out with a discrepancy and spend enough time training with the style you respond best to, you may come to love it. The answer is in there, but you have to look.  
  
**How willing am I to explore different training paradigms?**  
  
This is a natural follow-up to the previous set of questions, because as you progress through training, you may respond better to different stimuli at different times. If all you’ve ever done is intensity-based training, for example, and you’ve been stalling for a while, despite other factors such as recovery being appropriate, do you have the insight to consider a totally different method? Can you face the unknown and the uncertainty of whether trying something new will work? Are you patient enough to see your effort through?  
  
If you’re in the gym and you’re training with any degree of seriousness, you must be comfortable being uncomfortable. Intuitively, you know this, because you feel it every time you subject yourself to the weights. A major change in training, such as from an intensity-based to a volume-based approach, even temporarily, is a big step that forces you to think about training in a new way. You must have the mental flexibility and adaptability to deal with such paradigm shifts, because if you train long enough, it won’t be a question of “if,” but “when.”  
  
Beware of taking this too far and becoming a program hopper. Being open to and able to change is a trait. Knowing when to do so judiciously and methodically is a skill.  
  
**Where do I generally struggle with my lifts?**  
  
You have probably identified some patterns related to how you miss your lifts. If you haven’t, start looking, because you will need this information in order to figure out how to improve.
  
Let’s consider a broad example. By the time you’re an intermediate, you can probably identify whether you are better at grinding reps or being fast. Most people are naturally better at one over the other, and one will seem much more natural and intuitive. Having both skills is necessary to lift big weights, but one (or both, if you’re unlucky) will take a lot of effort and practice to develop. Personally, I was always an explosive lifter, but it took me years to learn how to grind. To this day, I will lift just about everything fast, have a small range with maximal weights where I can grind successfully, and beyond that I will most likely miss the lift. That “small grinding range” didn’t start coming through until about six years into lifting for me, and it’s expanding ever so slowly so that I can grind just a little longer than I used to every year. Some people will be very fast with some lifts and be very good at grinding others. You have to hammer whatever your weakness is consistently. However, don’t neglect to continue to improve your strength. If you’re an explosive lifter, keep getting faster. The two abilities feed into each other, even if one is far ahead of the other.  
  
This is a good time to assess your form deficits as well as to start thinking about “weak muscles,” weak movement patterns, mobility issues if you have them, how these factors might feed into each other, and how to rectify the issues. Going into detail here is beyond the scope of this write-up, and there are tons of resources out there for you to investigate once you have some hypotheses. Don’t forget about potential psychological reasons for missing lifts. I have touched upon these briefly in my AMRAPs write-up and may go into more detail at a later date.  
  
**Am I an animal, a technician, or a machine?**  
  
The terms “animal, machine, technician” are not my inventions, and were introduced to me by a fellow lifter about seven years ago. I do not know if these terms were this lifter’s creation, but I want to give credit where credit is due. I'll use these terms to broadly describe three types of lifters and their thought processes and behaviors while preparing for a set or while under the bar.  
  
An animal is a lifter that frequently summons a great deal of emotion while training, especially in order to perform the most challenging set or rep(s). Animals frequently get psyched up and use this burst of emotion to increase performance. They can draw upon thoughts and memories that have nothing to do with lifting to access the emotions they want. These are the lifters that “take it out” on the bar.  
  
Technicians pay a lot of attention to cues throughout the lift. They may rely primarily on a “master cue” that makes the lift come together, or they may use different cues at different points in the lift to optimize each portion of it. There’s a lot going on in the mind of a technician while he or she is lifting, and they usually keep emotional levels low, as high emotion can disrupt their sequences of cues. Technicians often visualize their lifts extensively prior to approaching the bar.  
  
Machines approach lifts with very little emotion and very little cognitive processing. They usually have an idea of how a lift should feel and will aim to perform a lift in such a way that it fits into that paradigm. Their reps are usually highly consistent in form. A machine will be thrown off by both high emotion and an over-reliance on cues. If a machine is using a cue, he or she will try to integrate it and get it out of conscious thinking as quickly as possible. Prior to a lift, a machine will either try to become as internally empty as possible or might perform a brief visualization of the lift, but not to the extent that the technician does.  
  
Most lifters trend towards one of these categories with some contribution from another or both, and their behavior tends to be consistent. Each style has advantages and disadvantages, which are important to consider if you know what type of lifter you are, and I’ll briefly list them here.  
  
Animals are probably the best at taking a set to its absolute limit, and are the least likely to stop a set because of a lack of self-confidence or another psychological reason. They tend to train hard and are easy to push to train harder. On the other hand, constantly summoning intense emotions in the gym is mentally exhausting. An animal can take a set too far-I have seen lifters like this grinding out rep after rep with progressively deteriorating form and being unable to do anything useful afterward. Excessive emotion can also decrease performance on a motor task, if the task hasn’t been mastered yet. The best animal-type lifters aren’t animals every time they touch a weight. Still, knowing how to be an animal at the right time can be a very powerful tool.  
  
Technicians tend to have good form, are knowledgeable about the lifts, and can explain and analyze them well. They’re good at correcting themselves and determining their weaknesses. Sometimes, though, technicians can fall victim to paralysis by analysis. The over-reliance on cues can throw a lift off, especially if it is becoming automatic, or if the cue in question is no longer suitable or necessary for successful performance of the lift in question. Technicians should take periodic inventory of their cues to determine how appropriate they are and replace or eliminate superfluous or unhelpful ones. Finally, technicians are much more susceptible to psychological factors during a set than animals and must learn to deal with them quickly.  
  
Machines, once they find the technique that works best for them, usually perform the lift in question with a high degree of consistency. Because they use the lowest levels of emotion and conscious cognitive processing while lifting, training takes the least mental toll on them compared to the other types of lifters. Machines, however, may have difficulty describing and explaining a lift or why it felt good or bad. It is much harder for a machine than a technician to notice subtle errors in technique or to see something in their lifts that would call for further analysis or for the exploration of a potential weakness. Like a technician, if a machine experiences excessive emotion during a set, it could throw him or her off. A machine is also vulnerable to being distracted by a cue or by fleeting thoughts and thus needs to learn to keep his or her mind empty during the set.  
  
**How is my recovery?**  
  
This question was, perhaps, not very important to you when you were a beginner and could make progress regardless of what you did outside of the gym. Now, it’s going to start to matter. Refer to the “how far do you want to go?” question. The harder and more you train, the better your recovery needs to be. It may seem like a no-brainer, but it’s easy to forget. Take an honest inventory of your nutrition, sleep, stress levels, and identify factors that could detract from your recovery. Then, after considering this, decide if your level of recovery is commensurate with your answer to “how far do you want to go?” If not, you have some work to do. There are countless resources out there to teach you about improving your recovery. Utilize them.  
  
**Do I train too hard? Not hard enough?**
  
Though your initial reaction may be “I train exactly as hard as I need to,” how hard you train must be proportionate to your goals and your recovery. Those of us who love training for the sake of training, those of us for whom it provides sanity, clarity, and release, often fall into the “train too hard” category. Training, like many things, can provide an escape, and there are few escapes as powerful and visceral as the feeling of your soul leaving your body after a proper set of squats. If “release” is your number one answer to the question of “what do I want to do/why am I in the gym?” then perhaps lifting like that is appropriate for you. Just be aware of the limitations that being human comes with, and appreciate that such training is not sustainable forever. Training too hard is easy to glorify, and sometimes it feels really fucking good despite its potential for destruction. Now is a great time to learn moderation if excessive training is holding you back.  
  
On the other hand, if you’re not progressing, and yet you never feel a sense of accomplishment and relief when you leave the gym, or if you can comfortably wear your gym shirt after you’re done, then perhaps you need to give yourself a kick in the ass. Again, your training needs to be proportionate to your goals and your recovery. Your answer to the question of “why am I in the gym?” might well be “to enjoy my time there and to do fun barbell movements.” I’m not going to shit on you for that answer and neither should anyone else, because if that is honestly what you want, then that’s what you should get. But if your answer is “I want to get significantly stronger” and you can relate to what I have said here, or if you spend a large portion of your workout doing “mobility work” and an equally large portion of it bullshitting with your buddies, then you have an incongruency to resolve. In lifting, as in life, we must seek to resolve such incongruencies wherever they rear their heads, because left unattended, they lead to cognitive dissonance, which nobody wants to live with.  
  
**Is lifting taking over my life?**  
  
This will not be an issue for most of you, but because it will be for at least one of you, it’s worth discussing. What I am going to write here are things I wish I had heard (or listened to) before it was too late for me. For much of my training career, until two or three years ago, lifting completely dominated my life and my identity. It caused my personal growth in all areas of my life to come to a halt. I wasn’t living my life intentionally, but was instead going through the motions, thinking about nothing but what I wanted to experience under the bar. Though I completed college, worked, and appeared to function like a normal person, I wasn’t all there. My relationships suffered, my creative potential was decimated, and I lost touch with most of my many other interests. I was never happy and felt, at best, brief moments of relief when I accomplished my daily goals in the gym. When I had a bad workout, I was devastated. Ironically, once I realized that my relationship with lifting was holding me back and had to change, and once I started to work on improving myself in all the areas I had neglected, my lifts went up significantly. It was only then that I feel I started to come into my own as a lifter.  
  
Seasoned lifters reminisce about the proverbial “bite of the iron bug” with reverence and fondness. This bite is the moment that a lifter realizes that he or she has begun a love affair with the barbell. Like other loves, this one can be profound, powerful, complex, and lifelong. It can be healthy and enriching, or it can be destructive with the potential to lay waste to all the domains of your life. You must take careful inventory of your past relationships, addictions, and behaviors regarding how you participate in the hobbies you enjoy. Be especially diligent in this process if you have an addictive personality, if you tend towards extreme behaviors, and if you have a history of dysfunctional relationships. If you related to the “I train too hard” section, do this right now.  
  
Training, like anything that offers an option for total immersion into itself and a release, can be addictive. It can creep into areas of your life that you might think are completely unrelated to it and take them over. Consider this: Do you have hobbies besides lifting? Can you hold a long conversation about other topics? Can you spend significant periods of time thinking about things completely unrelated to training? How often do you find yourself sacrificing things you don’t want to sacrifice for the sport? Are you still growing as an individual and making progress in other domains of your life? These are hard questions, but they are necessary. If you can’t honestly answer them in a way that reflects the idea that you are a balanced, well-rounded person, I invite you to work on your relationship with the barbell sooner rather than later. Like any relationship, the longer it is unhealthy, the harder it is to change.  
  
**Can I imagine myself being done? What does that feel like?**  
  
Your training career will one day come to an end. Perhaps this means you will be done lifting altogether, or perhaps this means that you won’t be able to train like you can now. Injuries, illnesses, and old age will happen to all of us. Someday, the space that lifting occupies in your life will shrink or disappear completely. This could be due to circumstances completely beyond your control, like the ones I mentioned, or you might choose to fill that space with something else. You do not know who you will be five, ten, or twenty years from now. You also do not know what your relationship with lifting will be at those junctures. Whatever feelings you have towards it today may not be the same, because you won’t be the same.  
  
Can you picture your wrist wraps hanging on a nail in your garage?  
  
Consider two scenarios. In the first, your connection to the barbell is suddenly severed. You can no longer train. The second scenario is a slow fading away. The Iron still calls you, but the best you can do is to sit with it over coffee and remember the best times until it’s gone. Maybe you will be fortunate enough to enjoy that relationship until your last days, or maybe it will stop calling you after your meetings become too brief for too long. How are those different for you? What thoughts and feelings does each possibility inspire?  
  
Imagine yourself with the identity of a lifter stripped away. Do you still exist? Can you go on?
    
I think about these things often, and I feel a strange combination of terror and relief. Coming to terms with these questions is tough, and I have a feeling that I won’t have an answer for them until one of the two scenarios is staring me in the face. I hope that you can confront them and find peace with them early on. There is no love without letting go. I wish that you, after many years of growth and self-actualization with the barbell as one of the countless tools in your arsenal, can look upon your lifting career and upon your life and honestly say, “that was beautiful.”  
  
Thank you.  
  
**TL;DR:** I propose a bunch of training-related and philosophical questions for intermediate trainees to consider in order to have a fruitful lifting career.  
  
I welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions. If you would like me to elaborate on any of these points, please let me know, and if there is enough interest, I'll expound upon them in another write-up. I appreciate suggestions for future write-ups as well.",2019-11-02 16:47:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/dqmrp8/questions_to_ask_yourself_as_an_intermediate/
dpe3oj,weightroom,[Competition Report] Chicago Strength Strongman Challenge 10/26/19,"**My background**

I competed in my first strongman competition in September 2017, at the Central Illinois Strongman Classic. I was the only lightweight novice, so I won (and lost?) by default but had a ton of fun and wanted to get stronger so I could compete in the open category. I also knew I needed to move up to the Middleweight class in order to ever be competitive at a height of 6'.  In June 2018, I did an unsanctioned competition at the Iowa Games, which had novice-like weights, and I came in 3rd/6 at a weight of 186ish lbs. I still didn't feel strong enough for real open weights, so I spent another year getting stronger before competing in strongman again. I've also done two powerlifting meets, mostly recently competing in March 2019, getting an SBD of 468/292/485 @ 188 lbs BW. I've come to find training for powerlifting very boring and don't think that I'll compete in it again, though it is what got me into competitive strength sports. 

**Preparation**

Over the summer, I was able to train at a strongman gym and get lots of time with implements. I ran Brian Alsruhe's Mass Builder program and cultivated quite a lot of mass. At my heaviest, I was 205 lbs, a gain of almost 20 lbs in as many weeks. My strongman PRs over the summer included:

* 250 lb/hand farmer walk for 35 ft
* 600 lb yoke walk for 35 ft
* 15 ft. 320 lb shield carry
* 315 lb stone load
* 220 lb natural stone to shoulder
* 195 lb log press
* 215 lb axle clean

I had a ton of fun bulking hard and doing loads of strongman stuff, but I sadly had to leave my wonderful gym at the start of my next semester of school. This meant being back in a university gym with no implements besides a trap bar. I had put on quite a lot of fat, so I did a cut from August up until my competition with the goal of getting back below 198. This was my first-ever deliberate cut, and it was very easy. It turns out that reducing cutting snacks and weeknight drinking was enough for around 1 lb/week of weight loss. 

Programming-wise, I mostly winged it. I had two days a week with squatting and overhead pressing, one day a week for upper body accessories, and 1 day per week of deadlifting. I had very limited ability to actually practice the events for the meet, but did the best I could. I farmer carried a 480# trap bar about 100 ft and push pressed 225# for the first time one week out. I did some static holds with heavy weights on my back to simulate the yoke, getting 635 lbs for 30 seconds and 545 lbs for a minute. I tried out Zercher holds with a barbell to simulate the Conan wheel, but that didn't work all that well. I could only hold 365 for about 20 seconds before losing feeling in half of my left arm and deciding to stop so that I didn't injure myself. I rigged up a silly-looking ""deficit rack pull"" setup because that was the only way I could get a 15"" pull height to simulate the deadlift event and got 12 reps with quite a lot left in the tank. Overall, I was feeling pretty good about my preparation considering the equipment that I had access to. 

**Meet Goals:**

1. Don't come in last ✅
2. Get at least one clean on the log  ✅
3. Don't zero anything besides the log ✅

**Pre-meet stuff**

I got about 7 hours of sleep, which is pretty good for me. I had a small amount of coffee when I woke up so that I'd poop and be light enough to weigh in under 198. I prepped a huge smoothie, a bunch of black coffee, and a whole bunch of gatorade for my meet nutrition needs. I can never eat solid food when I compete- I just don't feel hungry at all, but I know I need calories and I can consume liquid calories without my stomach rebelling. I weighed in at 196#, and then was able to start mainlining coffee and smoothie. There ended up being a total of 5 MW competitors- two were 198s, and three were 220s. 

**Event 1: 230 lb Log Clean & Press for Reps**

[0 reps (3-way tie for last place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTAIJONAPYDyv-J3wTSt8S-kXZQhgoIE/view?usp=sharing)

I was second for this event, the guy ahead of me got 2 reps. Overhead pressing is far-and-away my biggest weakness, so I knew going in that this would be a zero. This log was over 30 lbs heavier than my log PR, and heavy even than my barbell strict press PR. The clean went surprisingly easy despite me not having touched a log in months. I just didn't have the strength to press the thing. I know that I don't have the greatest form with log- my elbows are way too low- but even then, I'm not strong enough to put up this weight. I set the log down and got two more cleans in, but wasn't remotely close on the press. Two of the other middleweights also couldn't get any reps- this was just really heavy. 

**Event 2: 420 lb Axle Deadlift for Reps**

[8 reps (5th place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ynC_JXnsrAWwkaa8p-PMK7sixQi_YXiw/view?usp=sharing)

This event was originally going to be from a 13-15"" height, but it got changed to from the floor. I was okay with this, since at such a high height, this would've been a cardio rep-fest for everyone. Straps were allowed, and I found that my regular straps were only barely long enough for me to wrap around the axle. Fortunately, we were allowed to strap in before the timer started- I easily spent 30+ seconds setting up my straps. Unfortunately, we had both up and down commands, so I effectively had to do dead stop deadlifts, which I never train. I was expecting to get 5-6 reps, and ended up getting 8. I did jump the up command on rep #3 and got a warning from the judge, so I had to slow down for the rest of them. I over-exaggerate the lockout on my deadlift, which I really need to stop doing as I'm sure it wastes a bunch of energy. Though this was a PR for me, the other competitors all got more reps than me, so I was sitting at last place overall.

**Event 3: ??? lb Conan Wheel**

[3/4 turn (3rd place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18OHz9J4aYZBTeRm0U81hiCnoZ_w1Sko0/view?usp=sharing)

I was really excited for this event, since I had never done it before. I don't know the weight, and I don't think the weight for this event is very meaningful since every Conan wheel setup has different geometry so you can't really compare them. But it was definitely sufficiently heavy. There was no time limit for the event, but no drops were allowed. Since the event was new to most of the competitors, we had quite a bit of time to practice ahead of time. This implement felt a lot better than the Zercher holds that I had done in prep- no losing feeling in my left forearm. I got a bunch of advice from fellow competitors on how to do it: try to look forward, and when you can't do that anymore, look up; keep moving; and ignore the voice in your head telling you to stop. I think I did a decent job doing all of that, though I would have liked to complete one whole revolution. This event just feels really heavy and draining. It didn't hurt during the event itself, but as soon as I dropped it, my vision started coning out, my hearing was muffled, and there was a ringing in my ears. I had to sit down for a while, but was fine after 5 minutes. It was taxing for sure, but I think a truck pull  is the best event for truly gassing you out. 

**Event 4: 600? lb Yoke + 230/hand Farmer's Medley**

[28.12 s (4th Place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K_d04ENZCTxfTsEDfEHI5_OL5dxmHF8o/view?usp=sharing)

This was a 50 foot medley. I'm not sure on the yoke weight, since the plan was for it to be 600, but I thought it felt lighter than that. We got to choose the order to do the medley in. I was more confident in the yoke, so I chose to do it first. I was a little out of practice on the yoke and I felt very slow, but I didn't have any drops. I messed up the pick on farmer's: you can see how the right handle was pointed slightly downwards, but the left handle was basically horizontal. This made me feel pretty unstable, but I managed to do the whole distance with no drops. My time was very close to the other competitors: only a 4.5 second spread in the top 4. I was only 0.14 seconds off of 3rd place. 

**Event 5: 237 lb Keg, \~210 lb Sandbag, \~200 lb Stone Carry and Load Medley**

[30.78 s (3rd Place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12DyEB5O2yslsd1bq3jkLddnxQZWcNX8g/view?usp=sharing)

I had done carries and loads separately before, but never together. It showed in my technique- I had to regrip every implement when I got to the yoke to throw it over. I nearly was able to do it in a single motion with the sandbag, but wasn't quite there. I also dropped the stone, which I'm pretty disappointed about- this stone is way lighter than my best, but I guess I was tired. I was only a little more than a second behind third place. I see a ton of room for improvement here. I really want to practice this the next time I have access to implements.

**Wrap-up**

I placed 4/5 in the middleweights, and managed to meet all my goals for the competition. I'm really held back by my overhead pressing strength, and will have that as my main focus in my training. My technique for loading and picking definitely needs some work, but that'll have to wait until I'm able to regularly train somewhere with implements. In the meantime, I'm planning on doing a slow bulk and work on building up my strength throughout the winter. I'm looking forward to competing again next year. Towards the end of the year, I want to do a mock meet to test maxes. I know a 500 lb squat and deadlift are very close, as is a bodyweight strict press.",2019-10-30 22:32:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/dpe3oj/competition_report_chicago_strength_strongman/

These are all pretty NSFW, but they're relatively tame by C&P standards I would say.

Jamie starts this series with the statement ""Hunger Burns the Fat Off Man's Soul"".  After completing a 4 week ""fast"" of almost nothing but protein shakes, at a daily caloric deficit of roughly 1500 calories, I certainly concur.  

 **MY BACKGROUND**

6'3"" 223 lbs (starting weight) 210 lbs (ending weight)

Age: 26 

Gender: Male

I rarely if ever test 1RM and I don't write stuff down anymore, but here's some numbers to give you an idea of where I was starting from:

Best Squat: 225x20, consistently hit sets of 14 during Deep Water Intermediate

Best Clean and Press: 195x1

Best Power Clean: 225x2 

I've been an athlete since I was a kid.  My first journey into lifting weights was with my best friend in Middle/High school who had a squat/bench rack in his basement since his dad was a bodybuilder.  So we would fuck around on there before starting training ""seriously"" for high school football, where I played offensive and defensive line.  I was much heavier in high school (also much stronger and in much worse shape), probably topping out around 290 my senior year.  Going into college I dropped 80 or so pounds and started playing rugby and getting much more into running.  I played every position in the pack except 8 and ran a couple of half marathons.  Then, senior year of college, I let my fitness go to shit and I got back up to my high school weight and probably more (was avoiding the scale at the worst of it).  After college, I got my shit back together (although I ran stronglifts for a while, only God can judge me), and now I am where I am and moving forward consistently.  I was getting back into rugby this fall, but due to hurting my foot, I had to stop after the third week.  So, I was looking for something challenging to do which brings us to FF&F.

 **BRIEF PROGRAM OVERVIEW** 

Part 1 of the Feast, Famine and Ferocity program, or ""The Famine"", as I've been calling it, is not so much a training protocol as it is an eating protocol, or rather a not eating protocol.  Anyone who is familiar with the velocity diet will probably recognize it.  It calls for 5-6 protein shakes spaced evenly throughout the day; enough so that you get 1g of protein per lb of bodyweight.  And that's it.  That's all you eat every day, for 2-4 weeks.  You train 4 days a week, 2 upper body and 2 lower body, with the workouts consisting of 1 or 2 heavy compound lifts followed by 2-3 more bodybuilding type lifts.  I actually found the training to be quite enjoyable, even in a the depleted state I was in.

The Famine is followed by The Feast, which is a 4 week period of very heavy/high volume training and overfeeding.  Which, I'm currently drooling over.  I'll do a write up on that once I'm finished with it.

 **MY CHANGES**

Since I definitely consider myself chubby/fat, I decided, per Jamie's request, to run this for 4 weeks.  I think my total calories per day came to 1350, which I estimate is about a 1500 calorie deficit for me.

Also, before we continue, I need to be honest that I did run this with a weekly cheat ""window"".  From 4pm until I went to bed (I go to bed around 9 or 10 pm) each Saturday all bets were off.  I drank beer, ate pizza and was a general glutton each week for this time window, then it was back to work Sunday morning.  Jamie does not make any mention of a cheat day in his blog post so I can safely say he does not condone this, but I did.  Whatever.  Still lost 14 lbs in 4 weeks.

As far as training is concerned, I followed the routine outlined in the blog post pretty much exactly as written, except I did do reverse hypers instead of leg curls a few times.  On the ""Dealer's Choice"" day, I typically did some sort of conditioning: 10x10 burpees, 30/30s (30second sprint, 30second rest) on the elliptical, or went for a run.  Sometimes I did some abs or rings as well.  One day I did some axel power cleans for some reason or another.  I went for a 2-4 mile run on every ""Rest/Cardio"" day.  I also went for a lot of walks.

I also took Jamie's advice on taking stimulants on this program and bought some Cannibal Inferno.  I can't say whether or not these were necessary, or if they really sped fat loss, but I certainly enjoyed them and it beats drinking pots of coffee to stay awake.

 **PERSONAL EXPERIENCE**

I put a lot of mental preparation into this program, and I think this was 95% of the reason I was able to succeed.  In the days leading up to it, I told myself that I needed to psychologically transform in order to complete this.  Willpower would not be enough.  The hunger was certainly real, but I think the mental difficulties were much greater but once overcome, the spiritual gainz were pretty crazy.  I won't go into detail on this in the write up, but I've been exploring the idea of God, praying, meditating, etc. quite a bit over the past year and a half and The Famine certainly sparked some wild ""feelings"" in this department.  

I drank a lot of tea and a couple cups of bouillon after work each day.

Training was difficult.  For the heavy sets, I picked weights that I was pretty sure I could do 2-4 reps really solidly and just always made sure to get 2-3.  Sometimes I felt like I could do more, and normally I wouldn't care so much about form, but I was so shakey most of the time that I almost always stopped at triples or doubles.  The 20 minutes of dips and pullups were both super fun.  For dips, I typically did sets of 12 with 40-50s rest and for pullups (all were pullups, no chin ups) I did sets of 4-6 with 50-60s rest.  Both of those made me sore AF.  I think my least favorite part was the 15 mins of bis/tris supersets.  I just dreaded them every week for some reason.  My weights did not increase or decrease, though the pullups and dips got easier.  I worked hard as shit during these workouts, I always felt like I was pushing up against some limit.  I listened to NIN's *The Downward Spiral* every single lifting and conditioning session.  I don't listen to music when I run.

I am not going to post pictures.  I got way skinnier, but I'm so depleted that it's hard to see any more ""shred"" than there was before (I'm also just kind of fat still), but I definitely didn't lose any muscle - in fact I may have gained a tiny bit, at least in my biceps.  

 **WOULD I RUN IT AGAIN**

100% yes, and I would probably cheat in a more restrained way.  I think I'm going to do another 2-4 week famine after this feast and then maybe run BtM after that, but that's a bit far out for me at the moment.

 **WHAT'S NEXT**

The Feast.

da9tk1,weightroom,"Meet Report: Top Lifter IV, Sydney, NSW, Australia (580 @ 103kg, 348.99 wilks, 497.90 IPF Points - 26 yrs old)","# Background 

I’m a mediocre powerlifter who’s been training for about four years now. I’ve run all kinds of flavours of linear progression, most recently Average to Savage 1.0 which I’ve been tweaking with some success. 

# Training

I ran a modified version of Average to Savage up to this meet. 


- Squat 2x a week, comp squat 1 day a week with linear progression, pause squats 1 day a week following the [Juggernaut Pause Squat Progression](https://www.jtsstrength.com/building-strength-out-of-the-hole/).
- Bench: 2x a week moving to 3x a week, each time following a model from Stronger By Science's bench programs.
- Deadlift 1x a week, doing the alternate Average to Savage deadlift progression which is like an Inverted Juggernaut density progression with lots of low rep sets in limited time. 
- Overhead Press linear progression, low volume.

I had a bunch of accessories for each upper and lower day. Usually 3-4 with 3 sets each.

I had some meniscus irritation that flared to rehab, so I had to drop my squat intensity for most of the prep. That didn't seem to affect my strength too much, luckily.

I was also dealing with some shoulder irritation, which ended up being a result of me not getting tight enough in my bench set up. 


# Diet

I ran at what I thought was a surplus building up to the comp, but I didn't end up gaining much weight through the 12 weeks. I sat right around 103kg for prep. I aimed for a protein goal each day and filled the rest in as needed.


# Meet Day

I was comfortably under 105kg, so I ate breakfast, had a coffee, and went to the venue. Quite a few of my mates showed up to come watch, which was really really sweet of them and definitely gave me impetus not to screw it up.

**Squats**
[190kg](https://youtu.be/HK0-1MaV5GE)
Crushed it.

[200kg](https://youtu.be/1RVjJCcciNU)
Smoked it again. My buddies were making a lot of noise which got me described as ""a crowd favourite.""

[210kg](https://youtu.be/gEZ6zq9_0gM)

Slower than I'd like, so i resisted the urge for 3 plates and jumped to 138kg.

[138kg](https://youtu.be/ArbbZ-0AuxM) - 
Miss. I had to rerack as one of my heels was off the ground, but I don’t think that made a difference as on the attempt, I dropped my chest on the pause and didn't have the juice to recover it.

**Deadlift**

[225kg](https://youtu.be/HDJ2p16KCBc)
Slow but fine.

[235kg](https://youtu.be/x_BUUY2-Z88) 
Took a while to move but once it did, it moved well. I decided to go with 240kg because what the hell.

[240kg](https://youtu.be/xqvFVt1TKvM) 
I got the most amped out of any lift of the day, gave it a good tug and moved it off the floor, but couldn't budge it past my ankles.

I ended up with silver in my weight class - the winner won by about 70kg, haha. I saw a 180kg bench press which was a very close miss, which was pretty awesome as well.


# Thoughts

I ended up with 497.90 IPF points which is just below average. 

I'm happy with how I performed on the day but not satisfied with my prep in the leadup. I would have expected more from a year of training.  

One of the reasons for that is I think my programming follows a very similar route, which is one I know and one I’m comfortable with. That didn't have the same results I wanted it to. I feel I'm about at that point where I need an external opinion in my training, so I've hired a coach to do my programming and critique my form. 

I also didn't put enough effort into my diet, taking a near enough is good enough approach. I could have done better, especially around protein intake consistency and overall calorie tracking. I'm back tracking my calories again, and will buy some more protein as soon as my life expenses calm down a bit.

civhd6,weightroom,[PROGRAM REVIEW] Ben Pollack's Free Intermediate Program (2 Cycles),"**HISTORY**

Starting lifting seriously around June of 2018, but have played sports competitively for my whole life. Played a year of college lacrosse as well, but stopped and have been doing nothing but lifting ever since. Ran nSuns until I hit the 1000 lbs club and after extensive research (not really), I decided to hop on /u/utben's [Free Intermediate Program](https://phdeadlift.teachable.com/p/free-intermediate-program) which I've now run twice. I'd link directly to the spreadsheet, but Ben wants you to sign up for his website to download, and it's free/full of great resources so check it out.

**STATS BEFORE**

|Sex/Age|Male/20|
|:-|:-|
|Weight|192|
|Sqaut|355|
|Bench|245|
|Deadlift|415|
|OHP|155|

**THE PROGRAM**

Without revealing too much, the program consists of 2 4-week cycles and 1 2-week phase, with volume gradually decreasing and intensity gradually increasing. Week 11 is spent testing new 1RMs, and Week 12 is a deload. Relatively standard linear periodization, but Ben structures it well. The weekly split is a four-day full-body routine, with two heavy days and two light days. The light days use close variations of the competition lifts. For example, Day 1 Week 1 looks as follows:

Squat: 3x12 @65%

Bench: 3x12 @65%

DB L-Fly: RPE@8,@9,@10 x12

Incline Shrugs: RPE@8,@9,@10 x12

Seems like low volume, which it definitely is, but it kicked my ass both times I ran it. This is likely due to my consistently poor conditioning.

**WHAT I CHANGED**

* Cycle 1: I did not change much in this cycle, other than occasionally straying from the prescribed assistance work due to whatever lame excuses I could find, like not wanting to wait for an open machine or not budgeting enough time before class.
   * I also switched out High Bar Squat for Low Bar Pause Squat, which I think reeeeeally helped my squat, and was fun! Weights for this were kind of all over the place, trying to hit about RPE of 8 most days. Did the same for cycle 2
* Cycle 2: I found that my bench did not increase as much as I would have liked after the first cycle, so I added a 5th day each week focused on Pause Benching about 75% of whatever I benched that week. In theory, this would help fix my shit bench. In theory.
   * I also developed a minor case of bicep tendonitis (undiagnosed, could have just been a strain) which resulted in me taking about 3 weeks off of Deadlift in the middle of cycle 2. Surprisingly, this did not have a significant negative impact on my results, and I am now (mostly) pain free.
* For many of the secondary variations of the main lifts, I upped the weight a whole lot each session. Many of the percentages felt very light, in particular for switch stance deadlift and close grip bench press, which I usually increased significantly. I still tracked whatever weight I did each week to make sure I was continuing to make progress on all of the lifts.

**DIET**

Nothing new or revolutionary here. Focused primarily on maintaining my weight in the 190-200 range. Calories were not counted, but protein intake was tracked (\~1g/lb). I also inconsistently took creatine, inconsistent because I'm dumb and would often just forget to put it in my coffee.

No other supplements were taken, with coffee and oatmeal serving as preworkout most of the time.

**RECOVERY**

Stretched infrequently, mostly whenever I started to feel like pain was on the horizon. I also started developing a lot of pain in my elbows during squats, which is probably due to not leaning forwards enough and resting the weight on my arms. To avoid this, I stretched my elbows between every set of squats, which seemed to help a lot. Hoping to avoid this issue in the future by fixing my squat form.

I took the prescribed deload after cycle 1. My training was also inconsistent in general due to life--who would have thought 20 weeks of life could have so many interruptions?

With the addition of a 5th Pause Bench day in Cycle 2, I changed the structure to be an 8 day cycle instead of the typical week length. I felt like this helped me avoid injury, but evidence here is purely anecdotal and based mostly off my thought that the week is an arbitrary length to structure a program around.

**STATS AT THE END**

**CONCLUDING THOUGHTS/WHAT'S NEXT**

I am very happy with how my squat and deadlift have progressed on this program. Hitting [405](https://imgur.com/a/bsfWJne) was probably the hardest I've ever had to grind for a lift--I came to a dead stop about halfway up. I forgot all of the cues I had been using: I threw my elbows back instead of keeping them underneath me, I didn't engage my glutes, etc. I forgot how to squat, but hey, I did it, so who cares? I'll do better next time

Deadlift was a big surprise given the time off I ended up taking. Hitting the arbitrary goal of 200kg feels great. I tried to pull 455 right after given how good it felt but couldn't even budge it off the floor. Oh well, on to 495.

Bench was incredibly frustrating, and I think I've figured out why it didn't go up as much as I would have liked:

1. I'm a bitch
2. I'm bad at bench
3. I didn't bench enough
4. I didn't eat enough
5. I'm a bitch

So given that, I've decided to hop on Deathbench next, and just work harder on it than I have been in the past. Pause Bench sets definitely helped me maintain tightness and improved my form, but it did not translate super well to strength gains unlike it did with Squats. Maybe the insane volume of Deathbench is what I need.

Overall, I would say that I recommend /u/utben's program, but really just for Squat and Deadlift. I responded very well to the amount of volume/progression schemes for both of these, and I'm going to run the program for these (with my modifications) again this next cycle. My complaints stem primarily from my own failings on Bench and from the light weight variants of the main lifts--they often just felt too easy.

In the next 10 weeks (after this deload) I'm going to get back to bulking (B U L K  T O  2 4 2) and try to avoid getting injured. I'm going to do more direct ab work as well--I bought an ab wheel to make abs more fun. Yay.

Oh, I also did OHP.",2019-07-28 12:53:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/civhd6/program_review_ben_pollacks_free_intermediate/
c1qrz8,weightroom,"[Meet Report] USAPL Seattle Summer Classic | M34, Raw | 540 @ 85.9 | 515.92 Points","TL;DR: First meet, weaker than expected, being greedy is dumb. 

**Background**

Been thinking about doing a meet for a while just for kicks. Found one close to me that kind of fit with my training schedule for the year, so decided now was as good a time as any and signed up. 

**Training**

To keep this section short, I'll just say I lost about 3 kg after I signed up for the meet and everything went to shit accordingly. It wasn't an intentional cut, I just chose the worst possible time to need a mental break from eating. Originally I was thinking 592.5 was reasonable, but I had to dramatically lower my expectations. 

**Meet Day**

Weighed in at 85.9, because weighing in closer to 93 is a crutch. I thought that the standard meet day nutrition of Pop Tarts and Gatorade would be enough to get me through the day, but I definitely should've eaten breakfast or something. We didn't end up finishing until after 2, and I was running on fumes by then. I never use preworkout or ammonia, so I just picked up some coffee on the way there and had my wife pick me up more when she came later in the morning. During the briefing they mentioned that all three judges were national level judges, which was a bit more than I was expecting for a small ~30 person local meet. I literally didn't practice commands at all during training, so that had me a little on edge. 

**Squat**

[Squat 1, 180, good lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_c7HmethKYum48dK9kd7BNdzLbg43CaS)

[Squat 2, 190, good lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MVEodPMGWukfZj2kaR9d2P3v-YQOC0bw)

[Squat 3, 195, good lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AkbTDUoEh6n7xid90TAyO6f1B1X9oz1t)

I am not a morning person, so I didn't have high hopes going into squats. Warm ups weren't feeling great, but it was within reason so I stuck with my planned opener. First attempt was pretty slow, but still within reason. Second attempt was really slow, and I knew that my planned third at 200 wasn't happening. Called for 195 instead, and that was the right call. I also haven't recorded my squat in a long time, so I had no idea that I was going that low. On the bright side, there isn't a judge in the world who would call me on depth, so I have that going for me which is nice. 

**Bench**

[Bench 1, 107.5, good lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nmdOjBFXb_0UIim_vLCFLA8wfIbxJ9eS)

[Bench 2, 115, good lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HlAn-0t3BwQJIWEE4gDHImM84_zR6xZ8)

[Bench 3, 120, good lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TFdsGoztObt3Lq_ldOpIB06jymiN0OgC)

Bench surprised me. During warm ups my right (bad) hip was starting to cramp up because of the wide benches, so I wasn't expecting much. First attempt was a little shaky at the bottom, but it still moved way faster than expected so I went up 7.5 instead of 5 for my second. Second attempt probably moved better than the first, but my lat was kind of cramping up afterwards so I decided to stick to a 5 jump on my third. Should've gone up 7.5 there too, because my third was still a smokeshow. Announcer made a comment about my third that didn't look like a third. Not sure why bench went so well, I can only assume that ER racks are magical. 

**Deadlift**

[Deadlift 1, 212.5, good lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D2XntWoTgkU9RQODQqsmKh2x6Y0dH-Yp)

[Deadlift 2, 225, good lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aaJXcHq4Gzv6Gl8T-kHf0hUntPKhTV2w)

[Deadlift 3, 242.5, no lift.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CyuBa9a23P6NPWFl0sLREIbsclwATvE7)

Deadlifts were a big area of concern. I've pulled exclusively on a whippy bar with straps for the last couple years, so having to switch from that to a stiff bar and hook grip in eight weeks was a bit of an issue. Also, I noticed earlier in the week when I was working up to openers that I was getting really light headed by the time I got to deadlifts. The same thing happened during warm ups, although Pop Tarts and Gatorade mitigated that a bit. Opener and second ended up moving smooth, and I actually wasn't light headed at all after my second. Original plan was to call for 237.5 on my third, called for 240 because 225 moved well, then got greedy and changed it to 242.5 because I wanted to send it and see whether I'm actually gauging my max correctly. As you can see, that was not the right call. 237.5 would have been enough for me to get third in my class, but hindsight is 20/20. Or if I had actually ever looked at the scoreboard during the meet, since the guy in third failed his last attempt. Lesson learned though, I'm fairly spot on for estimating what I have in me on squat/deadlift so I need to trust my gut and not be greedy.

**Thoughts and Plans**

Overall the meet was worth doing. It was nice to actually be around other like-minded lifters, rather than commercial gym goers. Got a feel for how the day goes and what things I need to take into consideration next time. Plan now is to get back on a slightly modified ATS 2.0 and see if I can't regain some of the ground I lost leading up to the meet, now that my bodyweight has stabilized.",2019-06-17 17:57:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/c1qrz8/meet_report_usapl_seattle_summer_classic_m34_raw/
bjyz6a,weightroom,[Program Review] 531 + Custom Accessories,"**Background:**

M16 (5ft11), been lifting for 1.5 years and only got really into strength training at the end of 2018. Started off doing bro splits for a few months before moving on to PPL which I ran for a bit before switching to PHUL after which I followed a few strength programs I found online. Now I wanted to experiment with programming for myself so did some research and decided 5/3/1 would be a solid starting point as it is more of a philosophy rather than a rigid program, so I began to run it in January 2019. There was a slight issue as I had to have surgery soon so ended up missing 2 weeks of training while I was recovering and lost a fair chunk of strength during that period as I was completely sedentary. My main goal, therefore, was to get a good feel for programming for myself, seeing what works and what doesn't and hopefully make some solid progress especially in my OHP which had been really hard to progress.

&#x200B;

**Stats before starting:**

&#x200B;

BW : 68kg (151lb)

Squat 1RPM: 115kg

Bench Press 1RPM: 75kg

Deadlift 1RPM: 140kg

OHP 1RPM: 50kg

&#x200B;

**The Routine:**

&#x200B;

For accessory work, I decided to test my own programming skills as I had been reading quite a bit on effective programming for strength training, therefore, my accessory work was all custom.

&#x200B;

Day 1 (Tuesday)

Squat 5/3/1  + 1 or 2 Joker Sets on most days unless I wasn't feeling it in which I would just repeat sets 1 and 2

Paused Deadlift 4 x 5 \~ 65% of 1RPM

Leg Press -  3 x 8-12

&#x200B;

Day 2 (Wednesday)

Bench Press 5/3/1 + 1 or 2 Joker Sets on most days unless I wasn't feeling it in which I would just repeat sets 1 and 2

Pull-Ups  4 x 6-8

Pin Press (Forehead Height) 4 x 4-6Some Tricep Work

&#x200B;

Day 3 (Saturday)

Deadlift 5/3/1 + 1 or 2 Joker Sets on most days unless I wasn't feeling it in which I would just repeat sets 1 and 2

Paused Squats 3 x 5 \~ 65% of 1RPM

Barbell Rows 3 x 6-8

&#x200B;

Day 4 (Sunday)

OHP 5/3/1 + 2 or 3 Joker Sets on most days unless I wasn't feeling it in which I would just repeat sets 1 and 2

Incline Bench Press 4 x 6-8

Face Pulls 4 x 8-12

Some Bicep Work

&#x200B;

Conditioning: Ran about 20km a week although this dropped later on into the program. Usually ran on off days and after gym sessions to minimize its impact on my lifting as running wasn't my main priority during this period of time.

&#x200B;

**Reasoning behind choices:**

&#x200B;

Paused Deadlifts -  I had found that I had no issue locking out weight but would struggle with getting the weight off the ground so paused deadlifts seem to be a perfect choice.

Paused Squats - My main problem in the squat was getting out of the hole and I didn't particularly enjoy pinned squats I went with paused squats instead.

Leg Press - Since I was low bar squatting for most of this program went with the leg press to ensure my quads didn't feel like they were having it easy.

Pull Ups - I really enjoy doing pull-ups/ chin-ups so when it came to choosing a verticle pulling motion it was a pretty straight forward decision.

Pin Press (forehead height): I chose this in order to get some extra OHP volume and the forehead height because most of my issues would be once the weight was already over my head.

Incline Bench Press: Chose this exercise as my secondary bench movement mainly because it is just a harder variation of the bench press and I enjoyed doing it but in hindsight perhaps paused bench would have been more effective at actually improving my bench press.

Face Pulls: Mainly just included for shoulder health and to balance out all that pushing.

&#x200B;

**Diet and Sleep:**

Was in a caloric surplus for the duration of the program but didn't track calories so don't have an exact figure but here's what a typical day of eating would look like.

Breakfast: Wholegrain wheat cereal (Weetabix) + 1 cup of coffee

Lunch: Usually a chicken wrap/panini 

Snack: A couple of peanut butter sandwiches

Dinner: some protein-rich dish

This would usually be supplemented with a protein shake which was taken every day and creatine which was also taken daily.

&#x200B;

Sleep was a fairly consistent 8 or so hours with the odd day where I would sleep a little less but it would average out in the long run. Previously I didn't prioritise sleep much however after listening to Mathew Walker on JRE starting taking sleep more seriously which has helped a lot with specifically having more consistent energy levels throughout the day amongst other benefits.

&#x200B;

**Side Point :**

After I had finished my 3 cycles of 531 I ran a short peaking program (\~3 weeks) in order to be ready to test my 1RPM where I just did a bunch of singles, doubles and triples in order to be sure I would be fully prepared.

&#x200B;

**Results :**

BW 71.6kg (157lb)

Squat 115kg -> 130kg

Bench Press 75kg -> 80kg

Deadlift 140kg -> 150kg

OHP 50kg -> 57.5kg

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts:**

&#x200B;

Overall fairly happy with my results given my set of circumstances although there are some areas of improvement that I have noticed.

* Should have deloaded for a whole week, instead of taking a few days, just before I tested my 1RPM as I did come in slightly fatigued which may have led to impaired performance.
* My peaking program was fairly short so I felt as though I still could have improved a bit more which may explain why my e1RPMs are mostly higher than my tested 1RPMs. (Squat 135kg, Bench Press 82kg, Deadlift 160kg, OHP 57kg)
* Should have switched incline bench with paused bench as it has more of a carry over towards the bench press

I am a little gutted I didn't manage to overhead press a plate this time around however that gives me something to work towards. In the future, I may run a program where I empathise my bench a little more since I  didn't make as much progress in that respect as I would have liked. All in all, I did get a better understanding of programming for myself (Still have a lot to learn though) and also managed to make some solid progress on my OHP.",2019-05-02 19:23:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/bjyz6a/program_review_531_custom_accessories/
bj469t,weightroom,[Meet Report] [+ /u/gzcl Coaching Review] USAPL District Open - Washington D.C. (495 @ 86.3 | 323 Wilks),"**Background and Training**

I wrestled and did some lifting in high school, and ran some variant of SS/SL on-and-off during college. Starting in January of 2017 I started lifting more consistently--you can view [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/9o4qyd/meet_report_father_vs_son_pushpull_raw/) to get an overview of the programs I ran from then until November of 2018. 

In November, my dad and I did an unofficial push-pull contest (see the post above) where I got a 255 (unpaused) bench and 400 DL (both lbs). The week after I also tested my squat, getting a [grindy 345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLrRPVNbb6c&feature=youtu.be). At this point, I wanted to take my training more seriously, and decided to start working with an online coach. /u/gzcl (Cody Lefever) had (and still has) a great reputation for all of his free programming and general lifting information he's put out, and I learned that he offered online coaching, so I reached out to him.

Cody and I worked together for the past 6 months. He did all of my programming, which usually consisted of him sending me a general plan for 4-5 week training blocks, and then doing minor updating of weights/reps/sets on a weekly basis. I would check in with him once a week, sending him videos of sets, and just giving him detailed information on how each training session went. He would respond within 24-48 hours (usually within 24) addressing all of my questions and giving me form feedback. 

The programming was pretty much a personalized version of the General Gainz program, which Cody laid out [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/). The main concept of this style of programming is that T1 work is done by hitting a main RM set in 3-5 rep range, and then following that up by high quality singles. The T2 work is done using a RM set in the 6-10 rep range, followed-up by half-sets. Please read the post for a much more detailed explanation!

Looking back on the training, I remember being a little
surprised/skeptical when we first started and I got the programming
with all of the singles. I thought that we were going to start with
crazy high volume stuff, but I knew that the key to working with a
coach is to “trust the process”. It took a little bit for the
programming to click, but once it did, it made so much sense,
especially since Cody knew my goal was to get stronger and **better** at the main lifts for a competition. Cody provided great cues for improving movements, such as how to stay tight on the squat and bench. We focused a lot on controlling bar speed, and using this as a parameter to play around with, which I had never done before. Overall this style of training lead to great strength increases (you'll see later), and I would highly recommend it.

Cody also had me hammering a lot more back work than I had ever done (usually two T2 lifts a week were back work, with some T3 back work as well), which I also really credit to helping my deadlift improve. In terms of the T1 work, we started with a typical 4 day a week split, doing Squat, Bench, DL, OHP, and then eventually we removed OHP, replacing that day with lighter squat and bench work. We eventually also increased the DL volume, doing 1 heavy day, and 1 lighter day with paused work. I could go on-and-on about the training, but I figure I (and Cody, and anyone else that's been using GG) can just answer more questions in the comments about this style of training. 

My diet was nothing special. Breakfast consisted of 3-4 eggs, toast, and avocado, and lunch and dinner was usually .5-1 lb (before cooking) of protein, a serving of rice, and some roasted vegetables.

**Meet prep**

I weighed 86 KG (189 lbs-- I gained about 4-6 pounds over the 6 months working with Cody), and decided to not cut for 83 KG since it was my first meet, and I'm still scarred from cutting weight for wrestling in high school. This put me in the 93 KG weight class, meaning I was eating my normal diet throughout the week. Sleep was great (I'm a PhD student, which means I have a lot of freedom with my sleep schedule, and schedule in general). 

I did two really light training sessions on Monday and Wednesday of the meet week, where I just worked up to ~60% of my 1RM, and hit 3-4 singles on each of my lifts, practicing the commands.

The night before I went to sleep at 10:45, and
set my alarm for 5:45—figured 7 hours of sleep would be good enough. Woke up before my alarm went off, and I felt super great and
my heart was already pounding. Looked at the clock, and it was only 1
AM! So I pretty much spent the next 4.5 hours getting on-and-off
sleep, but I would say the overall sleep quality was pretty shit.
Stuffed down a cliff protein bar, had some coffee, then went to the
meet. Super glad I didn’t have to cut weight, so I could start
hydrating immediately after waking up

**The Lifts**

I went 9/9, here's the video of my highest attempts for each lift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JALiLQBGBas

Squat


157.5 KG, make: after weigh-ins, I was too nervous to eat much (and honestly felt like
this most of the day—I know there wasn’t a need to be nervous, but I
think that after putting all this time into training, I was putting
pressure on myself to perform). Calmed down a little bit after warming
up, and then the first attempt at 157.5 just flew up. After this, I knew it'd be a good day

165 KG, make: Another easy attempt

170 KG, make: This would be a 20 lb PR for me, and it felt super easy. I think all of those singles from GG had
engrained that movement pattern so well, that my lack of sleep and
food didn’t affect it (this goes for all the lifts). 

Bench

107.5 KG: Make

112.5 KG: Make

117.5 KG: Make

Not too much to say here--all of these attempts felt super easy, even though my bench had definitely been progressing the slowest during our programming, since I had never done any paused work before. Cody and I agreed that I left some pounds on the platform here, but this is less important than just getting the confidence from hitting my lifts in my first competition. Looking forward to continuing to improve my bench

Deadlift

190 KG: Make

200 KG: Make

207.5 KG: Make

Was quite nervous for the DL portion, since I knew these would be the
most challenging weights for me, and especially since my girlfriend
and a few other friends came in to watch these attempts. Was also a
bit shaky from not eating much throughout the day, but I think my
adrenaline carried me through here. Hit a fast 405 lb single in
warm-ups (like 10-15 minutes before the opener), and this gave me a
lot of confidence. First two attempts went great, and the last one at
459 lbs was definitely heavy, but the lift went really smooth, and it
wasn’t too “grindy”.

**Results**

Added ~60 lbs to my deadlift, ~30 to my squat, and 4 to my bench in 6 months. However, these final lifts all had great bar speed, and the competition bench was actually paused. 

**Final thoughts**

I loved working with Cody, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I also had a great first meet experience (other than the nerves). Everyone was so supportive, I loved the atmosphere, and the event even had great t-shirts, in addition to being run incredibly smoothly. 

My plans for the next 3-6 months are to definitely lose 15 pounds or
so (I'm only 5'7"", which feels a bit short for weighing 189), while also adding some general
cardiovascular work into my training. I’m definitely going to continue
GG style training with at least my T1 work, since I think it felt most
beneficial to me in the 3-5 rep range with those follow-up singles,
when the focus is on high quality lifting with heavy weights, and not
so much volume. Probably going to do more hypertrophy
focused type training, with some new T1 lifts, like
overhead press, high bar/front squats, and trap bar DLs, focusing on a
lot of shoulder and back for T2 work, and throwing in a lot more bicep
and rear/side delt work for my T3s.",2019-04-30 14:48:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/bj469t/meet_report_ugzcl_coaching_review_usapl_district/
bcuelq,weightroom,[Program Review] Inverted Juggernaut & 531 (& misc. accessories),"TL;DR ran Juggernaut & 531 together for 23 weeks, got bigger, got stronger, still sorta have vague abs. Wrote this as I do all my best writing - while eating and/or on the shitter. Feel free to ask me anything or point out any errors/omissions.

**Introduction, Goal, and Start/End Stats**

Since some of you probably care about the results just as much as (if not more than) the process itself, I’ll lead off with my starting and ending stats. I’m not using a Reddit table because they suck on mobile. Some of the starting numbers may look funny because I tested them coming off of UHF, at the end of which I did two singles and then an AMRAP with the same weight.

Notation is start -> finish

-	**Sex**: male -> male. Really pleased with this one.
-	**Height**: 5’7”-> 5’7”  :/
-	**Weight**: 164 -> 174ish
-	**Squat**: 270x2x1 then x3 (high bar) -> 295x5x3 (high bar) and 317.5x5 (low bar)
-	**Bench**: 230x2x1 paused then 230x3 TnG -> 237.5x5 TnG
-	**Deadlift** (conventional): 335x2x1 then x2 -> 365x5 (also 335x8 on two occasions)
-	**Press**: undetermined but probably around a plate -> 127.5x8 and 142.5x3

Other notable lifts are a clean bench 255 paused single @RPE 8 as well as a 245 paused double and 240 paused on a regular basis, a Slingshot 255x2 paused and 275 paused, a 4 plate sumo from never having pulled sumo, an ugly and regrettable 327.5x1 high bar squat @RPE “why” after deadlifting, low bar 325 @RPE 8ish after the final deadlift AMRAP, and a 155x1.5 press (i.e. press-then-push-press). Many of these were during the deloads to keep myself acclimated to some sort of intensity while dialing back volume.

Now onto the obligatory boring stuff about me. I’ve lifted consistently for about two years, with the last year or so being a bit more focused and thought-out. Started with nsuns and didn’t get the idea of eating and sandbagging a TM, did J&T2.0 for a bit, cut excessively on The Rippler, and then worked my way back up with some more J&T2.0 and UHF 5wk for a block. My goal with Inverted Juggernaut & 531 was to get stronger and more proficient at the main three powerlifting lifts and to a lesser extent the press, as well as to get bigger in general. Base-building, I suppose.


**The Program**

I ran Inverted Juggernaut and 531 concurrently for opposing lifts (e.g. Jugg squat, 531 deadlift) as a 4x per week U/L split. This lasted for 23 weeks as I drew out the first half of Juggernaut.

Inverted Juggernaut is Juggernaut - but inverted. Huh. The gist is that within a four-week wave you increase weight and lower volume, leading up to an AMRAP on week 3 for determining your TM next block followed by a deload week. There are four of these waves, named after the sets for the original Juggernaut: 10’s, 8’s, 5’s, and 3’s. You can see the layout [here](https://i.imgur.com/8k0Wnyt.jpg). In the Inverted scheme, the first two waves’ set/rep schemes are switched (e.g. 10x5 rather than 5x10, with rest times shortened to compensate). I did the 10’s and 8’s waves twice each (10, 8, 10, 8) before moving to the 5’s and 3’s. This was a spurious decision and in retrospect I would’ve done 10, 10, 8, 8 or instead hung out in the 5’s wave more. 

As for the 531 portion, I ran vanilla 531 as a pyramid, with the top and FSL sets each being PR sets. This is also a three-week deal, with a fourth week deload (though Jim has other recommendations in the form of the 7th week protocol or anchor/leader blocks now). I did these before the Juggernaut work until I hit the 5’s wave. Upon reaching the 5’s wave I lowered my TMs, switched to just doing 5’s Pro (take all the usual 531 sets... now make them flat 5’s) with 3x5 FSL, and did them after the Juggernaut work. I think this was The Move™, but more on this later.

As for accessories, I’d usually do a “main” compound supplementary to whatever I did first in the workout (e.g. snatch RDLs if I did deadlifts first) for something like 4-5 sets of 6-12 reps. Nothing fancy, either upping volume at a flat weight or upping weight and reducing volume across a wave. On this subject, snatch RDLs and belt squats are both very effective exercises of this nature since they’re inherently submaximal. Beyond that, I’d do a couple isolation exercises, 3-4 sets of 10-20 reps. Sometimes I’d instead set a total number of reps (mainly for chin-ups or dips) and just hit that throughout the workout. In the earlier waves, I’d superset pulls with my main work on upper body days (bench & row, press & vertical pull). I mostly stopped doing this later on but I’m still a big fan of chin-ups/pull-ups between sets of press (weighted or unweighted, depending on what I’m pressing). I don’t care as much about the press - at 5’7” and 174ish I’m the anti-Strongman, I guess - so this was a good way to rack up some volume even if it could’ve been at the slight expense of some press work.

Some sample days from my notebook.

**Diet & Recovery**

I’m a college student with a stable relationship and little social life, so my life is usually pretty calm until it isn’t. Usually nailed about 7 hours of sleep a night. To the best of my knowledge I was always in a caloric surplus (and given my weight, that’s consistent with basic thermodynamics). I’m on a college meal plan, so my diet revolves around whatever I can get. Consistent staples include skim milk, chicken breasts, rice, bananas, juice, etc. along with whatever looks appetizing on a particular day. Calorie-wise this was usually around 3400-3600 kcal throughout the program, with about 200g of protein, 100g of fat, and the rest from carbs. I’m a simple man.  I got more of my calories from dairy and snack foods than I would have liked, but I try to eat “cleaner” foods (whole grains, beans, etc.) when I get the chance.

I also like to eat out when it’s not on my dime (as you may have seen recently with my birthday) and/or prepare food with my girlfriend: [here](https://i.imgur.com/9KM2LQ0.jpg) [are](https://i.imgur.com/w20CrnZ.jpg) [some](https://i.imgur.com/Pf5g21m.jpg) [recent](https://i.imgur.com/LIfopAY.jpg) [morsels](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv9_zwtg0vm/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1i2kt17znymz1). You can probably tell I love salmon.

Supplement-wise, I take fish oil and a multi along with Vitamin C and some “joint health” thing that probably isn’t physiologically-active at this dose in order to appease my worrying parents, who think cracking your knuckles causes them to swell and become arthritic. I also take melatonin on the nights before I lift as I have to go to bed kinda early (9:30 or so). I’m also on creatine, natties beware.


**Conditioning**

I uhhh... walk a lot? Usually >100,000 steps a week, since I’m at school with no car. The restricted rest times on Inverted Juggernaut and my love for supersetting stuff is also its own form of conditioning. I’d sometimes do some carries every now and again, but these were usually limited to the deload weeks when I wanted to keep doing *something*. 


**What I Liked**

Both Inverted Juggernaut and 531 are dope. Sub-maximal volume is **nice**. High volume work seems to get shit on a lot but it’s my jam. I love the feeling of doing a lot of work without actually being beaten to shit. It was also a good opportunity to dial in form (though I could’ve done a better job of that in some respects; see below). Picking and rotating T2/T3 exercises at my own discretion and supersetting them and all that is fun and keeps things fresh. 


**What I Didn’t Like, Changes, and Reflections**

Preface: This section is long but I liked the program. These are just reflections on what I did and what I changed. 

I’m not exactly the biggest or strongest dude - I don’t think the whole “deload every fourth week” thing is ideal for my size and experience level. I wisened up to this a bit and usually took the deload weeks as an opportunity to hit a heavy single or two instead of doing the prescribed 3x3@60% or whatever. 

I also had a wave somewhere in there where I went up to 5x a week in order to try out sumo deadlifts, done a la Hepburn’s A (80%ish 8x2-3) and B (65%ish 3x6-8) workouts. This was fun but affected my squatting in a way that psyched me out and bothered my knee and positioning for a bit. I like 5x a week and it’s more than doable but not so much so when a day is shoehorned in. The good news of this is that, being needlessly stressed out about my squat, I really cleaned up my technique going into the 5’s wave and even moreso going into the 3’s. Turns out my squat wasn’t bad, necessarily - I was just bad at focusing, bracing, and dialing my shit in. You can see how my squat improved form-wise just in comparing this early [240x7](https://instagram.com/p/Bp93OqigTQl/)
 to [my beltless (🅱️oneless) deload squats](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvJkMMOACs-/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=85j1821df7mo)
 before the 3’s wave or some of the [531 work after deads](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvl7y51AWfk/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1pg2stc4qdde4)
, both from later in the program. I also learned low-bar at the last second (literally the [last lower session](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv34YrkAiai/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=ngt5ljlag075)
 before my [last squat AMRAP](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv_nsgngINm/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=w8yll2p1mvld)) and ultimately did my final AMRAP with it because it feels better. We can only speculate how my squat would be now had I learned this mystic technique - or just cleaned up my high bar - in the earlier waves of the program as intended.

As I mentioned before, I ended up switching to a more conservative 531 scheme and put this after the Inverted Juggernaut sets. What I found was that I’d put too much emphasis on hitting PRs - and often grinding or near-failing - on all the 531 work at the expense of good technique and getting the Juggernaut work in (though I never missed a set). That’s not to say it’s bad to push yourself and occasionally have to grind through something: things like AMRAPS are there for you to shut up and work. Consistent effort is great. However, in these circumstances volume and effort was more than sufficient without the PR sets, and I think I benefitted from those changes in the latter stages of the program.

**Final Thoughts & Future Plans**

My “didn’t like & changes” section was disproportionately long so let me again reiterate: **I really enjoyed this program and ultimately benefitted from it in a number of ways**. I got stronger, I got bigger, I got more proficient, and I had fun. It was a strong net positive. Going forward, I’m going to do a 4 week run through some of Nuckol’s free programs (3x Int Med bench, 3x IntAdv squat, 2x Int deadlift) and then hop into the program party fashionably late. I think if I hammer away at low bar squats I can hit 4 plates this year and hopefully get close to a 1200ish PL total before I graduate around this time next year.

Some cool ideas: Inverted Juggernaut with J&T2.0 accessories, Inverted Juggernaut for the main lifts with the first two waves of regular Juggernaut for a lighter assistance variant (e.g. close-grip bench or front squats), draw out or repeat the first two waves and/or remove the first deload, run the first three waves with an “overwarm” single as a kind of long-term offseason program like 531 but with a cooler name, etc.

Thank you to /u/CoffeePWO for the initial spreadsheet and idea for running Inverted Juggernaut & 531 together, everyone who told me I was overthinking things (I was), /u/BenchPauper for teaching me about Excel, the mods for tolerating my Daily Thread spamming, and viewers like you. Thank you.

akyiy9,weightroom,"[Meet Report] USAPL Spartan Open 01/26/2019 | San Jose, CA | 21M | 510 KG @ 71.3 KG | 376.91 Wilks | 552.75 IPF points (First Meet)","**Prior History & Motivation**


I’ve been lifting just over four years now, focusing on more powerlifting specific training in the last two (NSUNS and CAP3). I’m a senior in college, and our school just started a powerlifting club. I was always intimidated by the idea of lifting in a competition, but I jumped on the minute I heard I could go with a group of friends. My main goals were to total over 1100 lbs and to hit a 370 Wilks. I also wanted to beat my deadlift PR of 500 lbs.


**Prep**


*Program*


Prior to peaking, my top lifts were a 325x5 squat, an unpaused 235x3 bench, and a 500x1 lb deadlift. I was looking at a few different peaking programs I saw that /u/magistertempli had a meet on the same day and was planning on running GZCL’s UHF+ 5 week program. I decided to do the same because a program party seemed fun. Having never peaked before, I can’t comment on its efficiency, but I can say that I enjoyed the combination of heavy singles followed by high volume accessories. The program concluded 1 week out, though I went off program towards the end so I could test heavy singles on one day at a local powerlifting gym (Boss Barbell). I ended up filling the week before the meet with some light volume work and then took 3 days completely off.


*Bench Prep*


The powerlifting pause threw me a lot during training so I decided to open light just to be safe. Though I hit 235 lbs for some singles, I opted for a 100kg/220 lb opener.


*Squat Prep*


I squat high-bar and briefly considered learning to low-bar squat for the meet, but decided to save it for the future. Luckily thanks to this I had no problems hitting depth. I hit 345 lbs for an easy single one week out but decided to open lighter anyway with 147.5kg/325 lbs.


*Deadlift Prep*


Deadlift is my favorite and has always been my best lift. It was the only lift I’d truly maxed out before so I had pretty good expectations of what I could hit. Prior to peaking I’d always trained DL in socks without shoes and with mixed grip. Since I had to wear “shoes” during the meet I ended up buying some deadlift slippers online – I had some troubles with shipping and got them last minute but found they felt almost the same as socks and had no troubles adjusting. I also decided to switch to hook grip for the meet; I don’t know exactly why I chose to do it now, but it has always been a goal of mine and the heavy singles in UHF+ seemed like a good way to get used to it. My last single with hook grip felt solid at 480 lbs, but I decided to open with 210kg/462lbs because I find heavy deadlifts taxing and wanted to make bigger jumps and set a PR.


*Caffeine & Cutting*


As a caffeine addict, I decided to cut out caffeine (mostly coffee) four weeks out in order to drop my tolerance so it would be more effective on meet day. This was a massive headache for the first week, but lost most of the cravings after that.


At different points during the peaking program my weight fluctuated between 159 and 166 lbs. I wanted to make the 163 lb class, so I did a very light “water cut” during my rest week. I essentially just cut down on sodium while drinking over a gallon of water a day. The night before the meet I weighed 160 lbs and almost fully stopped drinking water or eating at 6pm.


**Night Before & Weigh In**


I had an awful time sleeping the night before the meet. I’m a night person by default and didn’t plan ahead by adjusting my sleep schedule. I went to sleep at 9:30pm and rolled around in bed until midnight. I woke up around 4:00am and found myself so anxious that I couldn’t sleep. I got to the meet location just after 7am and weighed in at 71.3kg/157 lbs which was quite a bit below the cutoff for my class. I didn’t feel particularly weak, but I felt incredibly sleepy. After drinking some coffee I felt better, probably thanks to the long break from caffeine. I also pounded multiple sandwiches and a bottle of Gatorade.


**Squats**


*Attempt 1*:  [Video 147.5kg / 325 lbs (3 whites)](https://youtu.be/dF0w3Lvhz_w)


I went into my first squat attempt a bit nervous because I was worried the lack of sleep would affect me, but I hit it easily. I jumped the gun and racked the weight just as I was given the “rack” command, but the judges were lenient and gave me three whites.


*Attempt 2*: [Video 160 kg / 352 lbs (3 whites)](https://youtu.be/xv_i9u1-YYQ)


Nothing much to say about this attempt, I hit depth easily and got three whites. I was thinking about jumping all the way to 370 lbs, but ended up being conservative with my third attempt.


*Attempt 3*: [165 kg / 363 lbs (3 whites)](https://youtu.be/DYE4n04QCAQ)


I was planning on using ammonia for this attempt, but opted not to because I felt energized and didn’t want to miss the rack command. I again hit depth easily, but this time had a bit of a grind on the way up. I still think I had another 10-15 lbs in me though.


**Bench**


*Attempt 1*:  No video 100kg / 220lbs lbs (2 whites, 1 red )


For some reason, instead of lowering the bar all the way to my chest, I held it just above my chest and waited for the command for what seemed like an eternity. When I realized what happened I dropped the bar a bit, got the “press” command immediately and then moved the weight. I was told that one judge thought the bar went up and then down so he gave me a red which I totally deserved. I forgot to arrange for a friend to record this attempt so I didn’t get a video, but I’m pretty sure the pause ended up being over 3 seconds making it way harder than it should have been.


*Attempt 2*: [Video 105 kg / 231 lbs (3 whites)](https://youtu.be/Hrm-I3fCNlE)


I was more controlled with my pause this time and hit the command spot on. The rep was a bit grindy so I opted to only go up 5 more kg.


*Attempt 3*: [Video 110 kg / 242 lbs (3 whites)](https://youtu.be/iGWxaRryBOY)


I was again tempted to break out the ammonia, but also skipped this time because I was afraid of missing a command. Once again the rep was grindy and I think I made the right call to not go up by more. My gym performance had me excited for a 250 lbs bench PR so I was a bit disappointed I didn’t get that.


**Deadlifts**


*Attempt 1*:  [Video 210 kg / 462 lbs lbs (3 whites)](https://youtu.be/1IKO6iHtDcU)


Not much to say, this rep was incredible easy and flew of the ground. I made a massive jump to just over my gym PR.


*Attempt 2*:  [Video 227.5kg / 501 lbs lbs (3 reds)](https://youtu.be/e5mD-9DuOwo)


This was my first lift of the day with ammonia and I also had a friend slap me hard on my back. In my attempt to “pull the slack out of the bar”, I actually ended up lifting the weight about an inch, putting it back down and then pulling it for a full rep. I was obviously red lighted and now had an incredibly hard decision to make: was I to try the same weight again and not hit a big PR? Or was I to make a jump and risk a massive loss to my total and a DL well below my capabilities. I ended up taking the risk and jumping to 235 kg. Had I not failed the 2nd attempt I would have likely gone 2.5kg higher.


*Attempt 3*:  [Video 235kg / 518 lbs lbs (3 whites)](https://youtu.be/LESkC7MDLJA)


I was incredibly scared as I walked up to the platform for the reasons I’d written above – again I used ammonia. As I lifted the weight up, there was a bit of grind but I knew that it was going to rise and managed to lock it out. Once I got three whites I was incredibly happy. This was without a doubt my hardest lift of the day. I may have been able to make the 237.5kg attempt but I’m glad I didn’t take the risk.


**Results**


I totaled 510 kg/ 1124 lbs at 71.3 kg/ 157 lbs giving me a 376.91 Wilks score beating both of my personal goals. I got “first” in my division (74kg-Jr) but learned later I was the only person in it. There were five people set to compete in my division but they ended up not showing up or competing in a higher weight class. I did score 10th out of 29 according to the new IPF points system which I don’t fully understand. Also, everyone from my university club got 1st or 2nd in their divisions which was nice.


**What I learned**


My main takeaway from my first meet was to focus on adjusting my sleep schedule ahead of time. There were a lot of things that went my way but sleep deprivation going into the meet was the biggest variable working against me, and I could have prevented it by planning the week before. I’d also never cut weight before and lost more than I anticipated (6 lbs below my class) so I’m happy to have learned how my body reacts to short term water loss.


**Thoughts**


Overall I’m quite proud of myself and my results. I definitely plan to compete again and honestly wish I had competed earlier at a time where I wasn’t as stressed about hitting certain numbers and just focused on the experience. My current plan is to slowly bulk into the next weight class (182.75lbs) and build strength, especially in my bench press. I also want to eventually switch to a low bar squat as that should help with my total. I start GZCL’s Jacked & Tan 2.0 later this week.

abvrgc,weightroom,[Program Review] Texas Method,"Hey /r/weightroom! It's the start of a new year and I also think it's time I put this program to the side and continue my strength journey with another program. I've never given a program review before so bare with me if some formatting is off. I'll try to keep this review orderly and easy to understand.

**First, about me:**

I never touched a barbell in my life until September 2017. I started college and I decided I wanted to be strong. I never did any sports prior to this and my only real ""activity"" is I worked on a farm for most of my life. I decided to do Texas Method because I liked the name, no other reason. The first day I was in the gym I just put a 45 pounder on each side of the barbel for my bench, squat, and deadlift and went from there.

**Starting Stats:**

Keep in mind some of these weren't true maxes because I had no idea where to start. All of the weight I use will be in pounds, my height is in inches.

Squat: 225x10

Deadlift: 225x10

Bench: 135x10

Strict Press: 95x5

Chin-Ups: 10 @ bodyweight

Bodyweight: 160lbs

Height: 5'9

Age: 19

**The Program:**

I picked Texas Method because it had a cool name. I read it was for ""intermediates"" but I figured any program would work for me if I just lifted heavier and heavier weights. The program had me lifting 3x a week as per here: https://www.t-nation.com/training/texas-method. I also joined a BJJ club at the same time I started lifting and have done that 2x a week since then. 

The only modification I made to the program was I replaced the power cleans/power snatch with rows. (Barbell, cable, and dumbbell) 

**The Diet:**

I was pretty small, but kinda chubby. I guess some people call it skinny fat. I never cared about my physique, I just wanted to be strong. I estimated my TDEE at 2300 calories and I used myfitnesspal to track my daily calories. I ate at a 500 surplus for a few months, then eventually stopped counting calories and just listened to my body for when it needed more or less food. I made sure to get 150g of protein every day and didn't focus on my carb/fat intake.

Some staples of my diet were/are milk, chicken, beef, pork, eggs, pasta, rice, and oats. I love frozen blueberries and would eat them before my workout as well as a cup of coffee.

**Results:**

I took the last 2 weeks to test my maxes, a true 1RM of various things (not just what I trained.) It was cool to see that even stuff I didn't train (front squat) was a decent weight. All of these stats were recorded December 17th-December 29th.

Back Squat: 410lbs

Front Squat: 275lbs

Deadlift: 465lbs

Bench Press: 300lbs

Strict Press: 175lbs

Weighted Dip: +45lbs for 10 reps

Weighted Pull-Up: +45lbs for 6 reps

Bodyweight: 190lbs

Height: 5'9

Age: 21

**Thoughts:**

I'm so happy I stepped into that gym. In my opinion, any program would've worked for me. I don't think I'm advanced enough to be giving recommendations to beginners, but I'd say Texas Method is a good program to run for anyone who is new to lifting. Is it necessary? No. Is it the best? I don't think there is such a thing.

Although I love Texas Method and it's done me well, it's so brutal now. The volume days take every ounce of mental fortitude in me. If I don't get plenty of carbs and coffee right before my workout I am done for. My lifts have stalled more, my OHP and bench are tough to move. I want to move onto a new program. I'm not sure what. I keep seeing 5/3/1 around the corner but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that or what variant would be good for me. (I only have 3 days a week to train in the gym so full body BBB or 5/3/1 for beginners maybe?)

**TL;DR: Gym noob makes good gains by progressively lifting more weight.**

9d02xh,weightroom,"[Meet Report] Top Lifter IV - Sydney, NSW, Australia (550 @ 98.5kg, 336.76 - 25 yrs old)","## Background
  
I’ve been training consistently for almost three years, focusing on getting swole and then moving into powerlifting-specific work. I’ve run Greyskull, Candito’s Linear and 6 Week programs, GZCL The Rippler and Jacked and Tan 2.0, and Matt Gary’s powerlifting program from MyStrengthBook in the past. I competed a year ago, but a string of minor injuries usually caused by my own stupidity has kept me from a consistent training block since then. 
  
  
## The Training Cycle

I took a look at Average to Savage, and decided to run that for my meet prep. I liked it because it was dead simple, used AMRAPS to regulate progression, and very easy to change based on my personal needs each block. Given the timing of the meet, I repeated Block Two again to time my peak properly. 
  
I made a couple of alterations to the program. After the first block, my bench had regressed significantly. In hindsight, I dropped my weekly pressing volume by half, so of course my bench regressed. To fix this, I added Greg’s 3x Medium Int Bench to the program, and my bench shot back up. 
  
My squat always feels like it's going to murder me at the bottom, so for the last eight weeks I used a Juggernaut pause squat progression as my squat T2. Pause squats rule. 
  
The cycle was injury-free apart from a tweaked QL I got from a deadlift AMRAP five weeks out. My chiro wasn't that worried, so I took a couple of weeks off squats and deadlifts and hammered volume while it recovered. I think this hurt me a little bit in that I missed exposure to high intensities in the last block. 
  
  
## Diet

Diet-wise, the goal was to get into the upper 90s. As a tall dude, this meant eating 4000+ calories a day. I didn't really bother with macros as I knew I was getting enough protein. I ended up gaining about 8 kilos, mostly muscle, over this prep which I'm stoked about.
  
  
## Goals
  
Get the highest total I could while making the most attempts possible. I knew I wasn't going to set any records, so this was about practicing a successful meet. I… kind of succeeded with this.
  
## Meet Day
  
I was in the 105kg class, so there was no need to cut weight. I simply woke up, had coffee and breakfast, and headed to the venue. 
  
## Squats
I'm terrible at judging squats. Everything over 3 plates feels heavy, so I decided to open a little lighter and suss out how it moved. 
  
[175kg/385lb](https://youtu.be/IUrASBQ1jPw)
Felt heavy, moved like a dream, but I made my first rookie error of the day and jumped the rack command. As soon as I moved my feet I knew I'd fucked up. You can see me grinning in the footage as I was saying to my brother half an hour beforehand “now the last thing you want to do is jump the rack command.” 3 reds. 
  
[185kg/407lb](https://youtu.be/qr1sDfDnkqs)
Despite the error, I decided to go up. I was pretty confident I had it, and I was right. This moved smoothly, so I took the lower of my planned thirds. 3 whites.
  
[195kg/430lb](https://youtu.be/d4aBylQ-VLc) - 30kg PR, 40kg meet PR
Again, felt heavy on the walkout, but it went up pretty smoothly. It felt like an RPE 10, but looking back at the footage, I had a bit more in the tank. The eternal quest not to sandbag my squats continues. 3 whites. 
  
  
## Bench
  
I was feeling pretty confident in my bench. Pressing three times a week had done a lot to ingrain decent technique.
  
122.5kg/270lb - No Video
Moved like an opener. 3 whites.
  
[130kg/286lb](https://youtu.be/qLUmSG5RPwk)
Moved like a second, so I opted for a 5kg jump. 3 whites.
  
[135kg/297lb](https://youtu.be/UaiHqQCHuKQ) - 7.5kg PR, 20kg meet PR
Now this was an RPE 10. The rep took about 7 seconds, but I knew it was going up so I kept pushing. I couldn't be happier with my attempt selection here. 3 whites. 
  
  
## Deadlifts
  
I wasn’t as confident in my deadlifts, as they felt kind of slow off the floor in my warmup and not as snappy as I would have liked.
  
[210kg/463lb](https://youtu.be/OgPSuGeeSU8)
Moved well, but I got a red for not locking my hips out fully. 2 whites.
  
[220kg/485lb](https://youtu.be/vf1wvEChzbE)
Got it off the floor and locked it out without an issue, but in my second rookie mistake of the day, I dropped it before the down command. 3 reds. 
  
[220kg/485lb](https://youtu.be/yf_CzSDfKHs) - 10kg PR, 35kg meet PR
I wasn’t confident that I could get 230kg off the floor (it was my first time pulling with thin plates in months) so I took the safe option, locked it out, held it way past the down command, and got the whites for this one. 3 whites. 
  
Total: 550kg, 95kg meet PR. I came third in my weight class, which was good enough for a medal, but not even close to some of the beasts I competed with. The guy that won the class totalled 692.5kg from memory, which is a world’s qualifying total and my lifetime goal. I also saw an unofficial masters deadlift record and two 300kg deadlift attempts, which were super cool.
  
In terms of the meet organisation, everything went smoothly. The flights were quick, so we started lifting at 10am and were pretty much done by 2:30pm.
  
  
## Lessons
  
Doing a meet without a handler is really making things hard for yourself. I didn’t have one as I’ve been doing all my own programming, and PA doesn’t allow handlers that aren’t already registered (and have paid the $125AUD fee per year), so I couldn’t bring my brother backstage to help me out. It meant that my attempt selection was a lot less reactive to conditions on the day, and I had to lean heavily on my plan and ignore how the weights felt to an extent because my body is a liar. If I want to maximise my total, I’ll definitely get a dedicated handler. It’s useful even down to little things like holding my phone and submitting attempts. There were a couple of times I had to finish the lift, walk backstage, find my attempt selection slip, borrow a pen because someone had nicked mine, then scrawl down a number while my hands were going numb from my wraps and submit it before a minute was up. 
  
## Lifts
I need to work on two things for my squats. One, my walkout. In the videos, it’s pretty shaky. This would do a lot to quell my nerves and the feeling of heaviness on my back. 
  
Two, my depth. I squat way deeper than necessary, which wouldn’t be a problem except it only happens at heavier weights. 
  
These problems can both be solved by more frequent exposure to heavy singles. I think I’ll adopt a more aggressive over-warm strategy in future, working up to RPE 7-9 before my work sets for squats or taking inspiration from UHF’s high intensity programming for squat peaking. 
  
Bench: Dunno, keep benching? But seriously, I probably need to add some tricep work to get that lockout happening better.
  
Deads: Don’t drop it early. More form work. My sumo feels patchy and slow off the floor, so that will be a big focus for me over the next period of time. My hip mobility is a constant battle as a tall dude, so I’ll keep doing hip airplanes and tactical frogs. 
  
  
## What’s Next
  
Like I was talking about in the daily, I’ve got a couple of things I want to address in the next few months:
  
  
- Take a bit of time away from the big three. I've been hammering them for the better part of half a year, so it's time to step back for a little while (sorry #specificitygang). I'm thinking to use close variations as main movements and bring those up.
- Improve body composition. I've gained a fair amount of size these last few months, about 10kg, and I'm getting a little fluffy (16-17%bf). I remember reading one of GZCL's blogs where he talked about getting your body used to your new size after a bulk, and I think that makes intuitive sense, particularly when you look at some of the research on weight loss and setting new ""set points"" after losing weight. So I'm going to hang out at this weight for a couple of months, ramp up my conditioning and work, eat at maintenance and see if I can't drop a touch of fat, up my work capacity, and gain a bit of muscle. This should set me up for either a quick cut for my next block or a slow bulk so I can finally fill out my weight class.
  
I’m thinking a volume-matched version of Powerbuilder by Brian Alsruhe with more bench. After that, I’ll jump back into Average to Savage, and add some overwarms to keep that practice at higher weights throughout volume blocks. 
  
Thanks for reading! Any comments on my form or meet strategy are more than welcome.",2018-09-04 21:48:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/9d02xh/meet_report_top_lifter_iv_sydney_nsw_australia/

**Meet Prep**

Coming off what was probably my best meet so far (880 kg/1940 lbs @ 118.4 kg/261 lbs in wraps), I jumped right back into training to compete in sleeves for the first time in about a year and a half. Based on how some recent progression was going, I had numbers like a 660+ lb squat, 463+ lb bench, and 770+ lb deadlift in mind. I even thought that if the stars aligned, I might have a 500 Wilks in me in sleeves, even though I only just broke that mark in wraps recently.

As I’ve done for quite a while now, I ran an 8 day split with a heavy bench workout, heavy squat/deadlift workout, light/volume bench workout, and light/volume squat workout with off days every other day. I explained a lot of the reasoning behind my split and exercise selection in [my last meet report](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/7xviop/meet_report_8800_kg_1184_kg_1940_lbs_261_lbs_507/), but this method has worked well for me for a while so I felt no need to change it up.

Unfortunately I ran into some shoulder issues that required quite a bit of time off along with some physical therapy so I knew my bench would fall back a little bit. As I was dealing with shoulder issues, squat and deadlift were feeling great. I started front squatting on my light squat days for this meet prep and felt a boost in quad strength pretty quickly, but had to cut them out when I noticed the bar laying across my collarbone was aggravating my bad shoulder. That and a few knee tweaks during the warm up sets on my last couple heavy squat days actually had me feeling pretty worried about my squat 3-5 weeks out. Somehow, about 10-15 days out from the meet, I managed to get everything back on track. I got a few really low volume bench workouts in and some decent squat and deadlift singles, which boosted my confidence quite a bit, even if my training lifts weren’t quite what I’d initially hoped.

**Weigh-ins and Meet Day**

I live about 45 minutes from the meet venue so travel wasn’t an issue. I was thinking about doing a couple of rounds in a hot bath the morning before weigh-ins to sweat out a couple pounds, but I really didn’t feel like it when I woke up, so all I did was skip breakfast. I was hoping to be around 120 kg and weighed in at 120.1 kg so that turned out fine. I still have a lot of room in my weight class, but I’m in no rush to fill it out. I also didn’t feel like eating like as much of a maniac as I usually do the day before a meet, but I think I ate and drank enough to get up to a little over 270 lbs before bed.

Openers were set at a 584 lb squat, 402 lb bench, and 694 lb deadlift. I realized that these openers totalled over 200 lbs more than my total at my first meet, so it was kind of cool to look back and see that kind of progress.

The meet was at a huge convention center with all kinds of things going on besides the powerlifting meet. I got there about 2 hrs before my flight started so I had plenty of time to warm up slowly.

Planned squat attempts were a 622 lb second attempt and a 633-651 lb third attempt depending on how the second attempt felt. Planned bench attempts were a 424 lb second attempt and a 429-440 lb third attempt. For deadlifts, I was pretty set on giving 771 lbs a try for my third no matter what.

**Squat:**

My best training squat was a slow single at 630 lbs. I felt super comfortable with my opening weight because it had moved really well about 6 different times during training. In the 8 full power meets I’ve done, I’ve never had a single red light for squats and I really wanted to keep it that way. I think it’s such a confidence builder to go 3/3 for squats that I don’t mind leaving 5-10 lbs on the platform sometimes. Warm ups felt great and my last single at 540 lbs moved like it was nothing.

* 1st Attempt: 265 kg/584 lbs. We used a 25 kg squat bar for this meet and I really like having the stability of a thicker bar over the standard bar, especially when squatting above about 550 lbs. This attempt moved surprisingly quickly, so I was already preparing to take a stab at the high end of my third attempt range.
* 2nd Attempt: 282.5 kg/622 lbs. This was an 11 lb meet PR from the last meet I did in sleeves about a year and a half ago. It felt just as easy as my opener so I went for the high end of my third attempt range.
* 3rd Attempt: 295.5 kg/651 lbs. This was a USPA drug tested world record, but it was one of those lame/undercompeted records where the national record is actually higher than the world record so nothing to get too excited about, but I went for the 0.5 kg chip just to take it. As soon as I unracked it, I knew I’d make the lift. Really happy at this point to have avoided any more knee tweaks and to feel confident going into bench and deadlift. The only thing that worries me looking back at the video of this attempt is the slight right knee shift in the hole. Not sure if it started with my knee or with my hips being slightly off line, but that’s definitely something to stay aware of. This was a 40 lb PR over the last time I competed in sleeves.

**Bench:**

I really surprised myself at my last meet after locking out 208 kg/458 lbs. I had been struggling to get past the 200 kg barrier for 3 or 4 meets in a row and after some tweaks to my training, I finally felt like bench was moving again. The beginning of this training cycle was going great and I was smashing my PRs for bench rep maxes, but eventually all the pressing caught up with me and I had to take quite a bit of time off of barbell benching to recover from a grumpy right shoulder. I was diagnosed with minor AC joint arthritis, rotator cuff inflammation, and a small labrum tear, though the labrum tear could have happened at any point during my 17 years of baseball so the doctors weren’t convinced that was currently causing me any trouble. I think it was some combination of overuse, mobility, an aggravated collarbone from front squatting, supinating my right hand when deadlift, and possibly a few other small factors. I was prescribed anti-inflammatory meds and physical therapy and the rehab made a pretty big difference very quickly. Anyway, I was coming into this meet just hoping to be within 20-30 lbs of my PR.

* 1st Attempt: 182.5 kg/402 lbs. This was 2.5 kg lighter than my opener at my last meet, which I believe is the first time I have ever taken a lower opener than a previous meet, but I wasn’t too upset about it considering the shoulder issues. This felt really easy and I noticed everyone was getting lightning fast press commands.
* 2nd Attempt: 192.5 kg/424 lbs. Unless my first attempt really went poorly, I was planning on making this 10 kg jump. Again I got a very quick press command and locked this out without too much trouble.
* 3rd Attempt: 200 kg/440 lbs. I had only managed 4 real bench workouts in the three weeks leading up to the meet and those were the only real bench workouts for the previous 2 months or so. The heaviest weights I hit for singles were 424 lbs raw and 435 lbs with a slingshot. Usually I like to do some overload work above my projected max, but I couldn’t really fit it into the program this time and didn’t want to hurt my shoulder any more. Based on how my second attempt felt, I decided to try 440 lbs instead of 429-435 and it turned out surprisingly well. My shoulder felt fine and I might have even had another 2.5 kg left. Looking back at the video, this was about as touch and go as a competition bench can get. I would have liked it to be a tiny bit stricter, but I don’t think it would have made any difference.

**Deadlift:**

Deadlifts have always felt very natural to me and I put a lot of work into them so it’s not too surprising that I like them a lot. I pulled 345 kg/760 lbs at my last meet after squatting in wraps, so I figured that competing in sleeves this time would leave me with a little more left in the tank by the time I got to deadlifts in addition to whatever strength I’ve gained since that meet. Like I mentioned earlier, I was pretty set on a 350 kg/771 lb third attempt no matter what. We didn’t have a deadlift bar backstage, but warm ups at 365 lbs x 3, 495 lbs x 2, 585 lbs x 1, and 645 lbs x 1 felt like I was lifting an empty bar so I was feeling really confident.

* 1st Attempt: 315 kg/694 lbs. I was tempted to open at 317.5 or 320 kg because opening at 700+ lbs sounds cool, but I have no problem making 50ish lb jumps and saw no reason to make my opener any harder than it needed to be so I was cool with 694 lbs. Might have been a tiny bit thrown off by the extra slack in the deadlift bar compared to the stiffer bar that I warmed up on, but this was really easy. Watching the videos of all of my attempts, I think I need to space my right hand a little farther to bring up the bar a little more evenly.
* 2nd Attempt: 335 kg/738 lbs. The goal here was to make this lift a good stepping stone for a 350 kg third attempt. It moved much better than similar weights had moved in training, so I had no doubt at this point that 350 kg was there.
* 3rd Attempt: 350 kg/771 lbs. This was a huge milestone that I’d been looking forward to for a while. I was a little worried about grip, but it held strong and I even felt like I had some left in the tank. I already had some thoughts in the back of my head about taking a 4th attempt and a few people encouraged me to do so, so I took a stab at it.
* 4th Attempt: 363 kg/800 lbs. If I’m this close to 800 lbs, might as well take a shot right? I only had about 4 minutes to rest because I was at the end of my flight, but I think I was just out of gas at this point. The weight flew up to me knees and then I just couldn’t get it to budge any farther. This was probably one of the most encouraging misses that I’ve had, though, because I had great speed off the floor and I think that adding in a little banded deadlift work will bring up my lockout in no time so I can join the 800 lb club!

**Meet Thoughts**

*My Performance*

During the last leg of meet prep, I was worried that this would be the first meet that might leave me disappointed with my performance. A lot of training sessions were not going my way and I even considered dropping out or doing deadlift only a few times. All things considered, I’m actually just as proud of this meet as I was of many of my previous meets. I went 9/10 with my only miss being an 800 lb deadlift attempt. I also managed to set a few records (that probably won’t last long) and picked up two best lifter awards. I think I also would have won palest lifter if they gave out that prize. More importantly, I ended the meet without any injuries! One thing I might attribute to performing above my own expectations based on how meet prep went is that I train in a very calm state. No coffee, no pre-workout, no smelling salts, no back slaps, no screaming, etc. With that being my baseline, even just one scoop of preworkout, a little extra rest, and a competition setting is enough to get some pretty serious adrenaline going and put up some bigger numbers than I did in training. I think this is a huge part of why I have been able to consistently hit PRs on meet day.

*Other Competitors*

I think I have some misconception that because I have done so many meets now, I should stop seeing so many ‘beginner’ mistakes, but I still noticed quite a few at this meet. I know I’m not some perfect, all-knowing lifter, but I can’t help but think that a few lifters might benefit from correcting these two mistakes:

1. Opening too heavy. I saw a couple lifters grinding out their last squat warm ups backstage and it was no surprised to see them either bomb out on squats or go ⅓ on squats, wasting tons of energy by failing their second and third attempts on strength. I’ve always thought that for 99% of lifters, an opener is really supposed to serve as a confidence booster. If you’re top 5 in your weight class worldwide and want to take attempts at 96%, 100%, 102% of what you think you’re capable of, then maybe you can get away with it because you should be very technically proficient and this gives you room to set some records if your second attempt moves well. However, I think most people’s attempts should be something like 90%, 96%, 100% of their goal on meet day. Unless you’re Yury Belkin, you’re not winning the meet with your openers so stop trying to impress everyone by opening with a weight that doesn’t make sense for you. Nobody cares what your opener is, your heaviest successful attempt is what matters and that attempt should not be your opener.
2. Getting overly psyched up. I’m generally a pretty calm lifter and I understand than many lifters prefer to get a little more hyped than I do and that’s fine. When I see a lifter getting ready to deadlift take 3 rips of Nose Tork, have their training partner give them a few thunderous back slaps, scream at the top of their lungs, approach the bar, scream again, shake the bar with enough might for it to almost leave the ground, and scream one more time for good measure before actually attempting to lift the bar, I can’t help but think that there must be some wasted energy there. I also think that when a lifter gets this amped up, technique can sometimes suffer and result in a failed lift even if strength wasn’t an issue. Do what you need to do to get some adrenaline going, but don’t do it at the expense of energy and strength that could have been put into the bar during the lift instead.

*Other Thoughts*

The meet was very well run. There were plenty of spotters and loaders who worked very quickly, plenty of judges, and the meet was expedited very well. Some of the spotters/loaders and handlers of other lifters even helped load weights in the warm up area, which was really awesome. The back spotter was the man. I can’t remember his name, but I know he’s been at the last few San Jose Fit Expos and he’s one of the most genuinely encouraging dudes around, cheering on every lifter that took the stage. I also lucked out that a lifter I knew from previous meets was on the spotting/loading crew and he was nice enough to help me with lift offs for bench (thanks, Noah).

I think it’s going to take a while for the Drug Tested side of the USPA to gain traction, but they’re definitely moving in the right direction. There are so many different categories to lift in that it’s not surprising that it seemed like half the people at this meet set “world records”, but I think that in a couple years, these records will continue to fill out and start to feel a little more legit.

**Next Steps**

First thing on my agenda is to get my shoulder and knees 100% healthy. I’m planning on reducing intensity and increasing volume quite a bit and doing a lot more dumbbell work to give myself a breather from constant barbell lifts. There’s a chance I might try to compete at the USPA/IPL Drug Test World Championships in November, but only if I’m feeling healthy enough and can get enough solid training in over the next couple months. The USPA is sponsoring a team of lifters to make up Team USA for that meet and I made the preliminary roster with my Wilks at my last meet, but I think I have since been bumped out of the top 6 that they are taking on the team.

The next big goals I have are an 800+ lb deadlift and 2000+ lb total in wraps. Assuming I can get my bench back on track, I really don’t think the 2k total is far off. After that, I think another cool goal would be a 895 kg/1973 lbs total in sleeves because that would be a 500 lb increase from the first competition that I did. I really feel like I still have tons of room to grow and get stronger, so it’s really just a matter of being patient, putting in the work, and staying healthy.

Thanks for reading!!

8e0de0,weightroom,[Program Review] MomStrong by Marisa Inda,"
**The Program**
> MomStrong is a program designed to combine all elements of my training, Powerlifting, Bodybuilding, and Calisthenics into one fun and effective 12-week journey. This program will help you build muscle, hone your strength and technique in the powerlifts and maybe even get your first pullup.
-- *Fuerza* page 66

Quick disclosure: I know Marisa in real life and provided feedback on the rough draft for [*Fuerza*](https://store.jtsstrength.com/collections/digital-resources/products/fuerza-a-females-guide-to-strength-physique?variant=43851994636).  In this review, I'll do my best to distinguish between things that are explicitly stated in the book and things that were later explained/clarified in person.

Way back when, I asked Marisa why the program is called ""MomStrong"", and she said that she was basically tired of women thinking they're not strong enough to lift weights when (paraphrasing) ""lifting weights is a hell of a lot easier than pushing out a baby!"" The original MomStrong was part of an online women's lifting program that Marisa ran (runs?) via Facebook and members ranged somewhat in ability but were primarily late beginners to intermediate lifters.  As it is presented in the book, one would run the program immediately after completing the begginer program; however, there's enough information in the book to make modifications.  For instance, MomStrong includes a ""first pull-up"" progression routine that can very easily be swapped for the pull-up routine described in the Calesthenics section (pages 42-45) of the book.

Program is a 4 day per week upper/lower split with cardio scheduled for two of the non lifting days.  There are two six week long phases to the program: phase one focuses on hypertrophy and phase two focuses on strength building and working towards retesting 1RM for low bar back squat, bench, and conventional deadlift.

Each workout starts off with the main lift: squat (high bar during phase 1 and low bar during phase 2), bench (both wide grip and medium grip), and conventional deadlift.  The mainlift is followed with an auxiliary lift to improve typical weak points (for example: spoto press, sumo block pulls, paused squats, etc). And finally, 2-4 different ""bodybuilding"" moves.  Progression on lifts was generally ""up 10%/down 5%/up 10%/down 5%"" with the number of reps going up/down to keep the periodization linear.  The main lifts alternate on which one is high(er) weight/low(er) rep and which is low(er) weight/high(er) rep.  In other words, heavy/low rep squats would be followed later in the week by lighter/higher rep deadlifts, and vice versa.  So, even though the program doesn't *actually* use DUP--for me at least--it has some of the psychological benefits of a DUP routine; I could really psych myself up for nailing my lifts on ""easy"" days.  All lifts up until retesting 1RM are done at submaximal weights.


**Background**

I started lifting at the end of 2015/beginning of 2016 at 37 years old when my youngest was 11 months old after losing 60lbs through calorie counting and Couch to 5K (175lbs down to 115lbs at 5'0.5"" tall).  Windstorms were kicking up into high gear at the time; so after having a tree branch fly past my head at 40 mph, I decided that it might be a tad safer to do my running on a treadmill. Joined the local gym and upon seeing Marisa squatting a couple plates like they were nothing, thought to myself ""that looks like fun!"" Approached Marisa to ask about training, and here we are.  I met with Marisa once per week to work on my form, to go over my progress during the rest of the week, and to discuss different aspects of programming/lifting: the first six months we did PPL and the second six months we did upper/lower.  She encouraged me to use a variety of rep ranges and intensities (used estimated 1RM calculator to make sure I was progressing).  One thing that I *really* appreciate about Marisa's training is that she made sure I learned enough to be able to work independently once she shifted her focus to preparing for competitions and coaching online clients through Juggernaut. By the end of the year, I could lift 115 lbs (squat 3RM), 95 lbs (bench 1RM), and 185 lbs (conventional deadlift).

I played around with a few different programs over the following year: gave GZCLP a try (liked it, but stalled pretty quickly), a couple different programs from one of Greg Nuckols' guides (*not* the 28 free programs one), and finally just winged it a bit with a calculator and a basic understanding of how a non-moronic day of lifting should look.  I still have training with Marisa once in a blue moon, and she's just *very* sweet about offering a quick form check when she's resting between sets. 

**My Progress on MomStrong**

I didn't bother re-testing my maxes before starting MomStrong.  I ran the program for two full cycles and, after consulting with Marisa, aimed for 7-8RPE to start. 

One small complaint that I have is that the percentages given are next to impossible to follow for someone with poverty lifts working out in a gym with plates no smaller than 2.5 lbs.  Since I was bulking, I didn't face much difficulty with my e1RM creeping up; but someone, maintaining or cutting weight would 100% need to invest in a set of fractional plates.  RPE guidelines would have helped. 

For bench, I started out using 95 lbs to calculate percentages; however, I gradually found that I needed to use a slightly higher weight for the intensity to feel ""right"".  For the first cycle, I increased my training max to 100 lbs (and ended the cycle with a 96 lb tested max).  Similarly, for the second cycle, my training max went from 100 lbs up to 105 lbs (but, again, my tested max ended up being much lower at 100 lbs). 

For squat, my previous 1RM for high bar was 125lbs.  I decided to use 130lbs as my starting input for low bar; however, both high bar and low bar calculations gradually crept up. By the end of the first cycle, I was using 135 lbs to calculate my lifts (and actually hit 135 lbs when I tested my max).  By the end of the second cycle, my training max was 145 lbs (and hit 145 lbs when I tested.)

For conventional deadlift, my previous 1RM was 185lbs and on a particularly low gravity day, a 6RM of 170lbs (a calculated max of 200lbs).  I started with 190lbs for my inputs but gradually crept up to 205lbs.  At the end of 12 weeks, I could pull 215 lbs at what felt like a 9.5RPE.  I kept the training max at 215 lbs for the second cycle and was able to hit 215 lbs for closer to an 8RPE.  I think if I planned my warm-up a bit better, I could have hit 220.  Oh, well.

Although it isn't a ""powerlift"", the program spends a good deal of time working on improving pull-ups.  I started the first cycle already able to do one pull-up, could do two pull-ups by the end of the first cycle, and 3 (almost 4; managed to get my nose over the top of the bar) by the end of the second cycle.

 **Changes/Adjustments**

* During the first cycle, I did my best to run the program as written; however, as mentioned above, my training max *did* end up increasing due to bulking.  
* I found that benching up to 90% of my max (whereas the program goes to 85% before testing) was necessary for me to feel confident enough to try out heavier weights.  
* On the second cycle, I did belt squats instead of front squats due to form issues severely limiting the amount of weight that I was moving.  Per Marisa's feedback, I did the belt squats for higher reps (12-15 vs 6-8) to work my quads more.
 * I swapped out a few of the suggested bodybuilding lifts to focus on my trouble spots. Rear foot elevated split squats instead of front foot elevated, skipped calf raises (I am genetically blessed in this department), and added hip abduction/adduction (for better knee stability, especially since I run for cardio).
* I could already do one pull-up at the start of the program, so I substituted the advice given in the Calisthenics section.
* I came down with a stomach bug halfway through the second cycle and decided to reset to a few weeks earlier in the program (instead of doing a deload or just staying the course).  I now know that I *should* have done the deload... It ended up being an additional three weeks before I got to deload and I pretty much wanted to die.


**My Diet**

As mentioned earlier, I lost 60lbs before I started lifting.  I *don't* weigh my food; instead, I use visual guidelines (e.g. a serving of protein is the same size as a deck of cards), and this strategy works just dandy for me.  My squats had stalled for a while, so even though it was genuinely daunting for me to do so, I decided to stop tracking calories and allowed myself to bulk from 120 to 130 lbs.  Measurements have gone from 36-30-36 to 37-29-37.

Typical day: eggs on toast with a cup of coffee for breakfast, ham and eggs with a side salad for lunch, tri-tip with brussel sprouts for dinner, and a protein shake made with kefir and frozen fruit for a snack.  When I remember, I take creatine, fish oil, and D3.

Totals: if my Apple Watch isn't *completely* inaccurate, I maintain at around ~1800 calories--so I'm probably eating ~1900.  Using visual guesstimates, my protein intake is around 100-120 grams per day.


**Conclusions**
* Fatigue management is fantastic.  The only time that I had trouble with the lifts was when I *didn't* take a deload at the scheduled time.
* Spending 12 weeks at submaximal weights really allowed me a chance to focus on improving  my form, which (along with bulking) seemed to have the biggest impact on getting my squats to finally start moving again.
* The bodybuilding portion is very balanced.  Marisa doesn't dictate what the exact shape of your butt should be or assume that women only want to look a certain way; instead, she makes clear at several points throughout *Fuerza* that the book should be viewed as a toolkit and that users can adjust frequency for individual physique goals.
 * Although my immediate plan for the future is to run the physique program from *Fuerza* while cutting 10-15 lbs, I will definitely be running MomStrong again.  The 4 day per week schedule allows for a great deal of flexibility and I like being able to work on more than one goal at a time.

**Training Background**

I've been lifting for a few years now. Prior to 2016 I was mostly concerned with weight loss and fitness, I dropped from a high of about 265 to 215. I was on Starting Strength for a long time (way too long) and worked through a back injury in 2015. After plateauing in late 2016 I was fed up and decided to give 5/3/1 a shot. Read 5/3/1 and Beyond. I varied between 5/3/1 BBB and FSL with some Triumvirate mixed in.

When my deadlift broke 4 plates I started to think about competing. Thought it would be fun to test myself. I tested my maxes around the new year and then did 5/3/1 Strength Challenge as my meet prep/tapering. I selected this program as I was largely already familiar with the 5/3/1 methodology and training principles, so it was easy to adapt my workouts to this slightly different form. It was also an easy and succinct way to plan tapering, and incorporate some heavy singles.

It should also be noted that I received my lifting belt at the start of this program, so the starting PRs are all beltless and the ending ones belted.

**Overview**

5/3/1 Strength Challenge is peaking/meet prep program from Beyond 5/3/1. It follows a similar basic methodology to other 5/3/1 programs, but weeks are organized as 3/5/1 as opposed to 5/3/1. The main movements are structured as follows

In week 1, you perform 3 sets of 3+ reps, and an additional single at your training max. Week 2, 3 sets of 5, no AMRAP. Week 3, 5/3/1+, and an additional single at your training max. Week 4, deload. The only exception is OHP, which does not have additional singles performed.

Assistance for the first 4 weeks is similar to a BBB protocol; 5 sets of 10 reps of an assistance movement, with an equivalent volume of opposite movement or abdominal work. For example, pressing/pulling for OHP and bench, multi-joint leg movement and abs for dealift, low back and abs for squat.

Optional assistance is 1-3 extra exercises for 1-3 sets for each movement to address weak points. Triceps, biceps, and upper back for OHP and bench; quads, hamstrings, and grip for deadlifts and squat.

Weeks 5-8 are structured similarly, except the last set on 3 and 1 days are no longer AMRAP; that is reserved for the training max.

Thus, in week 5 you perform 3 sets of 3 reps and an AMRAP at your training max. In week 6 you perform 3x5, no AMRAP. In week 7, 5/3/1 and an AMRAP at your training max. Week 8, deload.

Assistance work is reduced to 3 sets of your main movements, plus optional assistance.

Finally, weeks 9-12 are structured to peak towards setting a PR.

In week 9 you perform 3 sets of 3 reps, no AMRAP, a single at your training max, and a single at 110% of your training max. In week 10, you perform 3x5, no AMRAP or singles. In week 11, you perform 5/3/1, no AMRAP, a single at your training max, and test your 1rm.

Main assistance lifts are eliminated in this cycle to reduce volume.

*Conditioning*

3 days/week of conditioning are recommended for all weeks. Recommended conditioning is Prowler push, 2 mile walk, weighted vest walk, or air dyne bike.

**My Set Up**

I performed the main lifts as directed.

For main assistance, I basically performed a BBB protocol with supersets. On OHP day, I performed incline or close-grip bench alternating with barbell rows of the same weight and same or greater reps. For deadlift, I performed squats @50-60% superset with ab roller. For bench, I performed incline or close-grip bench superset with weighted pull-ups. For squat, I performed deadlift superset with hanging leg raise.

For optional assistance, on OHP day I would do bodyweight pull-ups, dips, and low cable row. On deadlift day, I would do hamstring curls, VMO drops, and kettlebell swings. On bench day, I would do dumbbell rows, face pull, and lateral/side raises. On squat day, I would do leg press, leg extensions, and high box step-ups. I usually performed these last assistance exercises as a giant set.

For conditioning, I ran 5-7 km 2-3 times a week. I also played ball hockey once a week, and went skiing a few times. I also walk 2-3 km for my commute each day.


**Diet**

I did not follow a specific diet, nor did I track calories. However I tried to get a minimum of 160g protein a day (all sources), a variety of vegetables and fruits, and avoided most simple sugars/sweets. I tracked my weight each workout and tried to regulate my intake such that I maintained my bodyweight. Bodyweight fluctuated between 225-232 lbs, with clothes and shoes on.

On days/ days after heavy singles, I found eating more beneficial or necessary.

Typical day;

Breakfast; coffee, greek yogurt with berries and low-sugar granola *or* scrambled eggs with spinach, cheese, and salsa

Snack; coffee, banana

Lunch: leftovers, sandwich, salad with protein source

Afternoon; scoop of whey

Dinner; heavier meal such as fish tacos, pasta with meat sauce, grilled meat and roast veg

1/2 hour before bed; scoop of whey

**Sleep**

I try my best to sleep 10PM-6AM every day; many days I would be in bed somewhat later, 10:15-10:45. I'm not good at sleeping in so 6AM is pretty regular. No time for naps.

**Results**

Unfortunately, I set this up to test my 1rm at a meet, and my [poor technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/87k8yz/meet_report_blm_spring_showdown35mraw_475kgs/?st=jfu41phs&sh=e7c3368a) meant I didn't get to really test my strength - I only hit my openers for bench and squat and modest PR for deadlift.

However, I did set PRs in each lift at 110% of my training max, and by rep max standards I improved quite a bit. Except in bench, where I feel I was due for a deload anyways.

Rep max: Squat 325x5 (est. 1rm 366) -> 325x9 (418)

Bench; N/A (265 -> 270)

Deadlift: 405x6 (470) -> 430x6 (499)

**Discussion**

This program was probably a bit of overkill for someone at my strength level - a simple reduction in volume in the final weeks leading up to a meet probably would have worked as effectively.

I definitely liked the experience of working in some heavy singles, it gave me a lot of confidence, particularly in the deadlift.

I don't have experience with other programs to compare with, but I think this would be an adequate peaking program for an average or intermediate (insert your particular definition here) lifter looking to prep for their first meet.

I'm sure 5/31 Forever has an updated/more effective or alternative version of this or a similar peaking program that may work better for you.

I achieved some progress in squat and deadlift, but bench was pretty stalled. I had made a fair amount of progress leading up to this program with bench though, so it's possible I was due for a deload.

Right now, I am focused on a 10km adventure mountain run at the end of the month. I am running 3x a week at longer distances. I have also started Brian Alsruhe's Powerbuilder program to mix things up, improve conditioning, and try different movements.",2018-04-16 17:25:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/8cpa8t/program_review_531_strength_challenge/
8bso56,weightroom,"[Highland Games Report] - Spring Fling ProAm 2018 - Bellevue, Nebraska, April 7th","Last Saturday I had the opportunity to pack up the family and drive through a snow storm to attend the 4th or 5th Annual Spring Fling Highland Games in Bellevue, Nebraska. It’s only a 3 hour drive so it’s not too bad and I’m good friends with the Athletic Director so I enjoy supporting him when I can. Also, it’s a great Games to attend because they do a ProAm Divison which pairs a current Pro, an amateur man and an amateur woman and then they do battle team style. I competed in the A Class alongside two other throwers. (*Because apparently 7 other dudes were too wussy to show up*) I’ve made the decision to jump into A Class full-time because I will improve faster and I enjoy throwing with better competition, quite frankly.

We all knew it was going to be a cold day, and it definitely was. When I got to the field at 8 AM it was 18 degrees and the high only ended up being 45. All in all, it wasn’t as terrible as I imagined it would be. I wore thermal tights, compression shorts, my kilt, a t-shirt, a thermal top, and a hoodie and I ended up being pretty comfortable most of the day. I ate a pretty large meal the night before and then hit up my go-to Panera for a breakfast sandwich and a coffee before throwing started.

The ProAm ended up being the biggest divison, obviously, so they threw the traditional order. We quickly found out that there were only 3 A throwers (*Podium!*) and we ended up starting off with hammers. I actually had to run my tacky over to a propane heater where spectators were sitting to warm it up so I could apply it to my hands.

**Heavy Hammer:** Anyone who knows me knows that I’m terrible at throwing the hammers. I haven’t found the right cue to make these click, but they *are* improving.. slowly. I took plenty of practice winds and things were actually feeling okay. Rather than throw and measure very throw independently, and because there were only 3 of us, we would throw and the guys in the field would mark our throw with a flag. If we beat a previous throw the flag would move, otherwise, we kept it in its place. This sped things up tremendously but also means I only know what my farthest throw was. I ended up taking 2nd with a throw of 64’10.5” which is only about 4” short of my all-time PR. I’ll take it. Hammers will be getting a lot more attention in training so that hopefully I can top 80’ this year with the heavy.

**Light Hammer:** Same thing, just six pounds lighter. I ended up throwing 68’1” which is about 12’ off my best throw. Not sure what happened on this looking back, because the throws felt fine. Oh well.

**Braemar:** After hammer we moved to the stones. I’m not someone with a track and field background, so throwing stones is just as foreign to me as any of the events. The Braemar we had was only 19 lbs but it was very big and very round. I had trouble getting it into a good position and being able to hold that position against my neck. Somehow, I managed to throw a PR with my best throw going 30’5.5” but it wasn’t good enough for 1st because that guy threw 37’ even. I’ll keep working on the stones and just try to improve as best I can.

**Open Stone:** With the ground covered in snow I wasn’t confident about using an approach, so I ended up Braemaring most of my Open Stone attempts. I ended up throwing 34’7” which is middle of the pack for my average stone throws. It’s fine. Stones are dumb, anyway.

**Sheaf:** From the most boring events we moved onto what I consider the crowd favorite. Sheaf. My bread and butter. I failed to mention that one of the throwers in A Class had literally never thrown before (*He didn’t know about the classes and no one caught it before the day of*) so he was in for a world of surprise when he realized he needed a pitchfork for this sport. We spent a good long time trying to show him how to throw this wacky event. He tried 16’ but couldn’t clear the bar and then my competition and I started out at 20’. Both of us destroyed 20’ and moved onto 22’ which we also destroyed. Things started getting weird at 24’ where I damn near shit the bed and got myself out. Something felt *off* when I threw and I attribute it to the recent cold weather causing my wooden handle to shrink ever so slightly so that it was loose in the fork head. As such, my throws were all shooting off to the left whereas I normally throw dead center of the standards. To counteract this I moved *significantly* to the right and managed to clear the bar on my 3rd attempt. After that I nailed 26’ first try with my new adjustment in place and my opponent failed to clear the bar. I took 28’ for my final height, which would have been a 1’ PR with a 20 lb bag, but I couldn’t get the job done. Oh well.

**WOB:** Weight over Bar is something I feel like I should be way better at given my static strength. I tend to come in at 11’, destroy that, clear 12’ and it kind of depends on the day whether I’ll clear 13’ or not. I only managed to clear 12’ that day but I’m going to make a conscious effort to practice WOB more often and I have officially made it my goal to clear 14’+ before the year’s over. I believe what’s holding me back the most currently is the fact I don’t reach back nearly enough when I cast the weight between my legs.

**Heavy Weight for Distance:** The weights were about the only thing I managed to practice this off-season prior to this competition and I was **not** confident going in. I decided the day of that I would one-turn my first throw to get points on the board before I’d start 2-turning. This ended up being a fantastic decision because my best throw on the day was my first one-turn with a throw of 24’2.5”. This is about 6’ off my all-time best throw, but it *felt* so much easier and I definitely threw with less effort. I’m thinking I’ll one-turn all of my HWFD throws moving forward until they are second nature. I hope to be comfortably throwing over 30’ with a one-turn before the year’s over.

**Light Weight for Distance:** Same story. One-turned the first throw but felt like it was a wasted effort because I can keep the LWFD controlled when I 2-turn. Ended up taking 1st with a throw of 55’ which is about 5’ off my best. I’m hoping to finish the year with throws in the high 60’s or low 70’s.

**Caber:** Caber is.. weird. We all know that. For some reason I rush caber so hard. I was happy with my picks but I’m just not patient enough when it comes to caber. Ideally I should pick, let it settle, start walking, sprint and get that bastard moving all before I plant and pull, but I tend to pick, jog, pull. I think this is because in my previous Games we’ve thrown lighter B/C Class Cabers that don’t require as much work as the heavier and longer cabers I’ll be seeing more of as an A. I ended up only getting 75 degrees on what was, what I considered, a very turnable caber. Oh well. I’ll keep chugging along.

**Overall:** At the end of the day I was happy with how my throws went and how I felt when it was all over with, considering I didn’t even *think* about throwing this off-season. The 3 hour drive home wasn’t too bad and I wasn’t ever overly-stiff or exhausted. I’ll be mixing in throwing more often now that we’re firmly in the season but I’m not going to drop the Big 3 because I throw worse if I feel weak. My next Highland Games will be April 22nd when I compete in Wichita. This Games will be a nice transition from what was otherwise a full day of practice, given that I’ll be throwing against a full group of competitive A Class throwers.

87k8yz,weightroom,[Meet Report] BLM Spring Showdown|35M|Raw 475kgs @ 99.5kgs|289 Wilks,"I had a mostly good experience, unfortunately only went 4/9 on my lifts. I **didn't** bomb out though, so there's that.

**Background & Training**

I've been lifting for a few years now. Prior to 2016 I was mostly concerned with weight loss and fitness, I dropped from a high of about 265 to 215. I was on Starting Strength for a long time (way too long) and worked through a back injury in 2015. After plateauing in late 2016 I was fed up and decided to give 5/3/1 a shot. Read 5/3/1 and Beyond. I varied between 5/3/1 BBB and FSL with some Triumvirate mixed in.

When my deadlift broke 4 plates I started to think about competing. Thought it would be fun to test myself. I tested my maxes around the new year and then did 5/3/1 Strength Challenge as my meet prep/tapering. I liked this program a lot and can write it up if anyone's interested.

**Meet Day**

Meet was held in a hotel conference room. All meet we were under threat for being shut down because the Dennys below us was complaining and apparently a crack formed in their roof lol. 

Definitely good vibes, everyone was friendly and helpful. The venue was a bit chaotic and very tight so it was hard to find room to warm up. Guys were good about sharing warmups/bars etc.

Weighed in at 99.5kg which was lighter than anticipated. I didn't cut but watched sodium intake before the meet, had a light breakfast and coffee for poops. Crammed as much food (mostly carbs) in after weigh ins as I could.

I was in the last flight so there was a lot of waiting around. I had no handler which I was a bit nervous about but it wasn't a problem (except for noting technical issues, which we'll get to).

Goals were - don't bomb out; 9/9; PR each lift; 300+ wilks; 500+kgs.

**Squats**

1st 155kg - no lift. Judge informed me that I had to fully wrap my fingers around the bar, which I had never heard before (neither had other guys).

2nd 155kg - no lift. Didn't fully lock out the knees. 

3rd 155kg - good lift. Obviously I was nervous at this point about bombing out so I tried to be as calm as possible. Got this one OK but this is something I can hit for 5 in the gym so I had way more in the tank.

**Bench**

1st 105kg - no lift. I dropped my opener from 107.5 to remain confident. I don't know exactly why I got the red lights except the judge mentioned I needed to lower my rack heights, which I did.

2nd 105 - good lift. Got one red for almost jumping the start command. I've done this for 5 in the gym.

3rd 115 - no lift. I dunno. Jumped a command or moved a foot or something.

**Deadlifts**

At this point I was disappointed I wasn't near the total I wanted. I had a friend I'd recently made in my gym who was competing in the 93kg class so he was done. His girlfriend/handler offered to handle and video my deadlifts which I gratefully accepted. Turned out to help.

1st - 200kg - no lift. Bobbled/lowered slightly at the top.

2nd - 200kg - good lift. I was very calm and solid as a rock.

3rd - [215kg - good lift.](https://gfycat.com/UniformDemandingCricket) A small PR (previous was 470 lbs). I had been hoping to jump to 225 or 227.5 for thirds but I'll take the PR.

Overall a little disappointed with my overall performance and wish I had a better grasp of the technical issues, as I know I could lift more. But glad I finished and was able to get a PR and of course now I have meet PRs!

Oddly enough because I happened to be in a weak class (3x 105kg lifters) I took 2nd in my class with only a 289 Wilks/475 kg total.

Lessons learned, I need to be better about technical faults. I'm a little annoyed because I'm a casual/recreational lifter and I'd prefer not to have to pay for a coach, so we'll see what I do going forward. I have a 10km mountain adventure run to train for coming up, but I'll keep working on my lifts too.",2018-03-27 17:19:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/87k8yz/meet_report_blm_spring_showdown35mraw_475kgs/
8680e8,weightroom,[Program Review] Stronger By Science 28 Programs - 3xWeek Beginner Squat + 3xWeek Beginner Bench + 2xWeek Beginner Deadlift,"I’ve been a lurker here for quite a while, and the sub has been a huge help to me.

[Squat](https://youtu.be/Km_ld9CW6kQ?t=19s)


[Bench](https://youtu.be/NnfiLg66Fl0) (I just realized that my hoodie obscures my butt and the angle obscures my chest, so you’ll just have to trust me that I didn’t lift off the bench and I touched).  Fun fact, my spotter is the same age as me, a few pounds lighter, and has a 1200-1250 total in competition, definitely a big inspiration for me.


[Deadlift](https://youtu.be/FbZ12IJRpvI?t=18s)


I think my squat might not have passed in competition, I’m not sure if the bar dips down or not.  I don’t think I paused long enough on the bench, but I think I could’ve gotten it with a longer pause.  With the deadlift, I do lock out at the top but I lose my balance.  Probably wouldn’t have counted in competition, but for a gym PR, I’m ok with it.

Any form advice would be greatly appreciated!


#History


My first serious experience with sports was in Freshman and Sophomore year of High School.  I joined the swim team and trained for a total of ~16 months.  I was never an exceptional swimmer, but I wasn’t bad – my 50m Freestyle time was 31s.  I think swimming built a base for my body, giving me some muscle, conditioning, and significantly improved my proprioception.


I tried to lift somewhat sporadically.  However, all my gym had was a smith machine.  I managed to learn some squat form, but nothing for bench and deadlift.  Also, swim practice took up so much energy that I couldn’t stick to lifting.


Because my family moved after Sophomore year, I quit the swim team.  After about a year of no athletics, I felt fat and weak (that year I gained 30 lbs of mostly fat, bringing me from 147 lbs to 177 lbs), so I wanted to lift more seriously.  Two months before the summer of 2017, I went into the gym with no real program.  I did a weird 3x5 for squat and bench plus ohp, machine rows, curls, and overhead tricep extensions, progressing weight linearly.  My squat is the only lift that made any real progress during this period.  Also, I didn’t actually deadlift at all – my flexibility didn’t let me get into a good position and I never put enough weight on the bar to learn proper form.  I was so scared of rounding my back that I didn’t go anywhere.  However, at the start of summer, my friend prompted me to deadlift and I managed to pick up 225.


In Junior year, I had to drop lifting (again) because of college applications.  Starting in November, I used stress from the college process to help me cut weight, from Nov-Dec I lost 7 pounds, moving from 177lbs to 170lbs.  I think this was mostly fat.


Having finished college applications, I resolved to go back to the gym.  By this point, I had been reading some StrongerByScience articles, so I decided to give Greg Nuckol’s 28 programs a shot.  I continued for 7 weeks, going down to 163lbs.  Then, I started to bulk and deloaded for a week.  I remained on the program for 2 more weeks afterwards, and noticing that my lifts were stalling even though my recovery and fatigue were in check, decided to test my maxes then move onto another program.


That brings us to this week!  I took a really quick deload on Monday, and tested s/b/d today.  I’m super happy about my 3 plate squat.  I thought it would take me at least 3-4 months, and it took me 2.5 months on a (mostly) cut!


#Program Overview


Greg Nuckol’s 28 Programs are a free collection of a-la-carte squat, bench, and deadlift programs.  There are beginner, intermediate, or advanced programs for each lift.  Furthermore, each difficulty has a 1x, 2x, and 3x per week version.  The programs come with a pdf partner, which gives examples about certain program combinations.  Using this partner, I decided on the 3x bench beginner, 3x squat beginner, and 2x deadlift beginner programs.


The program itself uses DUP (daily undulating periodization).  Week-to-week progress is determined by a daily AMRAP set.  The 3x squat and 3x bench beginner programs are actually the exact same.  The deadlift program is different, does not use AMRAPs, and tests a 1RM max every 4-week cycle.


Mondays for squat/bench are 2x8@70%, then AMRAP.  If you get 8 or less reps, weight stays the same for Mondays.  9-10 reps, increase weight by 5 lbs.  11-12 reps, increase weight by 10 lbs.  12+, increase weight by 15lbs


Wednesdays are 2x6@75%, then AMRAP.  Similar AMRAP progression to above, but it starts at 6 reps.
Fridays are 2x4@80%, then AMRAP.  Again, like above, but starting at 4 reps.


Deadlift is hard for me to explain.  Mondays increase linearly (5-10lbs/week), whereas Fridays start with the week 1 Monday weight and add 5-10lbs per set if the previous set was RPE 8 or below.  Mondays use your primary stance, Fridays use your secondary stance.  Every week has more volume than the last, up to the Monday of the 4th week which is a deload, and the 1RM test on Friday.  I believe Greg Nuckols recommends beginners swap primary and secondary stances each cycle.


Accessories are at the lifter’s discretion.


#Nutrition


My diet as a swimmer basically involved eating everything in sight.  If I had to estimate, I think I hit 4000 calories pretty easily.


While on the program January 2018, I ate ~1500 cal/day, eating 200 calories more if I had exercised that day.  During the cut, I don’t think I ate enough protein.  I ate around .6g/lb of bodyweight.  I followed an intermittent fasting protocol.  Normally, I fasted 16 hours, ate a 200-300 calorie lunch (1% milk + chicken breast), then ate a big dinner.  Some weeks, I only ate dinner (fasting for 23 hours?).  


At the beginning of my diet in November 2017, I intended to cut until ~155 lbs, but recognizing my levels of fatigue and weight loss plateau, having cut for ~3 months, I decided to bulk.


Starting my deload at the end of February, I began to eat ~2500 cal/day (likely more, I stopped tracking).  I began to drink protein shakes, each shake containing 60-90g of protein.  I hit 1g protein/lb of bodyweight pretty comfortably.


Right now, I continue to eat 2500cal/day.


#Supplements


I took 10g creatine/day on accident during Jan/Feb, thinking the scoop was 2.5g.  I take 5g/day now.



45 minutes before I work out, I take 6g citrulline malate.  Some days I drank a cup of iced coffee (caffeine content unknown, but it was black).  On the day I tested maxes, I drank 2-3 cups iced coffee 45 minutes before my 1RM max squat.


Since my deload week, I’ve normally consumed 60g of protein powder in a shake, sometimes with a few cups of milk (+16g protein).  Recently, I’ve been mixing orange Gatorade powder in, which has contributed to my carb intake.


#Recovery


My workout sessions last between 1h45m and 2h15m because I rest a lot between sets (3 mins normally).  I don’t mind because the gym is a relaxing place for me.


I sleep a lot.  I go to sleep around 9-9:30PM and wake up around 6:00.  Every Friday, and every other Monday, however, I wake up at 5AM and start lifting at 5:30AM since I can’t go to the gym after school.


I walk 1.5 miles from school to gym, then another 1.5 miles from gym to home at a very leisurely pace.  I think this has helped me with my DOMS.


For my deload week, I cut volume by 50%, replaced the AMRAP with a regular set, and dropped intensity by 5-10%.  I did the same for my accessories.


#Modifications


On the second cycle of deadlifting, I actually cut out the 4th week (maxing week).  That 8th week ended up being my deload week.  After my deload, I restarted from week 1 with heavier weight.  Per Greg Nuckols recommendation, I swapped my primary and secondary stances on the second cycle.  For the first cycle, I did sumo as my primary and conventional as my secondary.  For the second, I did the opposite.


In terms of accessories, I normally do 2-3 accessories after each workout, with low intensity and high reps.  Monday is normally incline bench, flyes, and face pulls.  Wednesday is Pendlay Rows and machine (cable?) lat pulldowns.  Friday is curls and overhead tricep extensions.  I did some pull ups sporadically, but I hate them so I ended up cutting them out.  I tried to add OHP but it was too much fatigue on a cut.


Accessories were chosen based on my aesthetic desires (arm stuff), to improve my main lifts (dumbbell bench and flyes have stopped most of the shaking that I used to have on bench), and perceived weaknesses (back).


While not strictly a modification, I did some basic stretching at night.  I’ve gotten significant improvements in my mobility, notably in my lumbar region and hip flexors.  Swimming made my shoulders pretty mobile, but that’s improved a little as well.


#Thoughts


I really, really liked this program.  I didn’t think I would make this much progress on a cut, and although I was (and still am) a beginner, I don’t think my progress can be entirely chalked up to newbie gains.  I believe the program helped me much more than a basic linear progression program would.


The AMRAP sets taught me a lot about judging RPE and learning where my body would fail.  I think, especially on squats, learning to lift at near-failure significantly improved my technique.  I used to have issues with my feet tilting outwards mid-squat, knee valgus, and some hip shift.  I think those problems are all gone now.  I still have issues with my squat bar path jerking forward on near maximal effort lifts, which I’m going to address in the future.


Testing an AMRAP every day kept me nervous and excited.  It was really cool to see my Friday heavy weight become my Wednesday medium weight, which then became my low-intensity Monday weight.  I learned to accept good days and really bad days and judge my overall fatigue more accurately.  
I also learned that I can’t grind nearly as hard on my bench, which dies pitifully if it stalls halfway up.  I think this means weak anterior delts.


Working at a variety of intensities and rep ranges kept things fresh and gave me good practice.


#Future


Like I mentioned earlier, I decided to test maxes because I could tell progress was stalling even though my fatigue and recovery were in check.  I wanted to get some numbers to plug into another program with more volume to progress further.


Although I’m certain that the intermediate programs are also awesome, I want to explore other programs.  I got the Sheiko app and I’m planning on doing Intermediate Medium load for 3 months.  I think the high volume and low intensity in the first block will help me iron out my form.  Plus, I figure if I’m spending 2 hours in the gym anyways, I might as well do Sheiko.


I’m going to continue my bulk for these 3 months and re-evaluate after the three months.
On an unrelated note, I’m really grateful to this sub for opening my eyes to fantastic lifters and great educational content.  I couldn’t have gotten here without r/weightroom.


**If you’ve read this entire thing, I really appreciate it and I’m super impressed.  Your attention span is significantly longer than mine (as I write this, I have exams tomorrow that I should be studying for).**

7z6pmr,weightroom,"[Meet Report] IPF Serie 1 - Täby AK, Stockholm, Sweden 2018-02-17 | 435kg@71.8kg (959lbs) | 319.8 Wilks | M29 | Raw","Let me begin by confess that this all takes place in the mythical land of Sweden! So please excuse my English.


**Background and Training**

Been lifting weights for about 2 years. 29 years old this year and father of two. I'm 174 cm or 5'8 (and a half!) in freedom units. Usually weigh around 74kg/163lbs.
I have two meets behind me from last year. Both ended with a 400kg total. Nothing special, but got the feel for competing.

My PRs before the meet:

Squat: 150 kg in training and 140 in a meet

Bench: 115 kg in training and 100 kg in a meet (The 115 was with a lifted ass and touch n go )

Deadlift: 172.5 kg in training and 170 in a meet

About 8 weeks ago I decided to start GZCL Jacked and Tanned  2.0. Now, this wasn't the best timing since I knew this meet was coming up. So I ended up running 4 weeks of JnT and then switched over to some higher intensity work to prepare for the meet.

**Meet Prep**

As stated above, I switched from JnTs high volume training to some high intensity work the weeks leading up to the meet.
My two main concerns going in to the meet was my squats in training had not always been hitting below parallel. Close but not quite. And while benching I had the nasty habit of lifting my ass from the leg drive.

Now, in this mythical land of Sweden we have four main competitions each year where we compete for our powerlifting club/gym . These are called Serie 1, Serie 2 etc. In these meets only your wilks score counts towards your club score so what you weigh that day doesn't really matter. That said, if you want to personally qualify for Nationals or any other big meet, you qualify with your total in the weight class you weigh in at. Makes sense? Otherwise ask me to clarify! 
Since I knew I wouldn't be near any total to qualify to anything, I didn't put too much thought in dieting for this meet. That said I weighed in a lot lower than I thought at 71.8 kg. Weigh-ins were about two-three hours before first squat. 

**The Lifts**

Excuse my lack of videos, I only have one from my final squat.
I went 7/9, missing my final bench and deadlift.

**Squat**

140KG, ⚪⚪⚪ Good lift: Previous meet PR from a year ago. Worried about depth coming in to the meet but hit depth and got 3 white lights.

150KG, ⚪⚪🔴 Good lift: Previous training PR. Heavy but felt I had a little left in the tank. Depth was just enough to at least give me two whites. 

155KG, ⚪⚪⚪ Good lift: Damn what a grinder. I bet the judges had time to go get a coffee before I got up from the bottom. Three white lights!
[Video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/qUTNbS6gIk2U4K952)

**Bench**

100KG, ⚪⚪⚪ Good lift:Wanted an easy lift I knew I could do without lifting my ass.  Three white lights. Also noted that the head judge were quick with the press signal as soon as the bar touched the chest.

110KG, ⚪⚪⚪ Good lift: A bit worried about lifting my ass so I didn't push the leg drive that much. Caused the lift to feel heavier than it should have been, but I got it up. 

112.5KG, 🔴🔴🔴 No lift: I felt that I had it in me, but that damn ass decided to take an elevator up from the bench. As soon as I felt my ass lift I stopped pressing since I knew it was a no lift.

**Deadlift**

*Note: I pull conventional.*

160KG, ⚪⚪⚪ Good lift: Heavy, but what deadlift isn't? Three white lights

170KG, ⚪⚪⚪ Good lift: Previous meet PR. Still heavy, but doable. 

180KG, 🔴🔴🔴 No lift: Utter fail. Was to brave when raising the weight and started lifting with horrible form. Grinded it up t my knees before failing.

**Results**

Total at 435 kg at 71.8 puts me at 319.8 wilks.
My next goal is to break the 1000lbs barrier at 453,6 KG. My next meet will be in May in the next series of our competition called Serie 2. 
I might be able to push my squat to 157.5 or 160 depending on training and diet. 115 in bench shouldn't be a problem as long as I can keep working on keeping my as glued to the bench. Deadlift, well… I haven't improved much in almost 10 monthes…

… So two days after the meet I decided to start playing around with sumo! Which I haven't done since I started lifting about two years ago. I stopped then since my hip mobility didn't play nice with sumo, but two years later and I'm more mobile than ever. So ofcourse I pulled a 175 kg PR deadlift without pretty much touching sumo before.

7k052m,weightroom,"[Meet Report] RPS Winter's Wrath 2017 - Lebanon, NH, USA (492.1kg @ 88.1 kg | 318 Wilks","**Background and Training**

This was my first meet. I'm 32M and I've been lifting on-and-off for about 3-4 years, including some SS/SL at the beginning. The last 1.5 years has been more consistent. Got back into lifting running GSLP into GZCLP, and then have just done a bunch of GZCL from there. Couple cycles of Rippler, an extended 18-week JnT2 (repeat first 6-week cycle twice), bit of Bench Press / Deadlift Wave Forms, before I sprained a lat pretty bad, again, so changed gears and ran VDIP for a long while, cutting down from 210 lbs to about 198.

I've been dealing with some pain in my right MCL, so did a lot more SSB Squats in VDIP, eventually doing with reduced ROM to a box, which didn't hurt. I did a ton of back work throughout the year, basically some kind of pulldown/row/chin-up 4 days a week, sometimes multiple back exercises on a day. I introduced back extensions (on incline bench), and did a bunch of SSB good mornings, too. I figured if my knee/leg had issues, may as well just double-down on back. I think this payed off in the end.

My best lifts before meet prep were done at end of JnT2:

* 395 lb ""sort-of HB"" Squat, pretty grindy
* 240 lb ""basically touch-and-go"" Bench Press (looking back, my ass probably shot off the bench a bit)
* 455 lb Sumo Deadlift (I swapped to sumo half-way through JnT2 because I sprained my back)
* 1090 lb ""gym total"" at ~205 lbs

I did mostly deficit conventional deads in VDIP, and tested my 1RM conventional before dipping into UHF. I hit 455 lbs conventional at 198 lbs, with 465 coming up about an inch.

_Diet_

I track my macros in MyFitnessPal. I aimed for about 150-200g protein, ~100g fat, 100-150g carbs. I manipulated my fat and carbs to hit calorie goals whether bulking or leaning out or maintenance. Generally avoid bread, pasta, sweets, sugar. Lots of BBQ during this year. Tons of coffee, like 1-1.5 pots per day. Beer 1-3 times a week, fitting in my calories.

I took about 5g of creatine and 10000 IU vitamin D per day. Cheap, easy, effective.

_Sleep and Recovery_

I got this pretty under wraps. Most days, I get 8-10 hours of sleep. I use Luna (melatonin and stuff), works for me. Do the occasional epsom salt bath, and I try to get in as much walking as possible, often doing multiple 2 mile walks on weekend days (often to the BBQ place near me).

**Meet Prep**

I came out of VDIP and ran UHF9 with peak into the meet, which is actually a 12-week program (I did about 11.5 weeks into meet). I was at my target weight, hovering around 198-200 lbs, so I just ate for maintenance, which was about 2600-3000 kCals per day (I ate back calories from exercise).

I set my TM to 315 Squat, 215 Bench, 420 Sumo Deadlift. Due to AMRAPs, I bumped DL TM to 425 in second meso. I really struggled with bench throughout, missing a lot of AMRAPs at 210. Eventually for third meso I lowered my TM to 210.

_Squat_

I went with a conservative squat TM because of the MCL nonsense I was dealing with. I found using flat shoes (chucks) instead of squat shoes seemed to not aggravate so much, so switched to that, made my stance a little bit wider, and did most sets with a hip circle right below my knees, which helped me focus on pushing my knees out (video-ing myself, I saw a tendency to collapse as fatigue set in).

_Bench_

Bench was kind of a crap shoot. I think I just missed too many reps in training, and probably should have set my TM lower. I don't know. Especially with what happened at the meet, I think I need to focus on not shooting my butt off the bench, and maybe have some more specificity for a bit at some point, instead of all the variation that a lot of GZCL programming has. Not be so focused on attacking weakpoints, because it's just weak, period. I will ponder more on this and hopefully 2018 will see some bench gains.

_Deadlift_

I felt my sumo deadlift had a lot of potential, so went with sumo instead of conventional. I programmed it differently than conventional from UHF9. For T1, I just used same percentages, sets, and reps as T1 squat. I kept the paused conventional deadlifts for T2 in the first meso, but went to 3"" block sumo deadlifts for the remainder, using same percentages, sets, and reps like a T2 squat off my deadlift TM, with added 10%. I hit tons of AMRAP PRs, with lots of estimated 1RM hovering around ~500 lbs. Deadlift went great on this cycle.

A lot of my back work, and deadlifts over 2 reps, I basically use straps. So I was a bit concerned about grip strength for the meet. I added double-overhand rack holds after T1 deadlifts, and I think these definitely helped. Basically strip set of 315, 225, 135 lbs, holding each for as long as possible (no hook grip). I think this ended up working for me, and will continue with this strategy in the future (mostly straps off-season, get grip back up-to-par for a meet).

The last 1.5 weeks was a taper. I used the strategy from the UHF9 spreadsheet. Lots of singles and specificity.

_Water Cut_

I decided to do a very simple water cut, just to make sure I hit the 198 lb mark, since some days I hovered up to 200. I cut my creatine out about 1 week before the meet, and started drinking 2 gallons of water a day. The day before weigh ins, I stopped eating at noon, mostly fat and high-density calories, and only had a bit under 1 gallon of water. The meet allowed 24 hour weigh-in, so I did that, and weighed in at 194.2, way under the 198 mark. Then I ate a bunch and drank water like usual.

**The Lifts**

I chose my openers as something I hit for 5 in the training cycle. I was pretty anxious and just didn't want to bomb out. After that, I took jumps based on how the previous one felt. I ended up being pretty conservative with bench, since I had to re-take my opener. Since this is my first meet, I wanted to get on the board and give me something to beat in the future.

I went 7/9. No videos, I went to the meet by myself, so the results page below is all the proof I have! /shrug

_Squat_

This was my first time lifting in a monolift, and I liked it. I could have used wraps in this class (Raw Modern), but I train with sleeves and don't have a crew to wrap me anyway, so I just did sleeves.

* 161.0 kg (355 lbs), 3/3: Easy opener, have hit this for 5 during training cycle.
* 174.6 kg (385 lbs), 3/3: A bit slower, but solid. Haven't done this weight in a while.
* 181.4 kg (400 lbs), 0/3: Felt good, got a bounce, stuck in middle and missed. Would have been a +5 lb PR.

_Bench_

* 88.5 kg (195 lbs), 0/3: Easy, but my ass shot up off bench big time. No lift.
* 88.5 kg (195 lbs), 3/3: Kept my butt down, easy rep, have done for 5 in training cycle.
* 95.3 kg (210 lbs), 3/3: About 8-8.5RPE, easy, have hit for double quite a few times in training cycle.

_Deadlift_

Going into deadlifts, I was super psyched up. The atmosphere was awesome, we were all pumped, cheering each other on, and the crowd was great. Knew opener would be easy, then I'd officially have a total, so could play. This was my first time lifting with a deadlift bar, and I think it helped me not be limited by grip.

* 192.8 kg (425 lbs), 3/3: Flew up. Super easy. Have hit for 5 in training cycle.
* 208.7 kg (460 lbs), 3/3: Pretty fast and easy. This was +5 lbs PR.
* 222.3 kg (490 lbs), 3/3: Only slight grind at lockout. Huge +35 lbs PR for me! Super happy!

**Results**

I hit my goal of ""not bombing out"". Ended up 3rd out of 3 with 492.1 kg (1085 lbs) total in the 198 lb Raw Modern (sleeves or wraps) Amateur Open division. 318 Wilks, which is about 7 Wilks higher than best gym total (1090 lbs at 205 lbs). Incredibly psyched about my deadlift PR.

**Final thoughts**

Really had a great time. Definitely will be seeking out meets run by James and Meghan Matta in the future and plan to compete again 1-2 times next year. Will do next year's Winter's Wrath for sure, possibly a meet in summer, too.

Right now, I'm about a week into RP Diet Fat Loss phase and running Prep and Fat Loss out of 5/3/1 Forever. Aiming to get within range of 181 lbs class, maybe. Mostly trying to lean out so that when I do gain weight, it'll be more muscle. Haven't had it measured, just pictures, I'm around 20% body fat, for sure, which is non-ideal for putting on muscle.

7hpsuj,weightroom,"[Mini Meet Report] Tropikal Barbell Deadlift Only, Brunei (205kg @78.2kg) | 142 Wilks, 23yrs)","Just a small fun meet hosted on the 3rd of December. Powerlifting is just getting started in Brunei and to participate in a full meet you’d have to travel internationally to Malaysia or Singapore. We had roughly 20 lifters.

**Background**

I began lifting a year and a half ago by learning from youtube videos. Before that I wasn’t particularly active, maybe a game of ultimate Frisbee once a week. This was my first/closest experience of what it would be like to lift under meet conditions. 

Coming into this meet I was running Block A of Adam Ramzy’s Raw Powerlifting program taken from MyStrengthBook.com which was typically many sets of 3-8 reps at around 60-70% of my max. I was in a caloric surplus and getting 6-7 hours of sleep, so recovery was great in the week before. Prior to this, I ran close to half a year’s worth of 5/3/1 anchor and leader cycles, trying for AMRAPs at 75-85 of my max 3 times a week. This took my deadlift 1rm from 170kg in March to 200kg in September. Honestly, none of this was probably particularly ideal for peaking into a meet, but I’m glad I’d switched and wasn’t doing AMRAPs leading up into the meet.

**Meet Day**

I was pretty nervous coming into this meet for one or two reasons. I could count on one hand the number of times I’ve hit a heavy single on the deadlift. Additionally, mixed grip had been giving me a lot of trouble with the bar listing off to one side, so I’d made the swap to using hookgrip a week and a half ago. Hookgrip lets me just pull without having to think too much. The only “problem” being that I have tiny hands, and so I currently pull with 1.5 fingers over the thumb. Seriously, I work with a lot of 10-12 year old kids, and an easy way to break the ice has always been to point out that our hands are the same size. At that point the most I’d pulled with hook had been 150kg so I didn’t know if my thumbs would stay or slip. 

So, the plan was to go easy and hit my previous max of 200kg quick and easy, as it was [utter trash](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZ52pvHBZDe/) the first time I attempted it. 

A lot of people did water cuts and 24hr fasts leading into the meet. I woke up and automatically chugged a litre of water and went through a couple slices of toast before remembering that I had to weigh in. I was a kilo heavier but since the meet was so small we ranked by wilks and I didn’t have to worry about hitting a weight class. I took 300mg of caffeine and topped up on coffee throughout.

**Deadlifts**

[Attempt 1 – 180kg – Make](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcTzGzlBCaf/)

An easy weight. I was letting a more experienced friend of mine structure my warm-ups and suggest numbers, so we decided to go to 195 based off how quick this was. Somebody told me I had nice shorts.

[Attempt 2 – 195kg – Make](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcTzoqnhIhM/)

Felt a lot more difficult, started to feel the bar come away from me as I lifted. I got the advice to be patient off the floor for my 3rd. Things didn’t look as pants shittingly bad as my gym 200, and I was getting hyped as fuck, so friendo chose 205 for me.

[Attempt 3 – 205kg – Make](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcT4sDBBzmJ/)

Took it much slower off the floor here and it paid off. I think the 205kg call was spot on given my experience with max singles. Right at the top I could feel the thumb slipping out, but held on long enough for the down command.

**Summary**

3/3 for my lifts for a 142 wilks placing me 6th in my flight (the second and heavier of two flights).
It felt pretty good to have pushed past my goal 200kg with a week and a half old grip to boot. Shaving my calluses and taping the shit out of my thumbs with crazy sticky tape helped tons, especially since the bars had no knurling whatsoever. 

Even though this was a [very](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcUkac9BnJ4/) [informal](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcUkglhhyqj/?taken-by=jnlmtl) meet, it convinced me that I want to do more in the future, and that I’d like to eventually compete in an affiliated meet. The meet atmosphere was insane, with everybody being incredibly supportive of each other. 

Before that, I'd like to get a lot of work in with singles and triples to get the skill right. I'm also going to keep working with my patience off the floor, seeing the difference it made today. Hoping for 230++ at the end of next year. Hoping to also remember not to chug water before weigh in.

[Great experience.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcRsdszhD09/)

7hj07c,weightroom,[Meet Report] USAPL New Jersey Collegiate Invitational| 365kg @ 63.5kg | 296.05 Wilks | Jr.,"**Background and Training**

I've been lifting on and off for the past two years or so but due to program hopping, losing motivation, and various nagging injuries, I haven't really made any significant progress. For this reason, I decided that I'd join my college powerlifting team (Rutgers University) my senior year in hopes of training with like-minded people and learning from others. Before college, I was a pretty competitive runner in track and cross country so it is definitely nice to have some of that team camaraderie again.

In regards to my past training, I've always been a big proponent of the GZCL method; the tiered structure always appealed to me and I've run various programs ranging from GZCLP to my own custom 4 week templates. I've also run Candito's 6 Week program, where I saw pretty great gains in both my squat and deadlift.

**Meet Prep**

Before going into this meet prep, I was dealing with a bit of tricep/elbow pain due to a bit of tendonitis. I took a break from benching for about 5 weeks and pretty much lost all of my bench strength starting this prep. Conversely, my squat and deadlift were both feeling pretty strong after just coming off of Candito's 6 Week.

Here are my training PRs before the prep: 250x4/150x1/315x1 (w/ straps)

I decided to pull the trigger and hire a coach to take care of my programming and keep me accountable; I ended up being directed to Dallas Bey, a fellow student who happens to be one of the top junior lifters in the country and incredibly knowledgeable resource. For a very reasonable price, we discussed what I was looking for in a coach, what my training goals were, and how to best get there. By the time I actually hired Dallas and got my programming underway, I was 7 weeks out.

My programming consisted of 4 training days a week with 4x bench, 3x squat, and 1x deadlift. Everything was RPE based and it was definitely a bit of a struggle getting used to autoregulation. Accessory work was pretty minimal for the most part but there was a good amount of core and stability work that I think helped me a lot with bracing during heavy lifts. I also enjoyed the idea of doing some type of back work everyday since I was comfortable with that after my time with GZCL. 

As with most meet preps, the intensity and specificity went up as we approached meet day and it sometimes was a bit hard to recover, especially since I tend to overshoot RPE at times. External factors such as high stress due to a difficult courseload, long hours at my on-campus job, and noisy housemates that party at all types of odd hours definitely added up and took a toll on my mental state and fatigue levels. Luckily, my taper week right before the meet was mostly stress free and I was able to brush off a good chunk of that accumulated fatigue before going into the meet.

**Meet Day**

Weight has never been as issue as I've always been a pretty scrawny kid since my cross country days; throughout my prep I weighed in the low 140s and meet day was no exception (63.5kg). I got a good night's sleep and woke up nice and early to go through equipment check and weigh-ins. Meet day nutrition consisted of apples, pretzels, honey on toast, and sourpatch kids. Coffee is my usual preworkout so I had it right before I started warming up for squats.

This meet was HECTIC to say the least. There were two platforms with 3-4 flights each and the warmup room was packed. The venue was a Crossfit Gym which was sizeable and open but I didn't like that the bars and bumper plates were so radically different from the competition equipment. Wait times between warmup sets was longer than I anticipated, which made me jump up a bit higher in weight between sets than I would have liked.

The goal for the meet was to atleast qualify for Collegiate Nationals, which requires a 365kg (~805lbs) total at my weight class. The secondary goal was to get a 300 Wilks my first meet, which would have required a 375kg (~825lbs) total at 63.5 kg.

*Just a heads up: I don't have any videos of my lifts because unfortunately the recordings came out super blurry*

**Squat**

My favorite lift and honestly the one that I think is the most technically proficient. I was really feeling good today and was hoping for some big numbers. Training PR was 295@8.5-9 RPE.

* 1st Attempt: 125kg (275.62lbs) - Absolutely smoked this. Though the bar felt really heavy and dense on my back, this is a weight I am super comfortable with, having hit it at RPE 6.5-7 in training. [3 Whites]
* 2nd Attempt: 132.5kg (292.16lbs) - This felt much easier than expected, especially with all the adrenaline that was running through me. Hit my sticking point a little bit but it flew up. However, I rushed the rack command. [3 Reds]
* 3rd Attempt: 132.5kg (292.16lbs) - We decided to repeat the same weight, much to my chagrin, because it wasn't worth the risk of failing the attempt and having 125kg be my top attempt. The weight was a bit of a grinder but I got it. Probably had another 2.5-5kg in me but I'm happy with the decision. [3 Whites]

**Bench**

My worst and least favorite lift for sure. My elbows were feeling a little janky this day but after some warmups it felt a lot better. My biggest problem here is consistency. Training PR was 165@8.5 RPE

* 1st Attempt: 70kg (154.53lbs) - Easy peasy. Press command came sooner than expected and the weight flew up. [3 Whites]
* 2nd Attempt: 75kg (165.37lbs) - Misgrooved a little and touched a bit lower than I usually do, which make the initial press off the chest a bit more difficult than expected. Weight still flew up pretty easy (8-8.5 RPE). [3 Whites]
* 3rd Attempt: 77.5kg (170.88lbs) - We decided to be a bit more conservative and go for a 2.5kg jump, even though things were moving well. However, it just didn't move once it got off my chest. Strength was there but I don't think I was tight enough [3 Reds]

**Deadlift**

At this point the adrenaline had worn off and I was pretty exhausted. Deadlifts have been a bit finicky of a lift and I've always been scared to push them since my low back feels a bit vulnerable. Warmups felt meh and I wasn't sure how my attempts would go. Training PR was 340@9 RPE.

* 145kg (319.72lbs) - Easiest rep of the day outside of 135 during warmups. The weight felt effortless. [3 Whites]
* 152.5kg (336.26lbs) - Another pretty easy rep here. My form started to break down just a little but I knew I had a lot more in me this day [3 Whites]
* 157.5kg (347.28lbs) - A part of me wanted to go up in weight here since I knew that I had more in me but the goal for today was to qualify for Collegiate Nationals and 157.5kg was the way to get there. Once again, the weight moved up really smooth, although lockout was a little slower than the previous attempts [3 Whites]

**Results**

7/9 - 132.5/75/157.5 for a total of 365kg to qualify me for Collegiate Nationals. 
The rest of the 66kg weight class was incredibly stacked with a fellow RUPL member nearly missing a 237.5kg pull. I don't remember my exact placing (I'll update this when its up) but I believe I was 7th out of 12.

**Final Thoughts**

This experience was a blast and a learning opportunity for sure. Having a goal in mind and training towards it has entirely changed the way I look at training. While I wish I could go back and be patient on that 2nd squat or tried to curb some of the external variables that got in the way of my meet prep, I can't say I'd really want to change the results of this meet. If anything, this has made me even hungrier to improve myself as a person and as a lifter and I know that come next semester, I'm going to absolutely crush these numbers and easily obtain >300 Wilks.

Moving on from here, I'm going to take a bit time off from structured training. As much as I enjoyed meet prep, it started to feel like a job towards the latter weeks and I want to be able to bullshit and do whatever I want for a little before I get back at it. I'm going to play around with low bar and sumo and see which styles I like the best. I know that my bench has a long way to go but I think this high frequency approach has done a lot to ingrain the motor pattern while also accumulating a lot of volume. I was never super interested in powerlifting but I think that my views have changed dramatically over these past 8 or so weeks. I do wish I joined the team earlier but I know that the current members, along with our new coach Chris Aydin from TSA, will take this club team to new heights in the near future. Look out for some big numbers from me next meet!

TLDR: Went from 250x4/150x1/315x1 to 292x1/165x1/347x1 in 7 weeks thanks to proper coaching

7ao1si,weightroom,"[Meet report] IPL World Championship - Las Vegas, NV, USA (USPA elite total 337.5kg@59.7kg) | 377.73 | Female raw open","The good:

* I did IPL Worlds!!!
* Hit meet PRs on squat and bench
* Finally hit a 2x competition bodyweight squat in a meet
* Training was on point and peaking was flawless; got so much stronger leading up to this competition and learned a lot
* Got a USPA elite total again and a tiny Wilks PR due to lower body weight
* Got to do an entire meet of just high-level female lifters, how cool is that?!?!
* Picked perfect openers; usually I pick too low which makes it difficult to select a good second attempt
* First meet where I took risks and didn’t sandbag; now I know how it feels to overshoot as well as undershoot so I can aim for something in the middle

The bad:

* Went 5/9
* Was affected pretty badly by the weight cut (63.5 -> 59.7)
* Over-tapered (partially due to weight cut)
* Only tied my last total (deadlift was a shitshow)
* Underperformed in the meet relative to training
* Picked bad second attempts on squat and deadlift (too low on squat, too high on dead)

**Training up to the meet:** This is covered in ludicrous detail in my [Stronger by Science 28 programs review](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/78sr3w/program_review_stronger_by_science_28_programs/). 7.5 weeks out from the meet (the .5 is because weigh-ins were on a Wednesday) I needed to come up with some kind of 6-week peak with a week of tapering. I couldn’t figure out how to deal with this mid-week thing so I figured I’d cross that bridge when I got to it. I really liked the squat programming from [Candito 6-week](http://www.powerliftingtowin.com/candito-6-week-strength-program/) so I decided to use that. The optional accessories I chose were leg press and barbell hip thrusts. I was halfway through my second cycle of the Stronger by Science 3x/week advanced bench program so that was perfect too because 1.5 cycles gives me 6 weeks with a max test on week 6. I didn't really want to do Candito deadlift so I ended up bastardizing the strength + peaking blocks of deadlift only from the Fuerza powerlifting program. Technically that is 8 weeks (3 weeks work + 1 week deload for each block) but I skipped the first deload which again, put me at a perfect 6 weeks of work + 1 week of deload.

**PRs leading up to competition:** The week before taper, I did a [mock meet for squats](https://youtu.be/LMFMtdNqtQM). I did my planned attempts of 248, 265, 275 and then hit a yolo PR of 280. The first and second moved so stupidly smooth that I figured I should bump them both up by 2.5 kilos for the meet. I had an RPE 9.5 deadlift programmed and I [pulled 345](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pi7EzzDWaE) like a hot knife through butter. Testing bench attempts was OK but acceptable; 143 was easy, 147 required some work, and I failed on a paused 155. I’ve hit 155 paused this training cycle but since then I hurt my shoulder and started tucking my elbows which makes me weaker than flaring.

**Weight cut:** I successfully cut about 6% of my body weight for this meet, and didn’t have to sweat in order to do it. However, I think I executed my weight cut *too* perfectly in the sense that I depleted a lot and as a consequence wasn’t able to really recover.

I cut creatine two weeks out and cut carbs a week out. For some reason, keto affected me really badly. I decided to take some additional heavy squats maybe 2 days after starting keto to test my new planned 1st and 2nd attempts of 255 and 270. [270 was grindy](https://youtu.be/ZUgZHG-i12Q) in a way that didn’t make much sense after my mock meet but I decided not to really think about it.

A week out I started sodium and water loading. If you’re not familiar with this, the idea is you load up on lots of sodium and water, then cut sodium 48 hours out, and cut water about 15 hours out. Your body gets used to peeing a ton and clearing out sodium so when you cut it all of a sudden you pee like crazy. This may or may not be broscience but it works. Last time I cut weight I felt like I fucked up this part and didn't get nearly enough extra sodium; this time I didn’t and like I said it might’ve been to my detriment (more on this in a bit). I was drinking 2 gallons of water a day and I’d empty an entire bottle of Mio Electrolytes into each gallon.

3 days out I switched to low-volume low-fiber foods to get rid of gut content. I’d put tons of heavy whipping cream in my coffee and scramble eggs in lots of butter, stuff like that to get lots of low-volume calories. I actually think that this is a pretty good way to cut weight if you’re a few pounds over because gut content doesn’t actually help your performance. I also took a laxative about 20 hours out.

**Weigh-ins/rehydration:** I woke up at 59.5 on my scale and my official weight was 59.7. I drank a liter of Pedialyte every hour for four hours to compensate for the fluids I cut. The first Pedialyte was mixed with 10g creatine that I brought in a [supplement funnel](http://a.co/cvNeEGG). I ate a bunch of food, especially salty carby stuff, but didn’t over-stuff myself. The next day I woke up having regained most of the weight I cut which was awesome. However I was still craving salt like crazy.

Bonus funny story: Another lady at weigh-ins came in over and I told her, ""Well, I didn't use any of my weight cutting stuff so I have my sauna suit and Albolene and everything if you want to cut in my hotel room"", so I let her and her husband have my bathroom/bathtub so she could sweat off the extra. They definitely thought it was a weird offer (as it was) but took me up on it anyway :D

**Competition:** Without being a smart biology-type, this is what I think happened: I don’t think my body had stopped clearing sodium as a consequence of loading. I was still having signs of electrolyte depletion, including insane thirst and parched dry mouth no matter how much water I drank. I had an insatiable craving for salt but no matter how much I consumed I couldn't get enough. In particular I felt like my quads were affected; I just couldn’t get my quads to fire. I felt generally strong otherwise and I still put up a USPA elite total but I underperformed as compared to training.

All links are to timestamps in the recorded livestream.

Squat 1: [115 kgs/254 lbs](https://youtu.be/sKinO5_T7OE?t=30m3s). Three whites.

My husband always calls my second and third attempts. However, he didn’t know where he had to be to call attempt 2 so for this one I had to give them something.myself. I panicked and said 120, it should have been 122.5 but I wasn’t thinking about having to call my second so I was put on the spot. He called my other attempts though.

Squat 2: [120 kgs/264 lbs](https://youtu.be/sKinO5_T7OE?t=44m36s). Three whites. 10 lb meet PR and double competition bodyweight.

Squat 3: [127.5 kgs/281 lbs](https://youtu.be/sKinO5_T7OE?t=59m26s). Like I said my quads weren't firing properly so I couldn't grind through the sticking point. Shot my hips up to shift the load and pitched forward, spotters caught the bar.

I'm actually happy with how bench went, despite not matching my gym PR. Bench is the one lift I kind of expect to go better in the gym due to long meet pauses.

Bench 1: [65 kgs/143 lbs](https://youtu.be/sKinO5_T7OE?t=2h40m9s). Easy opener and already a 5 lb meet PR.

Bench 2: [67.5 kgs/147 lbs](https://youtu.be/sKinO5_T7OE?t=2h54m36s). Good lift though it felt hard. Husband wanted me to do a higher second attempt but I absolutely said no on 10 lb bench jumps.

Bench 3: [70 kgs/154 lbs](https://youtu.be/sKinO5_T7OE?t=3h6m55s). Gave it my all but missed.

Deadlift 1: [150 kgs/330 lbs](https://youtu.be/sKinO5_T7OE?t=4h56m43s). Three whites but it felt way harder than it should have considering that I have [easily tripled 325](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXlH2WDjT9J/). I was going to open with 147.5 but husband raised it so that I'd at least match my previous meet total with my first attempt.

Deadlift 2: Shitshow. [160 kgs/352 lbs](https://youtu.be/sKinO5_T7OE?t=5h7m59s). Same as my last meet PR and I missed it off the floor. Makes no damn sense as I'm strong af off the floor. If you look at the training video I linked of me easily pulling 345 that's only 7 lbs less and not on a deadlift bar. I even pulled 360 in training with a hitch. Like I said my quads just weren't firing and I use lots of leg drive to break the bar off the floor so that's really my only explanation.

[I attempted it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKinO5_T7OE&feature=youtu.be&t=5h17m23s) for my third, got it up an inch, and failed.

**What's next?** If you've followed my posts in the daily thread, you know that I realized fairly early on in this training cycle that 60 kg is too small for me and that I've been planning to move up to 67.5. Obviously this solidified my decision. In order to keep my weight within cutting distance of 60 I had to struggle and sacrifice and constantly under-recover. I didn’t even anticipate that I’d underperform at worlds when I made that decision.

I’m NOT talking about “letting myself go”. I like being lean and athletic, I still plan to meal prep, I and I like eating healthy food. But maintaining my present size has meant weighing out my grams of oatmeal and chicken breast, bringing my tupperwares of food everywhere even if my friends are eating pizza, and frequently going to bed with my stomach growling. I am just too old for this shit; I got off on this kind of neurosis when I was younger but that’s no longer where I am. I’ve also sacrificed muscle gain, and in particular I believe that I need more upper body mass to keep up with the big benchers. I’ve been ignoring my body’s hunger signals. I’m not talking the kind of hunger where you second-guess and ask yourself, “Am I *really* hungry or am I just bored or stressed?”. I’m talking about that searing hunger after lifting where your muscles are screaming FEED ME GODDAMNIT I AM TRYING TO HEAL AND GROW.

At the same time, I’m not willing to stuff myself beyond satiety and I want to be guided by my hunger cues rather than My Fitness Pal macros or RP spreadsheets. I don’t want to bulk to where I don’t like my body and I don’t want to accelerate the process of getting huge just to fill out a weight class. I don’t want to stop doing cardio and conditioning just to make bulking easier because I like being healthy and in shape.

My plan is to continue with meal prep, eat bodybuilding-type foods (veggies, lean protein, whole grains, our lord and savior Halo Top, y’all know the deal) but eat until I’m full and not weight and measure everything, sticking to one drink per week and 1-2 cheat meals a week. And I just want to let my body be where it wants to be. I know that I won’t go off the rails because that’s just not my style. If I lose my abs at any point I’ll probably do a small cut but not target a particular weight class.

I plan to do three months of hypertrophy next to stave off injury, give my body a break from the heaviness and repetition of peaking, and put on some much needed muscle mass. For this I signed up for the [Jacked Street](http://powerathletehq.com/jackedstreet/) programming. It looks super fun though the volume is no joke. I have no doubt that my body will tell me to eat ;) Then I will probably do the 12-week powerlifting program from Fuerza. If I decide to do a cut after Jacked Street it will be during the first four weeks of the Fuerza program.

Vanity-wise, I want a pec split and I want to bring up my hamstrings. I'm pretty self-conscious about the backs of my legs :-\

bb9l59,longevity,Database of Early Adopters,"It is my opinion that the first actual proof that we have reached functional regenerative therapies won't be research papers. Because these take years to be publish, they usually only address one very specific aspect of aging and are very rarely definitive (one paper alone rarely proves anything, only a constellation of evidence usually lead to a real consensus).

My opinion is that the first evidence will come from the rich and famous who are involved in the field. Theyl be the first to have access to the experimental stuff that actually does work and so what we will see is that they will stop dying. To that end I have been collecting information on this type of individual to try to detect that signal. I wanted to see if this community could help me complete the list below:

6jncuf,longevity,"""Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken."" - Warren Buffett","Epictetus told us that **Men are disturbed not by things themselves** but **the view which they take of them**.

Our identities and the way we constantly re-frame ourselves essentially shapes our behaviour and experiences.

People often underestimate the way words directly impact actions. 

**Bad habits weigh us down on our journey to moral excellence**; like an anchor, they can pull us back. It's our job to untie each anchor one at a time in order to quicken our assent. 

This identity is described in the sense that “my name is John and I drink coffee often” or “I smoke cigarettes every day.” 

A study published in the *Journal of Consumer Research* tested the way people used words and how the way they used them made a difference to resisting the temptation of a bad habit.

There were two groups in the study, the first let’s call then group 1 were instructed to use the phrase “I can’t”. Group 2 were instructed to use the phrase **“I don’t”** both in response to a temptation of unhealthy food options. 

As the study ended both group 1 and 2 were offered two options. The first was a granola bar (acting as the “healthy” option), while the second was offered a chocolate bar (acting as the “unhealthy” option). 

The researchers were then measuring whether their new founded “identity” would have any significant effect on whether they would choose the relatively healthy choice or the unhealthy one. 

39 % of people who used the phrase “I can’t” picked the granola (healthy) option while 64% of the “I don’t” (group 2) chose the healthy option over the unhealthy one. 

The idea is then that **one gains greater “psychological empowerment” when phrases used in order to resist a temptation come together to form a new identity.**

We can see this identity formation in action with diets. A vegetarian may find themselves consistent, disciplined and healthier as they follow their diet, same with ketogenic diets, vegan diets. 

#Decision fatigue

We like to have rules which we can follow, they serve us better long-term rather than “eating healthier”.

Veganism in itself involves many ethical arguments and forms a very strong identity, you see many vegans who explicitly date other vegans (there’s nothing wrong with this, I’m simply proving a point).

Some people may have had difficulty in following a “healthy diet” and vegetarianism, Atkins, etc…come to save the day. 

**Choosing an identity leads to less decision fatigue.**

In studies (as seen below) they have looked at judges and observed that as the day progresses, judges seem to lose their ability to make consistent rationally grounded decisions hence “decision fatigue” (1).

There’s less decision in the moment of “should I eat that” if your deontology allows you too. 

This means less decision fatigue and more willpower, especially in the case of vegans “more extreme” which can hold a high emotional investment into the “cause”. 

>“The soul, like the body, accepts by practice whatever habit one wishes it to contact.”
- Socrates

#Don’t count days. 

Another idea which can help in forming this identity is to stop “counting days” this is a similar strategy as saying I can’t. 

**NEVER count days.** Now you may disagree, but if you are counting days you are still staying in the same identity, every day you count you are a ""smoker who went 40 days without it"" or a gamer who went 24 days without gaming”

**Every habit is triggered by some event.** For me, I would smoke after stress, eating, drinking coffee, a meeting, drinking alcohol, or being around other smokers. 

I found this out by carrying around a notebook and pencil and making a tally mark in the notebook each time I smoked, for a couple of days. 

Then I wrote down the triggers in the notebook for a day or two — if I smoked, I’d look at what happened just before the urge to smoke. 

This helped me to be more aware of the triggers, some of which you don’t realise you have.

The point is that we are always striving to eliminate them, one at a time.
