1mtrutt,Smoothies,Well rounded smoothie for someone who cant eat solid food.,"Hello!

My dad has late stage Parkinson's and can no longer eat solid food.  His retirement home has been making him pureed meals, but needless to say he is getting sick of that so I wanted to turn him on to smoothies.  The other caveat is he cant really eat any fruit as it irritates is throat.

Was looking for creative suggestions of smoothies that are tasty, satiating, and provide protein and fiber for him.

The first one i'm going to try with him will have oats, milk, protein powder and maybe a small amount of soaked chia to see if he can stomach them.  What else am I missing? Also since he's older and deserves to live a little he isn't afraid of adding things like ice cream.

Also is there any way to include certain ingredients that would help them stay in the fridge or freezer if he cant finish them?

A couple of weeks ago I ran a survey here about your wellness goals, favorite flavors, and ingredients to avoid. The two top goals you voted for were:

* **Happy Gut**¬† (digestion, bloating, microbiome balance)
* **Recovery / Energy Refuel**¬† (muscle repair, reduced soreness, sustained energy)

I‚Äôve taken all the feedback + nutritional science and turned it into a¬†**visual map**¬†of interchangeable smoothie ingredients.

You can mix-and-match one from each column to create your own¬†*personalized*¬†smoothie that actually tastes good¬†*and*delivers the function you want.

**How to use the map:**

1. Pick one ingredient from each column (Base, Fruit, Booster, Liquid).
2. Keep your goal in mind (gut or energy).
3. Follow this general proportion formula:
   * **Base (creamy texture)**¬†‚Üí ¬Ω‚Äì1 cup (banana, avocado, zucchini, yogurt)
   * **Fruit (flavor + micronutrients)**¬†‚Üí 1‚Äì1¬Ω cups (berries, pineapple, mango, etc.)
   * **Booster (targeted benefit)**¬†‚Üí 1‚Äì2 tbsp (chia, flax, nut butter, seeds, cacao, ginger, etc.)
   * **Liquid (blending + consistency)**¬†‚Üí 1‚Äì1¬Ω cups (plant milk, coconut water, green tea, etc.)
4. Blend and enjoy!

Same story for protein, especially for vegetarians and vegans ‚Äî it‚Äôs tricky to hit the target without a very intentional plan.

It got me thinking:

What if we could design a¬†**single smoothie**¬†that covers all of this in¬†*one shot*?

I‚Äôve been reflecting on my recent smoothie recipes, and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve realized:

A good recipe isn‚Äôt just random healthy stuff blended together ‚Äî it‚Äôs a balance of:

a)¬†**Taste**¬†(you actually want to drink it)

b)¬†**Texture**¬†(creamy, smooth, not sludge)

c)¬†**Flavor harmony**¬†(ingredients ‚Äúmarry‚Äù instead of fight)

d)¬†**Purpose**¬†(measurable benefit to your health)

The big question is¬†**how to approach building it**:

* **Feeling-driven**¬†‚Üí start with how someone wants to feel (energized, calm, recovered)
* **Science-driven**¬†‚Üí base it on blood work and nutrient gaps
* **Known-effect-driven**¬†‚Üí combine ingredients we¬†*already know*¬†have specific effects
* **Other?**¬†‚Üí maybe a hybrid approach

I‚Äôm curious:¬†**If you were designing the ultimate ‚Äúone-a-day‚Äù smoothie, how would you decide what goes in it?**

I (24f) am starting out on my weight loss journey. The problem is, I‚Äôm lactose intolerant and this to me, makes things so much harder. I normally have a drink (up&go) with 8g of protein and 179kcal (dairy-free) in the morning to boost my energy, then just live off of salami sticks (around 30-40g protein and around 550 kcal for 1 pack) for the rest of the day until dinner. My partner cooks so he tries his best to incorporate a balanced meal with protein and fibre. I also currently drink bubble tea in the afternoons, and this is 0% sugar. The first step is to cut out the bubble tea of course, and then substitute my dairy-free drink in the morning for something with more protein and less calories. I am stuck in this part as I cannot have a normal protein shake as they contain dairy, smoothies contain fibre but too much carbs and sugar. 

I am 58kg trying to go down to 50kg (original weight). My mum constantly makes comments about my weight and about my body too so it really doesn‚Äôt help my self-esteem and body image.

Hello 

I'm battling with some anxiety, some depression and specifically with low mood, lack of motivation and some irritability at times.

I've been trying some antidepressants but I was never able to stay on them to long nor was I taking the prescribed dose.

I'm starting with some supplements and I would like to ask anyone to share their knowledge based on their experience or knowledge.

I'm taking the following; 

MORNING:
500- 1000 MG L TYROSINE ( ON EMPTY STOMACK) 

AFTER BREAKFAST:

1 PROBIOTICS PILL
1 OMEGA -3 Pill 
1 L THEANINE PILL( 200 MG) 
1 VITAMIN D+ VITAMIN K PILL
1 B COMPLEX VITAMIN PILL.

AFTER LUNCH 
1 PANAX GINSENG PILL ( 400 MG) 
1 ZINK PILL ( 15 MG) 

EARLY EVENING 
1 L THEANINE PILL (200 MG) 
1 OMEGA-3 PILL 


LATE EVENING/NIGHT

2 5 HTP PILLS ( 100 MG TOTAL) 

I ALSO DRINK MACA WITH MY SMOOTHIE IN THE MORNING ( 5 G POWDER MACA) 

I'm currently on day there with this stack.

1me2gys,healthyeating,Help with Vegetables,"I have such a visceral aversion to vegetables, and every vegetable has made me gag at one point or other.

I can enjoy carrots, cauliflower and brocoli when cooked a very specific way. Mix veg in well to a stir fry or bolognese and my list of tolerable veg expands but I'd still probably prefer the meal without them.

Anything else under any other circumstances is at best a serious chore, and at worst I'm gagging violently.

I haven't even touched Avocado since, I gagged so terribly trying to eat that.

I cannot eat cold veg. Salad is off the menu. I used to beg my Step Dad to serve the lettuce and cucumbers separately, so I could at least enjoy the sandwich part of the meal before violently gagging down the rest. I always take the veg off a burger.

I feel like essentially I have one shot to incorporate veg into my day. I have to get all five of my veg portions into my hot meal or I won't have any, so if I'm not feeling up to cooking one night, no veg.

Because there are no convenient veg options for me. Pubs, and restaurants almost always do veg as a side on its own or served cold, neither of which I can stomach. Even pasta dishes barely seem to contain veg.

I've occasionally just stuck frozen veg in the microwave to eat alongside a jacket potato, or fish and chips, but it remains such a chore, and I have to ruin a tastier part of my meal to avoid gagging on it.

I can't just snack on carrot sticks or stick lettuce in a sandwich. Either I have a proper home cooked meal with veg, or I don't eat veg that day.

I don't know how to fix it.

While we're at it, let's also mention my aversion to fruit. I can eat apples, banana and and grapes. I can stomach pears and strawberries but it's a chore. Smoothies make me gag. Orange juice is alright taste wise but makes me feel queasy for some reason, and if you add juicy bits it's instantly disgusting.

I don't care as much with fruit as I can stomach five different kinds and they are convenient options, but its still a small pallette.",2025-07-31 14:04:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1me2gys/help_with_vegetables/

1m8kd99,nutrition,Fiber Size and Sugar Absorption (2025 Research),"Hello all,

Many moons ago, I remember listening to Dr. Lustig rant and rave about how smoothies are bad since blending fruit ""shreds"" the insoluble fiber content that protects against their natural sugars.

At first, I took Lustig's claim at face value, but recently, I have been doing my own research and have found that to not be the case at all. The only difference appears to be fiber size, which doesnt really matter. The only ""problem"" with smoothies according to everything I've seen, is that they often contain a lot of fruit, and thus you consume more sugar at once. So, even if the fiber protects against the sugar absorption rate, youre just so overloaded that smoothies can therefore be bad.

Is my research accurate??  Is there any evidence at all that the fiber is destroyed, thereby making smoothies worse than eating whole fruits??  Does fiber size matter? 

Anyone who has studied this, please let me know!   Are they the same or worse?

And it works well. It actually adds to the flavor. There's none of that ""gag me"" effect you often get with kale and other greens. 

The scramble I've been basing this on is ""Joe's Special"" from Original Joe's (recipes available online). Below is my variation on Joe's Special. This ""Joe's Special"" scramble is wide open to variations and experimentation.

The primary ingredients I've been using in the scrambles are whole grains ‚Äî millet, rice, quinoa, others ‚Äî plus pea protein powder, plus a bunch of great spices (Szechuan seasoning freshly ground, dried minced onion and garlic, fresh ginger, fresh garlic, a bit of sweetener, balsamic vinegar, sweet basil, sometimes Italian herbs, black pepper, turmeric, nutmeg or mace (these add a very nice touch ‚Äî I learned to use them through researching Original Joe's recipes), dried mushrooms, a little peanut butter, a little toasted sesame oil or olive oil).

I pressure cook it all, and at the end stir and fluff, then add a good-sized scoop (~one heaping tablespoon) of the kale powder and stir it in. 

It's great. 

If anybody else has any ideas please post. I believe in dark green leafy vegetables (especially dark green leafy cruciferous vegetables), and this is one way of getting more of them into one's diet.

1jhhh5r,nutrition,Protein: building blocks and fuel source,"Protein has become one of if not the most prevalent topics in health, sport, and nutrition in recent years. This sub sees multiple protein-based questions every week, the number of protein-fortified food products has soared, influencers are drinking chicken smoothies, etc.

One topic that I am surprised rarely comes up (and yes, I searched the sub history and found pretty much nothing) is the exclusivity of protein utilization as a building block vs as a fuel source. 

Everywhere you look you will see calories attributed to protein. This makes sense because proteins can be used to generate energy. It's 4ish calories per gram (although utilization is inefficient per TEF and the real output may only be 3ish calories per gram). This is why the calories for e.g. a 82g chicken breast is listed as 128, 104 of which come from 26g of protein. 

The problem with this common understanding is that our bodies need to use an amount newly-digested amino acids every day to replace degraded ones or to grow. We can recycle some, but not everything. And an amino acid cannot simultaneously be used to build a protein AND be deaminated for energy. It's either one or the other. 

Of course, the body's choice to use an amino acid for one purpose or another is quite complicated. The common way to talk about it is to say that the body prefers carbs and fats for energy and won't turn to protein for calories unless it runs out of the other two. However, if you consume more protein than necessary the excess will be used for energy (yes, that energy will be stored as fat in excess), and there is probably some protein metabolism happening at all times. 

But we know there must be some amount of protein that does not enter our energy system at all because it gets used as building blocks for other stuff. The entire reason protein is tending today is because of all the non-caloric benefits of protein - we're not drinking protein shakes because we need the calories. 

Let's say a typical person has a TDEE of 2000 kcal and also needs 50g of protein for basic maintenance. If such a person were to eat 2200 calories per nutrition labels, including 100g protein, it would appear that person consumed an excess of 200 calories. Do that every day and the math suggests that person will gain 20ish pounds of fat in a year - that's a lot! But if 50g of protein is being used as building blocks to repair muscle, build hormones, etc, then that person is not consuming excess calories at all. They will not gain any weight. 

Given the obsession with calorie counting, protein macro counting, etc, it puzzles me that we don't have common estimates for protein utilization. There are endless debates about how much protein we should eat, but no one is saying ""the first Xg of protein provide zero calories."" 

I can imagine a few possible reasons for this:

1 - This level of analysis doesn't boil down to easy advice (like eat Xg protein per day), so no one bothers.

2 - Somehow our bodies really can have their cake and eat it too when it comes to amino acids. 

3 - Utilization is actually quite a small percentage of protein consumed, such that it is negligible. Maybe we're only using 5g per day, and if we want to induce our bodies to use an extra gram we have to eat 20-30 grams. 

4 - no one has thought of it before (probably not).

Hence the title question. Not a expert in nutrition science but my intuition is that food with shorter expiration time means more active ingredients. Maybe it reacted with oxygen and what not?  Is this why these healthy food are anti-inflammation and good for you in general? If that's the case, should we be going for food that are hard to preserve more than those easy to preserve within the same category? 

  
In other words, my question is this. Obviously, across categories, for example, nuts are easier to preserve than vegetables and they are both good.

L'√©t√© est la saison id√©ale pour se rafra√Æchir avec des boissons naturelles et pleines de saveurs. Les smoothies, ces m√©langes onctueux de fruits frais, de l√©gumes et parfois de produits laitiers ou v√©g√©taux, deviennent les stars de nos cuisines. Non seulement ils hydratent le corps par temps chaud, mais ils apportent aussi une dose g√©n√©reuse de vitamines, de min√©raux et d'antioxydants essentiels pour maintenir notre √©nergie. Imaginez commencer votre journ√©e avec un verre color√© qui allie plaisir gustatif et bienfaits sant√© : c'est la promesse des smoothies estivaux. Que vous soyez un amateur de saveurs tropicales ou de notes acidul√©es, ces boissons personnalisables s'adaptent √† tous les palais et √† tous les modes de vie.

Au c≈ìur de l'√©t√©, les fruits de saison comme les fraises, les p√™ches, les mangues et les past√®ques inspirent des cr√©ations infinies. Un smoothie √† la fraise et au citron, par exemple, offre une fra√Æcheur vivifiante gr√¢ce √† l'acidit√© du citron qui √©quilibre la douceur sucr√©e des fraises. Ajoutez-y une poign√©e de menthe pour une touche herbac√©e qui √©voque les jardins ensoleill√©s. Ces recettes ne demandent que quelques minutes de pr√©paration : il suffit d'un blender, de fruits m√ªrs et d'un liquide de base comme du jus d'orange ou du lait d'amande. L'avantage ? Ils sont parfaits pour utiliser les surplus de fruits du march√©, √©vitant ainsi le gaspillage tout en favorisant une alimentation saine et locale.

Pour ceux qui cherchent √† booster leur nutrition, les smoothies peuvent se transformer en v√©ritables alli√©s bien-√™tre. Int√©grez des superaliments comme les √©pinards, les graines de chia ou le gingembre pour ajouter des fibres, des om√©ga-3 et des propri√©t√©s anti-inflammatoires. Un smoothie mangue-avocat, par exemple, combine la richesse cr√©meuse de l'avocat avec l'exotisme de la mangue, fournissant des graisses saines et des vitamines A et C. C'est une option id√©ale pour un petit-d√©jeuner rapide ou une collation post-sport, aidant √† la r√©cup√©ration musculaire. Et pour les adeptes du v√©g√©talisme, remplacez le yaourt par du lait de coco ou d'avoine, rendant ces boissons accessibles √† tous.

Si vous manquez d'inspiration, de nombreuses ressources en ligne regorgent d'id√©es cr√©atives. Par exemple, pour d√©couvrir une s√©lection vari√©e de recettes estivales, je vous recommande cet article complet sur [30 recettes de smoothies aux fruits faciles et rafra√Æchissants](https://www.recette.plus/blog/idees-de-recettes/11812-smoothies-dete-30-recettes-aux-fruits-faciles-et-rafraichissantes.html), qui propose des combinaisons originales comme le smoothie rhubarbe-nectarine ou le tropical mangue-banane. Ces suggestions vous permettront d'exp√©rimenter et de personnaliser vos propres versions, en adaptant les ingr√©dients √† vos pr√©f√©rences ou √† ce que vous avez sous la main.

Enfin, les smoothies d'√©t√© ne sont pas seulement une boisson : ils incarnent un mode de vie joyeux et sain. En buvant des smoothies tous les jours, vous prenez soin de votre sant√© avec des fruits naturels. Ils sont parfaits pour se rafra√Æchir pr√®s de la piscine ou pour bien commencer la journ√©e.",2025-08-12 15:10:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smoothies/comments/1mobcao/les_smoothies_d√©t√©_une_explosion_de_fra√Æcheur_et/

* Broccoli
* Cauliflower
* Peas
* Corn
* Potatoes

10v34qx,HealthyFood,Blueberry Smoothie,"Hello, I am generally active and fit, my corrent goal with food is to get enough protein, eat a variety and keep a slight caloric deficit.

lately I heard about the many benfits of consuming blueberries daily, so I started to consume them.

I found out that buying fresh, could be almost 5 times more expensive than frozen. so I decided to buy frozen blueberries and blend them into a shake every two days roughly.

the smoothie include:

* handfull of blueberries
* milk/high protein soy milk
* sometime I add a single date
* sometimg I add protein powder

My machine is the: ""Ninja SS101 Foodi Smoothie Maker & Nutrient Extractor""

it has many settings like: ""EXTRACT"", ""SMOOTHIE"", "" SPREAD"" and ""BOAL"". i don't really understand them so I only set it to SMOOTHIE.

(the smoothie is usually high protein since I workout alot) everytime I make a smoothie I drink all of it right away, I really like and enjoy the smoothie, even more than eating the blueberries raw.

The problem is I heard that I lose many health benefits because I mix the blueberries into a smoothie. cells are being cut in the blender and some fibers are destroyed, addtionally, I heard that after blending, the exposure to oxygen cause some neutrients to escape, although I drink it right away so I guess it doesn't matter that much.

My Question Is:

What Is really lost when I blend the blueberries, health wise (do I lose vitamin E?, Antioxidants? etc) and if that lost is significant or negligible.

additionally, would you recommed to continue making those smoothies? would you suggest changing my recipe? what would you do? (assming we had the same health goals)",2023-02-06 10:12:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/10v34qx/blueberry_smoothie/

103i40l,HealthyFood,How to stick to your 23‚Äô healthy eating resolutions!,"Here‚Äôs simple yet effective tips to make your resolutions a lasting lifestyle. 

1. DRINK MORE WATER. When you wake up, when you want a snack, when you‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôre actually hungry or bored. Due to primitive survival instincts our minds have a hard time distinguishing between hunger and thirst. There‚Äôs nothing healthier than water!!!

2. WILL POWER DOESNT WORK. You know who has the strongest will power ? - the people who avoid it. Don‚Äôt buy a pint of Ben and Jerry‚Äôs if you know you‚Äôll eat it in one day. Don‚Äôt keep junk food in the house if you can‚Äôt help but binge. If I need ice cream, I buy an ice cream bar (not a tub) Know yourself, work with yourself, avoid having to use ‚Äúwill power‚Äù

3. AVOID PROCESSED FOODS! Is it full of preservatives? Is it ten steps away from something that grows in nature? Stay away!!! You can still be a lazy or cheap eater and keep it natural. Try nuts, eggs, canned or jarred foods. Find inspiration at your local farmers market. Check ingredients!!

4. FIND YOUR FAVORITE SEASONINGS. You don‚Äôt need to be a good cook if you have good seasoning. My favorite is Everything But The Bagel seasoning from Trader Joe‚Äôs. I put it on everything.

5. FIND JOY IN EATING HEALTHY. Make colorful dishes, thank yourself before every meal, splurge on a water bottle you love. For example, I made my morning smoothie my daily ritual. It is part of my meditation each day. I associate my healthy habit with self love!!

Good luck on your healthy food journey in 2023 everyone :)",2023-01-04 23:04:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/103i40l/how_to_stick_to_your_23_healthy_eating_resolutions/

I drink like 2 cups of tea, 1 cup of coffee then I might eat again, trying to stop that for weight loss and I know I don't need the food but the job is boring so I wander and get snacks. I go home around 7am and drink another smoothie or vegan protein meal like Soylent then rinse and repeat.

zcw8ld,HealthyFood,Oats vs grounded brown rice,"I was just reading online about a better alternative to oats due to their phytic acid levels.

""Oats contain phytic acid, which impairs the absorption of iron, zinc, calcium, and more, and blocks the production of digestive enzymes, making your oats much harder on your stomach""

My question is: has anyone tried grinding brown rice and using it their shakes oppose to oats? If so, how's the taste and consistency?

I eat about 2 cups of oats a day, and I'm really considering moving to brown rice in my smoothies. 

Advice would be appreciated.

1gb4hn6,veganrecipes,Does anyone know a good cheap protein powder without blueberry?,"Not just any protein powder either. I‚Äôm kinda being picky with this one.

My partner can‚Äôt eat blueberries (allergic but not deathly) and a ton of protein powder has blueberry in it, I assume due to high antioxidants. I also noticed protein powder is damn expensive, especially the ones that don‚Äôt have blueberry?

I have tried some more unique ones, like hemp yeah! I believe, and that one just wasn‚Äôt quite right. We eat a lot of hemp seeds anyway, and it worked for like adding to a pasta, but not putting in a smoothie. At least, not always, and my partner was a little pickier about that too.

The other big hurdle is they‚Äôre all random flavors? Unflavored is uncommon, and they are often just various flavors, which I don‚Äôt really like any of them enough in my experience to commit fully to one flavor every time, and a lot of these flavored protein powders are too sweetened to use easily for baking, or the flavor just doesn‚Äôt allow for savory or plain uses too.

**TLDR: I don‚Äôt need to rely on protein powder for protein, but I like to have a lot of smoothies and baked goods and such, and I wanted to see if anyone has any brands they recommend that aren‚Äôt too expensive, don‚Äôt have blueberry, and maybe have flavor variety or unflavored options.**

Also, the prices seem to vary a lot depending where you buy? Maybe I need help on that front instead? I shop Sprouts, Aldi, Trader Joe‚Äôs, Thrive Market, and rarely Walmart or Target. Sprouts seems the most expensive, Walmart seems cheaper, other places seem to have little to no vegan selection where I‚Äôm at, but maybe I just am not reading it well or could get it shipped, so let me know what and where you buy!",2024-10-24 14:52:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/1gb4hn6/does_anyone_know_a_good_cheap_protein_powder/

So, favorite ways to ingest a variety of vegetables? Smoothies are obvious but tbh I can always taste it in there and I don't like it. The ones I can't taste have so much sugar and stuff added it defeats the purpose. 

I am actually a really good cook and baker, so nothing is really off the table except avocado. I also like to batch cook. Some things I typically eat to get ideas going: seitan (many kinds, homemade only), ""bowl of rice with stuff on it"" type meals (although tbh i am trying to cut out white rice because its not great nutritionally), tofu (a couple specific recipes, pretty picky about it), bread/sandwiches/loaf type foods, pasta w/various cheez type sauces on it or cashew parmesan, dumplings sometimes

Thanks for any recipes!",2024-09-02 22:45:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/1f7ka7d/favorite_ways_to_eat_veggies/

Anyone else playing with it as an ingredient?  In theory it is far more shelf stable and easier than keeping raw cashews on hand.  It also seems to have the fat mostly removed.  I guess I technically made a savory smoothie?  So those applications, especially when cooking for 1or 2, seem ideal.

I think I want to try a cauliflower/miso/pb2 Alfredo next.  Any ideas?

My soup was:  1 can of unsalted, drained diced tomatoes saut√©ed with garlic and olive oil 

Added the juice and 1 little can low sodium v8 plus 1 tsp of Better than Boullion veggie and a cup of water

Simmered for a few minutes 

Added 3 tbl PB2 cashew powder

Pureed with my immersion blender

Added a bunch of fresh dill, covered, let it wilt in the hot soup for a few minutes (pulled out the dill stems before eating)

Feel free to check my previous post for more info. 
 
Heres the 1 year bulk update: 127 to 200lbs
Not looking to be shredded or lean, the second photo (tanned) is me after last summer where I naturally loose a lot of weight from swimming daily. Same will probably happen after this summer.

My full meal plan on the last photo, it is not optimal for everybody but it works for me, especially during winter.

Biggest tip I can give is try to find one meat you really like, and eat it daily with potatoes or rice.
Work your way up to 3 meals a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) THEN start including snacks throughout the day whenever you get hungry.

FOR DRINKS:
2-3 Litres of multivitamin pineapple & mango smoothie every day.
I never drink water, only full fruit smoothies & thick juices to substitute for not eating full solid fruits (I do not have time to eat 5 fruits daily).

The mass gainer brand I use is optimum nutrition (DO NOT order from Amazon).

(The 1kg potatos every day is DEFINITELY overkill lol)

I‚Äôve always been incredibly skinny. I attribute it to my family‚Äôs genetics + my height and lifestyle. As a kid I would eat poorly but do a lot of cardio and exercise (as in playing sports and running) but primarily I‚Äôve always had and still to this day have a very poor appetite. I would skip breakfast and have 2 meals and call it a day basically. During the pandemic I started working out but after a month or two stopped and never came back until last year.

I wish I had stayed consistent this last year. Unfortunately many things ended up getting in the way and I just couldn‚Äôt handle studying and meal prepping and working out whilst sleeping poorly due to sleep apnea. Eventually just would get tired of dieting and working out. Even though time wise it took me over a year for these results in reality I worked out and ate properly for 5 months or so. I would eat and workout consistently for a month or two then go back to eating poorly and not doing much for 3 months or so. Not proud of letting bad habits come back. But I‚Äôm starting cpap therapy and hopefully once I fix my sleep this year‚Äôs objective is to stick to the routine permanently. Since I‚Äôm currently at 64 kg (lost 3 kg from that last pic).

On another subject my diet (when actually sticking to it) consisted of eating a minimum of 3800 calories each day. Basically eating a bunch of eggs at breakfast, some extra meals during the day, and a 1000 calorie smoothie. 

Workout: PPL from home with a bench dumbbells and a pull up bar for equipment.

In conclusion I‚Äôm happy I was able to change my physique even though I lost almost half of my progress due to poor habits lately.
I‚Äôm going to start the routine again and try to stick by it the whole year.

1i31bau,gainit,135-185 lbs 18-21 y/o 36 months of training ,"From 135lbs at 18 to 185lbs at 21, it wasn‚Äôt always smooth sailing. When I started, one of my biggest struggles was eating enough, I always felt too full and couldn‚Äôt imagine how people hit their calories every day. It wasn‚Äôt until I simplified my meals, added calorie-dense foods, and stayed consistent that I finally started seeing real gains.

My training followed a simple Push, Pull, Legs split, with a focus on compound lifts like bench press, squats, deadlifts, and pull-ups. Progressive overload was my main priority, steadily increasing weight or reps to keep pushing myself. Something that was huge for me that not a lot of people talk about is mobility work and explosive movements like box jumps, sleds, etc. Not only did this improve my lifts, but it also gave me a more athletic look instead of a bulky, stiff physique.

On the nutrition side, I ate in a calorie surplus, hitting at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight. My diet was built around lean proteins, carbs like rice and potatoes, and healthy fats. I also added high-calorie snacks like peanut butter and smoothies to make hitting my targets easier. Staying consistent with my eating was a game-changer.


If you‚Äôre struggling to figure it all out, know this: you don‚Äôt have to overcomplicate things, but sometimes thinking outside the box can make all the difference.",2025-01-16 22:32:02,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i31bau
1h0hpud,gainit,3 month 73.1~80.5 kg  161~177  lb/ 6‚Äô2 /189 cm,"
Hey guys, I just wanted to share my 3-month progress as a hard gainer (ectomorph). I'll keep it simple.

Nutrition

The most important factor should be your top priority. I gain about 0.5 kg (1.1 lbs) per week, which is 500 calories above maintenance. I know it‚Äôs not what most recommend, but as someone who burns a lot with even minimal activity, this keeps me on track. For example, if I ate only 250 calories above maintenance, just climbing some stairs could make me lose half of that.

Meals:

Meal 1: A burrito with a smoothie (milk, banana, and oil). I make the burritos myself. It‚Äôs just a tortilla with ground beef. This meal comes around 2500-2700 calories.

Meal 2: 100g Ulker biscuits and 25g of peanut butter. I mix the biscuits with water and wash down the peanut butter with water as well.


Workout

I train my full body every 3 days, with all sets taken to failure. I based my routine on Max Euceda‚Äôs push-pull-legs, doing a total of 45 sets. I decided to split it into 15 sets every 3 days for a full-body workout.


Tips:

I burn about 800-1000 calories during my workout, so I make sure to add those calories to my intake, or I‚Äôll lose weight (I track this with my Apple Watch).

How to calculate your maintenance calories? Calorie calculators didn‚Äôt work for me, so I did this: eat the same thing for 6 days, then average the calories for each 3-day period. Now my maintenance is 2980 calories, and at 80.5 kg, I need about 37 calories per kg. So, whatever my weight is, I just multiply by that number. It might change over time, but at least you have a baseline.

I will put workout and burrito links below",2024-11-26 17:41:28,https://i.redd.it/fp6qsk4v8a3e1.jpeg

195dm5f,gainit,Tips for Minimal Effort,"In the past year I've committed to 2  3-month bulks while weightlifting, and feel like I learned a lot. It has always been very difficult for me to eat enough, either because my stomach is not used to it or due to nausea. I feel like I've learned a lot of tricks for eating more and eating better that are worth sharing. My philosophy around bulking is to follow a few rules:

1. [200-500 calorie surplus is ideal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRltyPPBZMo), 300 is a good number to aim for.
2. Need 0.8\*(body weight in lbs) grams of protein per day to [maximize muscle building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pok0Jg2JAkE&t=339s).
3. With those things in mind, make your food ***as palatable as possible***.
4. Lastly, do everything possible to ***minimize complexity and effort required for meals***\*.\*

My meal plan breaks down as follows:

Days when I'm working out:

**--Morning--**

3 scoops of Huel (600 calories, 45g protein)

**--Workout--**

1 protein smoothie (1200 calories, 105g protein) (2 bananas, 1 cup whole Greek yogurt, 2 scoops protein powder, 2 cups 2% milk, 1 cup oatmeal)

**--Dinner--**

Chipotle chicken burrito (1055 calories, 57g protein) (you can use the calculator

OR

Whatever you want, just as long as it has some meat in it, aim for 1000-1200 calories depending on the goal. Sometimes I get a burger, or make something with beef in it since that is the most fatty and has the most calories. Or if I'm lazy I'll get some fast food as long as it meets the calorie requirement. No need to have something with high protein since you already have 150g protein which is already enough for most people. Also, if your goal is different from mine (2800-3000) then whole milk in the smoothie, more Huel, or queso/chips and guacamole with the burrito will add a few extra hundred calories.

&#x200B;

**My own results**

I did a 2900 calorie per day bulk for 3 months and went from 174-184lbs at 5'9"". Then, another 3 month bulk I did 171-180lbs. The main goal with the above routine was to make it as easy as possible to follow consistently from day to day, and tick the most important nutritional boxes. Hope this helps someone else trying to bulk!

Fast forward to today, and I now weigh 62 kilograms. I noticed that my weight was steadily increasing each week until the middle of January, but since then it has plateaued. To continue making progress, I increased my calorie intake to approximately 3300 calories per day and upped my gym visits to 5-6 times per week. I train core 2 timer per week.

Initially, my abs became more visible, but I struggled to consume all the required calories. To make it easier, I started having a protein weight gain smoothie every day, which provides 1030 calories. But, today I've noticed that my abs have become less visible.

I'm a bit concerned that I'll become too fat while bulking, for example I add 3 tablespoons of olive oil to my smoothie, which is a source of pure fat. However, I do have more visible muscles in other areas such as my biceps for example.

Is this a normal process? Should I make any changes to my diet or workout routine?

I don't know how to reduce it while gaining muscles. The fat is only around belly, everywhere else I'm skinny af. You can see rib cage just above my belly but around belly there is fat.

zqom8h,gainit,2 years progress 160 lbs - 200 lbs,"6'2 29m

I started out on this site and got a lot of info on how to get down the calories I need every day. Blending is the way to go. Thank you.

I was always skinny and only ate a lot in bursts. Was never really hungry, but gaining was the only way I could feel confident about myself. I honestly never thought I'd be able to do it for so long.

I started out taking supplements like protein powder and creatine. My strength increased massively, but it all faded away when I cut the supps out of my diet last year. I'm now stronger than I was but without the extra water weight from the supplements.

My diet isn't spectacular, but I'm eating around 2500 calories a day. Eggs, chicken, tuna wraps, beef, rice, broccoli, fruit smoothies, cereal, and various snacks.

I always thought you had to go from a bulking phase to a cutting phase, but slowly gaining over time was just as good for me. Of course, I'm still not deadlifting 600 lbs, so there's that.

Lifts:

Bench: 225 lbs x 8

Linear Leg Press: 990 lbs x 6 (no longer interested in squatting)

Single-arm machine row: 5 plates (225lbs) x 6

yyo36e,gainit,[Program Review] 13 Weeks of gaining - BBB Beefcake plus Building the Monolith,"Hi guys. 

After finishing my BBB Beefcake (write up: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/xvb1gv/review\_bbb\_beefcake\_152lb\_165lb\_in\_6\_weeks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/xvb1gv/review_bbb_beefcake_152lb_165lb_in_6_weeks/) ) I decided to move on with Building the Monolith, running the pattern our good friend u/MythicalStrength has laid out for us.

In this review, I want to go more into BtM and how my 13 weeks of bulking went in total. I'll try to keep it compact here again.

**Picture pre bulk (August 21th 2022):** [**https://imgur.com/jVwjPD8**](https://imgur.com/jVwjPD8)  **152lb**

**Picture post bulk (November 18th 2022):** [**https://imgur.com/qCugMgz**](https://imgur.com/qCugMgz)  **170lb**

Height: 5'9

I am aware I gained some fat around the belly but I'm not even mad. I'm happy I was able to gain at all. Biggest notable change for me was my bigger thighs, arms and the strength I gained.

TMs:

&#x200B;

||Before BBB Beefcake|After BBB Beefcake/before BtM|After BtM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Squats|265|275|295|
|Benchpress|185|190|210|
|Deadlifts|310|320|340|
|Press|100|105|115|

As you can see, my TMs jumped too much for each lift after running BtM. That was an error I made due to an app I was using to run the program. Honestly, I just noticed this after I finished the 4th week of it so yeah. I STILL managed to finish all reps. No harm's done. lol.

About my training:

* Agile 8 and jumps every workout (10 box jumps or long jumps)
* Most workouts done at home. I only needed some mental support for the week 6 5x5 squats so I went to a gym with a friend.
* I did all required reps for BtM, including all assistance exercises. I went for 100-130 reps for dips. 
* All assistance exercises were done in a circuit fashion. E.g. chins+dips, press+facepulls, benchpress+db rows etc. Only squats and deadlifts were done without any supersets.
* Conditioning almost everyday. Most of the time it was just 2-3 miles of weighted vest walking, sometimes I did stuff like Prowler pushing, weighted vest circuits, complexes etc.
* Starting on week 3 of BtM, I started to incorporate conditioning after my workout. For example I did my workout, drank a protein shake and then went for a 3mile walk with my weighted vest.

Progression:

* Honestly felt strong every single day. First time running 5x5 squats at 90% was kind of hard but I pulled through. The really tough part was hitting the 100 reps for chins+dips as a superset.
* First time chins+dips took me 18 sets. In week 5, I only needed 10 sets for 100 reps.
* As I mentioned, I finished all reps on every single workout.

PR Result:

* Squats 285lb 5x5 (PR)
* Squats 225lb 1x20 (PR)
* Benchpress 200lb 5x5 (PR)

Eating:

* I ate a lot. Like, I was always hungry for more. I might have overeaten a bit as one can see on my stomach. Then again, my stomach and hips are always first to come when I gain weight. But that's what a cut is for! 
* I did not count calories but I made sure to include lots of protein to every meal.
* Smoothies when time was short.

Other notes:

* Shortest workout was about 55min.
* Longest workout was 95min.

I'm quite happy with the results of my lifts. I improved a lot with them. 

Next up, I'll have a well deserved diet break for 6 weeks. Most likely going to run simple 531 PR sets + 5x5 FSL.

xvb1gv,gainit,[Review] BBB Beefcake: 152lb -> 165lb in 6 weeks,"Hey fellow gainers.

As part of my journey on MythicalMass, the first stop is to do 6 weeks of BBB Beefcake. As for this review, I will keep it simple.

Quick view on my TMs:

&#x200B;

||Before|After|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Squats|265|275|
|Benchpress|185|190|
|Deadlifts|310|320|
|Press|100|105|

So nothing spectacular in terms of TM changes (obviously).

On a sidenote, this is my second run of BBB Beefcake. I ran it back in February this year and just ran it OG style (PR sets, 5/3/1 weeks). This time, I used 5s PRO to keep some gas in my tank and did 3/5/1 programming for the mini deload inbetween my cycles.

About my training:

* Did Agile 8 before every workout
* Jumps and throws were done sporadically (due to working out at 5am most of the time and I don't want to wake up my neighbors)
* On that note - I did almost all workouts in my homegym
* On benchpress days, I did ab wheel and bulgarian split squats as accessory exercises
* On press days, I did hanging leg raises and calf raises as accessory exercises
* As for rowing, I did single arm dumbbell rows exclusively. Started with 50lb in the first cycle and upped to 55lb on the second cycle.
* At least once per week I added a curling exercise and a triceps extension after my workout
* I aimed to finish all reps on every workout, even if I couldn't do it in 5x10. In that case, I would split the set into 2 sets (for example do 6 reps and then 4)
* I did some conditioning. Weighted vest walks, barbell complexes, crossfit style WODs, prowler pushing, etc. And I hit 10k steps everyday (thank you, my dog)

Progression:

* First day squatting was hell as I was on a 3 week break due to vacation. I just did a TM test the week before. I couldn't even finish all 5x10 sets without splitting up the last 2 sets due to muscular failure
* On the contrary, the last day squatting even felt easy. I had enough breath over that I did 5x 30 yard prowler pushes after the squat day.
* Pressing was my weakest lift and after Beefcake, that didn't change at all. I had problems with my last set on 5x10 that I had to do pushpresses to finish the last 1-2 reps.
* Conditioning improved although I gained 13lb in only 6 weeks.

Eating:

* I began Beefcake with adding 2L milk a day (\~1/2 GOMAD) and reduced it to 1L a day on my second cycle. The reason for that is that after roughly 2-3 weeks I LEARNED how to eat.
* I struggled to eat enough in the beginning, always feeling full and sluggish. Apparently my body quickly adapted to the higher consumption of food so that I felt more comfortable to eat more.
* The goal was to keep eating whenever I had time.
* I didn't count calories at all and I didn't check the scale either. I went with the flow.
* Favorite meals: pasta Bolognese, scrumbled eggs and BirdsEye Crunchy Traybake (this is the real winner of my bulk here)
* Favorite snacks: nuts, yoghurt
* When I had little time to cook and eat, I usually went for a quick high calorie smoothie (1000+ kcal)

Other notes:

* The longest workouts were squat days (avg. 55 minutes)
* The shortest workouts were press days (avg. 35 minutes)

What I would change the next time:

* I would set a goal for my last BBB week to hit some PRs. E.g. do squats with 265lb 5x10 and tune down my main work for that.
* I would add more accessory exercises, mainly for direct arm work, calves and neck.
* Other than that, I really liked Beefcake!

Overall I feel the improvements on most of my lifts. My stomach sure feels ""more round"" as I had a bit of abs definition but I've thrown that aboard for this bulk. I'll get back there before the next summer.

I can definitely recommend running BBB Beefcake to everyone here. It's very demanding but I like that it has a clear structure on what to do on each lifting day.

My journey now continues with a Deload this week and next week, I start Building the Monolith!

xgprsg,gainit,"[Progress] M/28/6'0"" [165lbs > 185lbs = 20lbs] (10 months)","I've wanted to bulk up for a while, but I've struggled with a fast metabolism and constantly getting injured while lifting. Bad shoulders, wrists, and muscle strains. 

Decided enough is enough and went all-in for 2022 with some big changes in mind. I'm super stoked about the progress. But this isn't a victory lap. I still have a lot of work to do. I am proud of myself and wanted to share. Here's the progress, and what I've changed so far:

https://imgur.com/a/bITlA6g

DIET:

Caloric overload. I ate wayy more than I'm comfortable with. I've always had a small appetite, so this part was difficult. I bought myself a blender and made a smoothie every morning with whey, peanut butter, greek yogurt, spinach, and frozen fruit. 

I also made sure to eat 3 full meals a day-- something I didn't always do. As well as to spread my protein intake throughout the day. I got a little bit of a belly at one point, but to me that was just a sign that I'm doing the right thing. I can always lose the weight. 

SUPPLEMENTS:

I started taking preworkout, but eventually didn't like the side-effects (nausea, restlessness) and quit. I take whey protein and creatine daily. 

WORKOUT PHILOSOPHY: 

I am injury prone-- something I've struggled with in the past. I realized that I was wayyy too egotistical with my lifts-- not paying enough attention to form, and was overly obsessed with improving the weights of my lifts. For example, I would increase weight when I wasn't truly ready. I also didn't educate myself on proper form, I thought I knew everything-- I'm still learning new ways to protect my joints. 

I decided to check my ego and keep the weights LOW. The quality of my workouts skyrocketed. I also moved away from free weights as much as possible. Cables and machines are my friends. They take the stress away from my joints and keep me healthy. Other than a small lat strain in March, I've been healthy all year and therefore haven't lost progress. 

I changed the ""why"" for my workouts. Instead of constantly chasing progress, I fell in love with the process. I know this sounds cliche-- I used to glaze over when people said this. But it's so true. My main motivation in going to the gym every day is NOT to chase a better physique. My motivation was the sense of accomplishment of going and making myself better. The knowledge that I'm going to keep going every god damn day-- because I can. To me, this was fulfillment. Progress was simply a happy side-effect. 

I worked out 4 days on, ~1 day off. This would usually mean 5-6 workouts a week, with in the intent to hit targeted muscle groups 2x+ per week. I have a naturally small chest, so I was doing chest exercises daily and at least 2 chest workouts a week. For example, I would work in tricep dips or pushups into every workout.",2022-09-17 15:41:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/xgprsg/progress_m2860_165lbs_185lbs_20lbs_10_months/

x1nf8p,gainit,Feeling somewhat sick to my stomach after each glass of my weight gain shake. Any ideas?,"Hi, 

I am on a quest to gain weight so that when I hit the gym full time I can actually build some muscle and strength. I have been using this recipe for a weight gain shake/smoothie, idk what it is classified as: 

Oatmeal 1/2 cup 

One whole Banana

Spinach handful 

Peanut butter 2tbsp 

Honey 1tbsp 

2 Cups of Milk 

Handful of blueberries

Handful of pumpkin seeds (if lying around) 

This is about 3 cups worth and I try to drink a cup between meals. I have done this for about 2 days now, as I used to try and force down all 3 cups at once and would get knocked out after 2. I would be unable to drink the third. This new strategy has not been working too well, since I seem to feel mildly sick to my stomach after each cup. I would describe this as the very mild early stages of how one feels when one needs to eventually puke. It does not go past this mild sick sensation however, at least not yet. I actually feel this as of writing this, as I just had a glass. I am also sleep deprived so that might affect my clarity of writing in this post. 

I am not lactose intolerant, at least I do not think so, since I usually drink about  a liter of 3.8% fat milk per day and feel fine. 

Does anyone have any ideas as to why I feel this way? I have been able to crush big meals before without feeling this weird sick sensation. Usually if I eat a crap load of spaghetti or something, I just get extremely tired. I only seem to feel this sick sensation with this shake/smoothie idk what to call it. 

I try to make sure my ingredients are not spoiled. Oh and should I keep it refrigerated throughout the day or is it safe to just keep it sitting in the blender throughout the day, since I am trying to drink a glass of it in between meals. 

Any feedback or requests for clarification are appreciated.

ws99wx,gainit,"Not gaining at 3500kcal, hard tracking everything","Hi everyone, 23yo male, 177cm/5‚Äô10 and 55kg/120lb.

I once again started working out and trying to bulk up 2 months ago after numerous failed attempts in the past few years. I do PPL 6 days a week with 1 rest day.

I thought my previous failed attempts were due to smoking cigarettes and it somehow preventing my body from absorbing the nutrients (I ate 3000+ kcal daily on my previous attempts as well). This time I quit smoking and gained 5kg/10lb in the first month at 2800kcal daily, I was beyond happy.

At the end of the first month I suddenly stopped gaining then after a week increased my intake to 3500kcal daily and 3 weeks later I haven't gained a single lb :(.

Good news is I‚Äôve been doing progressive overload every week and still keep increasing weights/reps every session. That and I also quit smoking which is amazing.

Regular day of eating example:

Breakfast: Smoothie - 400ml high fat milk, 60g oats, 1 banana, 2tbsp olive oil, 2tbsp chia seeds (800kcal)

Post Workout: Pesto pasta w/ veal sausage - 125g pasta, 50g red tomato pesto, ~200g veal sausage (1100kcal)

Snack: 50g Nuts + 1 greek yoghurt (550kcal)

Snack #2: 2-3 Sandwiches with some ham (300kcal)

Dinner Salad: Leafy green, cucumber, tomato, green bell pepper, fresh onion (stick type), olive oil (I don't even count this in my app)

Pre-Bed: Same as breakfast smoothie (800kcal)

Macro: 135p, 346c, 186f; Sleep 6-8h per night and nap 1-3h during daytime some days all in attempt to burn less energy. I know fat is high but I'm desperate to put on weight.

Every day of eating is 90% the same as I like the meals and am used to cooking them. I would be incredibly grateful for any help on how to continue gaining.. is it just a matter of eating more even when I have friends weighing 180lb gaining on the same diet?

EDIT #1: After everyone's suggestions and talking to some friends I picked up a full spectrum digestive enzyme, hope it works and I'll report back here in a few weeks.

I was not sure if I need to cut or gain.
Anyways , here is my easy 135 gm protein recipe which I am able to manage these days.

1 scoop -34 gm - 25 gm protein  

Breakfast gives - 50.7 gm protein 

Lunch - Yet to figure out as proper meal, as I don‚Äôt usually get time to make a proper one.I am Indian and I tend to eat some Rice with curries which is not so protein rich I believe.

Dinner:
Kirkland Signature,  Ground Sirloin and Loin of Beef Patties 
28gm protein.                                    
Bun - 7gm protein 

High protein smoothie :( I got this from this sub, but I added 1 scoop of protein powder)
50gm protein 

50 gm - Quaker old fashioned oats     
Skim Milk - 1 cup

2 table spoon Jif peanut butter                    
1 scoop of the same protein powder

I will have to figure out a proper protein rich lunch as well, so the protein intake will be around 155gm(equal to my weight)

With the Breakfast and Dinner it comes around 1700 cal.

Starting weight (129) Pounds.  58Kg 
Current Weight ( 143) Pounds. 65 Kg.

Started working out in May of 2021 after seeing a picture of myself and not realizing how absolutely malnourished I look. Decided I really needed to put on some weight and muscle. I ended up scouring this sub, and gained some tips and motivation from the progress posts I saw on this sub. I'm happy with my results but to be honest have been slacking the past 2 months. Have lost 2 pounds since my high of 145. Currently at 143, and my goal is to get to 150-155 by the end of this year. I realize my progress is a bit slow, As I am continually learning about fitness and nutrition but I am happy with the results! Hoping to continue this journey and gain some mass with you guys. 
lifting Routine: 
3 times a week, full body. 
I have incorporated running into my fitness journey. Trying to run on my rest days, at least twice a week. 
Full body routine at gym takes about 1hr 45- 2 hours. 

Pullups 3-4 sets.
Dumbell bench- 3-4 sets
Squat-4 Sets
Standing DB shoulder press- 3-4 sets
Dips - 3 Sets
Seated Row Machine-  3 Sets

Diet: I have TMJ so its difficult and painful to chew lots, but surprisingly, my TMJ symptoms which is a Jaw disorder related to the Jaw joints have actually improved since I have been on this journey. I think it may be due to the fact I'm eating more and getting more healthy nutrients.

# Things I learned Whilst Bulking

&#x200B;

* Don‚Äôt make a massive change to your diet immediately take it slow and gradually grow. I went full retard and I got sick.
* If you have to dirty bulk to gain motivation, do it! but don‚Äôt do it in the long run. It's not worth it, I still don't have my six-pac.
* Have scheduled eating times, I'd recommend you watch the video for my explanation on why this is so important, but basically, You are more efficient on a routine.
* Master recipes. Much better to struggle eating good food than bland food.
* Work out harder if you loose appetite.",2022-04-16 11:13:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/u4vll2/what_you_can_eat_and_how_you_can_eat_more_to/

I calculated it out one day, and it turns out that it's around 60g of protein just in that one smoothie with the protein scoop. I'm wondering if it's even worth it to add that extra protein in there.

Current daily goal is 3000 calories with \~30% being protein. I'll also eat more if I can, but usually I'm pushing it getting to 3k.

&amp;#x200B;

So I work at Taco Bell usually 3 days a week, and am allowed to make myself food for free when I'm there (as well as to take home). If I'm eating like 1500-2000 calories of TB on those three days, and then a protein shake in the morning and at night (\~750cal/each), is this fine as long as I am hitting my protein macro? For example, yesterday I made it over my calorie goal, had &gt;200g protein after my shakes and all, but my calories were 40% fat, much of which was from taco bell (besides whole milk and peanut butter in the smoothies). Is this alright or is it just going to lead to bad weight gain?

And for clarity, this isn't like a long term plan, I'm honestly just desperate to gain (mostly good) weight. If it helps anything, I do hit the gym on my way home from work to try and put those Taco Bell calories to use. Thanks!

I guess I could benefit from that, but her further suggestions were so upsetting. I told her I work out by weight lifting in the morning, running or power walk after work, and light yoga at night to stretch. I do this about 4-5 times a week. I'm 5'6, 150 lbs, 42 years old. 

Her suggestions included: working out daily (so no rest days???), claiming I need to find indoor exercise for winter and it would do no good to only workout in the summer (even when I never brought that up and actually DO indoor exercise during winter anyway... I actually HAVE a fitness background but I didn't go into that with her). She gave me a 1200 calorie/day meal plan DESPITE me telling her I want to build muscle mass. Doesn't want me using protein powder. I looked at the recipes she sent and one included a snack of frozen grapes dusted with sugar free Kool Aid...WTF!! 

She asked me how many pounds I wanted to lose. I said well at my age I'd rather focus on healthy food choices and muscle mass. She was so committed to getting a number and suggested 135 lbs. I said but wouldn't that interfere with muscle mass? She also wanted me to get a scale that measures fat and muscle mass, and weigh myself every morning. Good God. I'm sure I could stand to lose a few pounds, but for my height/weight and goals, this seems extreme! She then told me to also measure myself with a tape measure and when I see my doctor, let them know about any inch loss and weight loss, because they love to hear that, and often don't hear enough about folks losing weight (??!). It just seems almond mom to the extreme. 

She was also telling me to drink seltzer water, pushing to stop my green smoothies and no more juice, pushing me to stop coffee (only one or two cups a day).  Yes, I know fruit is better than the juice, I only have a small glass of juice with my breakfast in the morning. My green smoothie helps me stay full (the Naked brand smoothie). The rest of the day I drink water. 

I'm so upset because it just seems too much, too fast. I'm not even a heavy weight, my BMI falls within the normal range. She told me if fruits or veggies fall within the ""dirty dozen"", buy organic or don't buy at all. I really can't afford organic on top of today's already expensive groceries. 

I just want to cry. I contacted Berry Street, because no way in hell will this work. 

Had anyone else experienced anything like this? It's not even that I want to stuff my face or anything, but logic tells me with my workouts and my goals, these suggestions will do nothing to help me, and so many of the things she was talking about just seemed like disordered eating.

1mnslud,loseit,New here. Trying to Lose weight,"Hello everyone! I am new to this sub. A bit about me I'm a 42M and I did weigh 260 at 5'10"". Needless to say I've got a belly, and for the majority of my life I've ate whatever I've wanted to. Recently I have decided to make that effort to start losing weight. 3 weeks ago I started walking at different trails in wooded parks. While weighing myself today I am down to 241.9 So pretty close to 9lbs down so far. For context mon to fri at my job I walk over 10,000 steps a day easy. However I've only really started to feel a difference while walking at the park. I haven't made it to 5 days in a row walking yet, that is my next goal. I do make an effort to walk Sat and Sun as those are my 2 biggest sedentary days. I started off walking in the park doing about 2 to 2.5 miles each time. Today I did 3.3 and added on top of what I walked at work I walked 24,959 steps according to my phone. (Which for some reason my watch says only 20k steps)  

I am now looking into getting into the calorie deficit. I could really use some good meal plan recipes for the week. In the morning at work I drink a bolthouse smoothie about 300ish calories, and a cup of coffee(calories unkown), lunch at work I can eat those lean cuisine power bowls, like 400ish calories, then I need a dinner. I think 1500 calories a day is what I'm aiming for? I don't know if that's right. I love chicken! 

I'm pretty committed to this change in life, and what to lose weight. My goal is 220 for now. I absolutely love walking, it's been a huge stress reliever for me, and puts me in a good mood.  So now that I've rambled on, I hope this all makes sense. I believe I am looking for some guidance. What am I doing wrong, what should I focus on. It's all pretty overwhelming to me trying to look a lot of different information up.  Any help is very much appreciated.

1ml4wnn,loseit,Cutting calories by being tired of salad üò≠,"Update: yall, it was worth it. Hit a new low weight this morning. And today I'll do a buffalo chicken wrap instead of caving to the big bad sandwich. Thank you to everyone who understood the actual complaint of this post and could sympathize. 

Life hack, want to cut your calories by even more? Get so sick and tired of lettuce and cucumbers that you can barely stomach a fork full of it.

But seriously, all I want is a crispy chicken sandwich. Maybe a little buffalo sauce, some cheddar cheese, a big pile of onion rings, the good shit. The fat girl shit. And to not have to skip dinner for it. To not even have to budget it in to a day. To be able to eat those poutine fries and not know what they were doing to me. To top it all off with a slice of cheesecake and to not regret all my life choices after.

Part of me misses being able to eat like that and just carry on with my day like nothing happened. The other part of me knows thats how I got here. How I ended up needing to skip on the good shit.

And yeah, I know I can make it at home and fit it into the calorie budget and I should let myself have nice foods, but its the friday night before grocery shopping. I dont want to have to go to the store, buy all the ingredients, come home, cook it, then eat it. I want to order a good sandwich, sit my big back on the couch, and eat.

But I wont. I ate my salad for lunch. Drank my smoothie for breakfast. Fiance wants pizza for dinner, so I'll dab the grease off it and nibble a piece. Might top it off with a serving of halo top. And hopefully tomorrow, when I step on the scale, it'll have been worth it.",2025-08-08 19:40:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ml4wnn/cutting_calories_by_being_tired_of_salad/
1mjz3ke,loseit,Weight Loss and Mental Health,"Hi, I'm 27F, 5'1"", SW 195, CW 180, GW 130. I've been working at it for four months. I'm trying to get some advice for managing mental health with weight loss or maybe get pointed in the right direction. 

I've had a lot of mental health challenges since I hit puberty when I was about 10. This was also about the last time I was at a healthy weight. While I don't want to go into the exact diagnosis, the main mental health challenges that have contributed to my weight gain and retention are executive function issues, some problems with food taste and texture (eg. spinach has to go in a smoothie or it makes me literally gag), depression, and anxiety. I also tend to eat for a dopamine hit.

I went to a weight loss clinic and they put me on Zepbound which helped me lose those first 15 lbs, but it's causing severe anxiety. If the anxiety doesn't get better I might have to go off it all together.

If possible, even if I do go off the Zepbound, I want to continue losing weight. I've plateaued at 180lbs over the last few weeks already.

My main questions for people are:

* What has worked for you to replace that quick dopamine hit you were getting from food? I'm looking specifically for things I can do while working at my desk job.
* What strategies have worked for you for maintaining your mental health as you lose weight?
* What have been your most effective strategies for ""sticking with it"", especially if you also have executive function problems? 

What I've already started doing is:

* Started strength training twice a week. I'm working on getting in some cardio on off days in the form of walking or swimming (joint problems prevent most other things)
   * This has helped my energy levels significantly
* Making sure I actually eat breakfast
* Keeping protein bars in my bag for when I forget breakfast anyway
* Having easy to make meals at home where I can easily store the left overs for a later date
* Weighing myself daily

Also, I got my iron deficiency treated, which I think has helped. 

Some caveats:

* I cannot calorie count. Calorie counting has sent me into mental health spirals before and I would prefer not to repeat the experience
* I don't eat meat. It tends to make me very sick, not sure if that's psychosomatic or not, but I'm not willing to find out
* I am seeing a therapist, but she specializes in social skills and doesn't have a ton of insight into food stuff

I've been looking through other posts on the sub for suggestions, but I figured it was time to take a leap and actually make my own post. ",2025-08-07 12:45:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mjz3ke/weight_loss_and_mental_health/
1miyqza,loseit,"On a Weight Loss Journey - Looking for Feedback, Advice, and a Bit of Encouragement","Hi Reddit,

I'm currently on a weight loss journey and would love to hear your thoughts and advice on my plan. I could also use a bit of encouragement‚Äîit's definitely starting to feel tough at times.

I‚Äôm tackling this from two angles:

1. **Eating at a calorie deficit**
2. **Exercising on weekdays**

A lot of what I‚Äôm doing is based on what works for *me* personally‚Äînot necessarily what‚Äôs ""optimal."" For example, I know adding sugar and white bread to my breakfast isn‚Äôt ideal, but it makes the meal enjoyable and sustainable, so I just account for those calories.

# A Bit About Me:

* Age: 36
* Height: 1.79m
* Weight: 105kg
* Activity level: Moderate exercise 5x/week, but sedentary for the rest of the day (desk job)

From what I‚Äôve calculated, 2000 kcal/day would be an aggressive deficit, and 2300 kcal/day is more moderate. I tried 2000 at first but found it too difficult to sustain after just a few days, so I‚Äôve adjusted to 2300, which feels much more manageable.

# My Weekday Meal Plan

*(\~2300 kcal | 40% Protein / 30% Fat / 30% Carbs)*  
All I drink is water, and this plan was created with ChatGPT to match my calorie goals, support training, and include food I actually enjoy.

**Meal 1 ‚Äì 9:00 AM: Roast Chicken & Egg Toast Plate**

* Roast Chicken (with skin) ‚Äì 100g
* Whole Eggs ‚Äì 2 large (120g)
* White Bread (toast) ‚Äì 2 slices (60g)
* Mrs Balls Chutney ‚Äì 10g Calories: \~570 kcal **Protein: \~40g | Carbs: \~32g | Fat: \~28g**

**Meal 2 ‚Äì 11:30 AM: Protein Smoothie with Fiber Boost**

* 2% Low-Fat Milk ‚Äì 250ml
* Whey Protein ‚Äì 50g
* Banana ‚Äì 75g
* Blueberries ‚Äì 75g
* Peanut Butter ‚Äì 10g Calories: \~500 kcal **Protein: \~50g | Carbs: \~32g | Fat: \~17g | Fiber: \~10g**

**Meal 3 ‚Äì 2:00 PM: Beef & Veg Bowl + Apple & Sauerkraut**

* Lean Beef ‚Äì 200g
* Potatoes ‚Äì 100g
* Carrots + Celery + Onion ‚Äì 40g each
* Olive Oil ‚Äì 5g
* Sauerkraut ‚Äì 40g
* Apple ‚Äì 120g Calories: \~610 kcal **Protein: \~48g | Carbs: \~38g | Fat: \~28g | Fiber: \~7g**

**Meal 4 ‚Äì 5:00 PM: Battercrisp Hake & Veg**

* I&J Battercrisp Hake ‚Äì 200g
* Potatoes (air-fried) ‚Äì 130g (raw weight)
* Carrots + Onion ‚Äì 40g each
* Olive Oil ‚Äì 5g
* Splash of Vinegar (as condiment) Calories: \~620 kcal **Protein: \~50g | Carbs: \~45g | Fat: \~20g | Fiber: \~5g**

**Daily Totals:**  
Calories: \~2300 kcal  
**Protein: \~210g | Carbs: \~147g | Fat: \~65g | Fiber: \~22g**

# My Exercise Routine:

Right now, I‚Äôm doing **30 minutes of heavy bag boxing** and **light swimming every weekday**. The swimming is still new‚ÄîI‚Äôm doing about **200m/day** as I ease my body into it. My goal is to eventually swim **1km daily**.

I know there might be more efficient ways to burn fat, but boxing and swimming are things I *actually enjoy*‚Äîand I think that‚Äôs the most important part for long-term consistency. I wish I liked weight training more, but I just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôd rather stick to something I can see myself doing *5 years from now*.

# Where I'm At:

I‚Äôve been doing this for about **3 weeks** now. It's definitely been a bit up and down.

Last night I gave in after my usual meals and grabbed some Chinese takeout‚ÄîI was still super hungry even after hitting my 2300 kcal goal. That said, most days I definitely end in a calorie deficit, and I‚Äôm trying not to beat myself up over one slip.

**I haven‚Äôt seen much weight loss yet**, but I‚Äôm hoping that with consistency, things will start to shift soon.

Would love to hear:

* Your thoughts on my meal plan or approach
* Any advice for staying full and managing cravings
* Words of encouragement if you've been in the same boat

1memz30,loseit,What‚Äôs one ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô food that secretly wastes your calories?,"Man, I gotta confess something embarrassing. For YEARS I thought I was being so good with my ""healthy"" salads - you know the drill, piled with veggies, some grilled chicken, all that. But then I'd drown the whole thing in ""light"" ranch like I was trying to put out a fire. ""It's fine, it's light!"" I'd tell myself as I poured half the bottle on there.

Then one day I actually measured it. Turns out my ""little drizzle"" was more like 1/4 cup every time. That's an extra 200 calories right there, basically turning my diet salad into a cheat meal. And don't even get me started on those ""healthy"" granola bars that are basically candy bars in disguise.

What about you guys? What foods tricked you into thinking they were safe when they were actually calorie bombs? I'm still salty about the time I realized my ""protein smoothie"" was basically a milkshake with extra steps.

Bonus points if you want to share how you fixed it - I'm still trying to break the dressing habit without eating sad, dry leaves all day.",2025-08-01 04:23:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1memz30/whats_one_healthy_food_that_secretly_wastes_your/
1mdgmai,loseit,I‚Äôm using Chatgpt to help in my weight loss,"I live with my 2 kids aged 18 and 23, and my 84 year old dad. I‚Äôm 45f and the only obese person in the household (90 kg at 163 cm :/ ). So meal planning is a thing and I usually just make a big lunch and then we eat the same thing for dinner.


I‚Äôve really struggled with counting calories and tracking macros and planning/cooking separate meals for myself so what I‚Äôve started doing is just telling Chatgpt ‚ÄúToday I‚Äôm making pork chops and baked potatoes. Plan my meal around that.‚Äù I already told it I‚Äôm looking for about 1200 kcal per day and about 120g of protein and at least 20g of fiber. 


So it will tell me, have 150g of pork chops and however many grams of potatoes and add this many grams of brussel sprouts and salad greens etc etc.  i have it keep track of everything. So then I go and weigh out whatever it tells me and it just makes my life so much easier. I always have the same thing for breakfast (2 scoops of whey protein + 1 tbsp of chia seeds in 400 ml of skim milk and I add either an apple or a banana and make a smoothie) and it keeps me full until around 6 pm. I‚Äôll eat my meal at around that time, so I‚Äôm skipping lunch I guess but I don‚Äôt miss it.


I also input any exercise (I walk on the treadmill with a weighted vest for 45 minutes to an hour. It‚Äôs less than 10k steps but hopefully I‚Äôll get better at it and stop having debilitating shin splints!!). I‚Äôll tell it how many steps I walked, the speed, the cadence, etc and it will estimate my calories burned based on my TDEE for my weight, age, height, etc. 


At the end of the day if I‚Äôm hungry I‚Äôll just ask it what I can eat out of whatever I have on hand for a snack that will track with my goals and it will give me a few options to choose from. Then when I‚Äôm done for the day it will generate a chart with my macros, calories from food, calories burnt in exercise, etc.


I‚Äôll be doing weekly weigh-ins and it will tweak whatever it needs to as I (hopefully) lose weight and my TDEE changes. 

I‚Äôm really looking forward to this working well as it‚Äôs the easiest way to do it I‚Äôve found so far!

1m5lnpe,loseit,"30M 209lbs, lost 10 pounds in about 2 weeks and now I've been stuck at the same weight","Hi all! 

I have recently started my weight loss journey. I am a stay at home dad and I got a Galaxy Watch to help me log my daily exercise & calories. For about 6 years I've been overweight at about 219lbs, but I finally found a medication that helped me get out of bed and motivated me (Adderall) so I've been starting a much healthier lifestyle. 

For reference I am only 5'7"" and 30 years old

Calorie intake is usually around 1300-1500 a day now

In two weeks, on this same regime, I have lost 10 lbs. I have been waking up early and having a light breakfast (organic banana & granola bar or small fat free yogurt cup)
and throughout my day I typically only drink water, and have one somewhat large meal per day, usually chicken and rice or something similar. My snacking is usually fruit or granola bar or dry bran flakes or something similar. I also exercise daily, but the intensity varies between my free time. I get at least 20-30 mins of cardio, stretching and abs. Some days I do a varying program of resistance, strength and balance training. I go to bed around 11pm every night and I usually don't eat for atleast 2 hours before bed.

I did recently buy a Nutri-bullet blender and every morning I'll be doing a smoothie with organic berries, spinach, super food greens powder, protein powder, almond milk, organic nonfat yogurt, and cherry juice. I will be starting to drink that daily tomorrow (my brother recommended it, he's a physical trainer and has it everyday, said it would be a great way to get in my protein & fiber intake for the day)

The problem is the last week the scale has not moved, been stuck at 209.5lbs. I feel I am still overweight, because of my genetics almost all of my weight is in my gut and chest. I have somewhat muscular legs, arms, and shoulders. 

Is this normal? Or does anyone know what might be happening here? I've seen some stuff about the fact that I might be gaining muscle at a similar rate of losing fat, or water weight, I just feel like I was making a lot of progress and it stopped pretty suddenly. I really want to get under 200 as my first benchmark. I love reading everyone's stories and tips on here. Thanks so much for reading and your time!

2. Strawberry Banana Smoothie ‚Äì Around 210 calories with roughly 17‚Äì19g of protein. I'm hesitant to choose this again because I suspect dairy might make my face puffier or bloated, and it also takes a bit more time to prepare.

Lunch was salmon with half an avocado, an egg, tomato and feta cheese. Dinner was salmon fried in lots of butter, potatoes, sauce and tomatoes. I ate a lot of that salmon cause she really wanted me too, like twice what she ate. And the smoothie was banana, strawberries and milk. Also drank two glasses of wine. 

It‚Äôs not the most unhealthy food (except maybe the wine), though it‚Äôs all pretty calorie dense. And it‚Äôs not like I binged alone to handle my emotions, I ate the food my grandma cooked me. Still feel pretty shitty though. I don‚Äôt even want to begin to think about how many calories this is. Guess it‚Äôs fasting tomorrow and on Sunday for me.

Calorie deficit of 1500 a day (which I even went over a couple days) with extra walking. I walk on my work breaks for half an hour, and I have started to walk to work. Slower progress in the walks is still progress!

Been enjoying the meal prepping I have been doing more then expected. My dad cooks for me, and he usually makes pretty large portions and doesn't always cook the healthiest things (yesterday he served a JUICY steak for example) but I have been doing well on the portioning of my breakfasts and lunches so that balances everything out pretty well :))))

AND I have managed to nearly ditch my snacking habit cold-turkey! I occasionally reach for a bowl of yoghurt, homemade fruit and spinach smoothie or a small yoghurt ice cream after dinner, but I haven't touched any crisps or (mostly) haven't had candy since I started and I am not really missing it.

1lo215u,loseit,"I went from 64kg to 55kg, whilst retaining most of my muscle. Here is what helped me.","Hi everyone,

I'm a short guy (30M, 5ft, 5in), and I've always wanted to be \~15% body fat all my life, cause no one likes a short chubby guy (haha).. 2 years ago, I used to weigh 75kg. I started to do a lot of cardio (running or climbing 60 floors everyday). I went from 75 to 64k in 1 year doing this, and then it plateaued. No matter how much cardio i did, i would not go below 64kg.. nothing worked.

I was also getting tired of doing the same cardio every day. Then i listened to a friend and started to gym (lifting weights, something i had never done before). Over there, everyone told me to do my weekly diet planning, and thats the only way to loose weight properly. Cardio is for heart and lungs health, whilst lifting weight is for retaining and growing muscle.

So i started on a diet plan, and it worked like magic! In 5 months, im now down to 55kg (17% body fat). I did loose some muscle, but very little (mainly cause of lifting weights and eating high protein) I feel awesome, and healthy as ever. I no longer fall sick every month.. it's great. So i just want to share my weakly meal plan with you all.. maybe someone will benefit.

The macros are:

\- A weekly calorie deficit of 3,295 kCal

\- High protein (average protein of 81.7g per day, which is good enough for my weight)

\- Vegetarian

\- If you want this plan in more detail, please DM me. I'd be happy to share the PDF with you (this group did not allow me to post with a link)

I‚Äôm 21yrs old, female, 5‚Äô4 and currently 134lbs.
My goal weight for now is 125, but eventually 120.
I come from a family with really good genetics and I‚Äôve always been naturally lean and never weighed more than 122lbs, until this past year I stopped being active.
I now go to the gym at least 5x a week, sometimes more because I also work there.
I do 60 minutes of cardio 5-7x a week at a 5% incline, 2.4 - 2.7mph. And I also do weight lifting at least 4x a week, usually 5x.

My maintenance is 2,194 calories and I have chosen to do a 375 deficit and consume 1,819 a day or less.
I naturally burn between 1,400 to 1,600 calories a day and then my active calories is 400+ each day. But I at least make sure to always burn more than I eat.

I‚Äôve been eating the same things everyday: steak & potatoes, yogurt, protein chip nachos, frozen fruit, and smoothies.

I‚Äôm looking for different meals or even snacks to eat.
The meals would need to contain either chicken or beef since I do not eat any other kinds of meat. 
I‚Äôm hoping for more filling meals that are higher in nutrients.

I just bumped my calories up to 1750 from 1550 because I don't think I was eating enough. I'm currently 207 pounds and 5'5"". I eat pretty clean - most days for breakfast and lunch I have a giant smoothie with greek yogurt, almond milk, oats, raspberris, apples, passion fruit, pineapple, pumpkin seeds and 1T peanut butter. For dinner I have either salmon, squid or shrimp and couscous with some feta. That comes out to 150 grams of protein, 175 grams of carbs, 56 grams of fat and 20 grams of fiber. I power walk for 25 minutes per day, don't drink alcohol, lots of water, sleep 9 hours a night and two cups of black coffee. 

My weight loss has slowed to about 3 pounds a month and I am beyond hungry. What do I need to change? More fiber? More carbs? Less protein? Veggies? I think I'm going to start lifting weights but I'm afraid that will make me hungrier and will slow my weight loss even more since muscle weighs more than fat.

1limle1,loseit,Lost 100+ Pounds and then Nothing for 8 Months,"37F | 5'4"" | Starting Weight: 290.0 | Lowest Weight: 172.6 | Current Weight: 186.6 | Goal Weight: 145.0



I've struggled with my weight my entire life, and gained around 100 pounds from a medication I was on in my early 20s.  I'm one of those people that lost and gained the same 30-40 pounds multiple times, but nothing ever ""stuck.""  About 2 years ago, after being diagnosed with multiple auto-immune and arthritis-based conditions, I was basically desperate to do anything to try to feel better and reduce the pain/inflammation, so I started by focusing on whole foods, then walking daily, then following an anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet.  After a few months, I also started going to physical therapy multiple times a week and doing quite a bit of resistance training.



For the first time in my life, weight loss was actually easy!  I routinely lost at least 5-10 pounds a month, and ended up losing nearly 120 pounds in about 15 months.  Then in October it just completely stopped.  At first, I wasn't particularly concerned because I knew I would probably hit a plateau at some point.  I had also recently changed physical therapy providers and was lifting heavier weights so I thought that could be part of it.  While I don't totally trust my body comp scale, it seemed to think I had gained 3 or 4 pounds of muscle so when I was weighing a few pounds heavier, I didn't mind as long as it was muscle.  I hung out around 175 for a couple of months and since it was Thanksgiving/Christmas and we traveled for several weeks, I wasn't being strict about tracking calories or anything and planned to basically make a push to lose the rest of the weight after the first of the year.



January came and I became more focused on weight loss again, started tracking again, upped my walking, all the things, and nothing happened.  Not only did I not lose any more weight, I was slowly starting to fluctuate up into the higher 170s.  Around April, I started seeing weights in the low 180s again.  After a last-minute cross-country trip at the end of May for a funeral, I came back home and the scale was 196.6.  I freaked out about the prospect of being over 200 again, so for the last 3 weeks, I've been incredibly on track.  I tend to get very inflammed when traveling, and I did drop the 12 pounds or so I was up within a few days.  But despite doing all the ""right things,"" I'm just not being able to budge from the mid-180s.



I have historically used MyFitnessPal, but I switched to LoseIt last week.  I track and weigh/measure everything.  I drink a ton of water (about 1.5 gallons a day).  I do pretty well with my protein goals and great with fiber.  I have been very strict about my anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet as far as no added sugar, tons of vegetables, only lean protein, no red meat, a good amount of beans, etc.  A typical day is a smoothie for breakfast with something like strawberries/blueberries, lots of spinach, and pea protein, usually a bowl for lunch with something like chicken/shrimp, zucchini, beans, and rice, and normally something like fish with a couple of veggies for dinner.  I'm not a big snacker, I usually have a coffee with Fairlife milk in the morning and possibly an Oikos Triple Zero yogurt in the afternoon, before or after physical therapy.



As far as exercise, I live in southern Arizona and temps have been 110+ lately, so walking outdoors has mostly not been an option, but I do typically ride my exercise bike 4-5 times a week.  I also have physical therapy twice a week where I do strength training both with resistance bands and weights.  I usually do additional sessions of that at home throughout the week.  In other seasons of the year, I typically walk 5-6 days a week and hike 1-2 a week.  I have been considering purchasing a walking pad to use during the hot summer months.



I've worked with a dietician for almost 2 years since just a few months into this weight loss journey.  For a variety of reasons (mostly TMJ-related easting restrictions and then a serious bout of gastritis), there were times when my ability and desire to eat were affected so eating 1200-1300 calories was about all I could manage, but for the majority of my weight loss, I was eating more like 1500 calories.  When my weight loss plateaued, my dietician initially suggested eating more like 1800 calories, but I feel like that's when I started gaining from 175ish back up to 185ish.  I tried going back to around 1500 calories, but that didn't seem to move the needle either.  



When I joined LoseIt, they suggested eating around 1350 Monday-Thursday and 1550 Friday-Sunday based on the parameters I provided.  I tried that last week and that was fine, I averaged about 1440 calories (with exercise the average was 1200) and felt satiated for the most part, but I actually ended up gaining weight!  It's so frustrating to me because I'm typically able to eat 100% at home Monday-Thursday and the scale will start trending down, but then the second I eat away from the home, I gain it all back and more.  I obviously try to limit eating out, but the reality is that it is going to happen 2-3 times a week when I'm socializing with friends.  Thursday night I attended a potluck, but I was incredibly mindful about what I ate.  I brought chicken breast and a broccoli salad where I'd have something lean to eat.  I only got one small plate.  I had pre-tracked calories before I arrived to know how much to get.  Same thing Friday when my husband and I went out to dinner.  I picked a healthier option, I knew exactly what I was going to order, only ate half, tracked everything.  And then Saturday I hosted a party, but same thing, was really mindful, stuck to the light options, really ate slowly and listened to hunger cues.  And after all of that, to be up almost a pound and a half versus down the pound and a half I should have been is just so incredibly frustrating.



I recognize that the higher sodium in foods outside the home probably account for my weight being up and that it may drop again in the next couple of days, but I'm just so tired of feeing like I'm stuck in this cycle of thinking I'm losing again and then it just going right back up.  I know that I'm working against my body as far as inflammation and that I do have physical limitations that prevent me from more aggressive forms of exercise, but I just feel like something is ""wrong"" at this point.  My dietician doesn't seem to understand my level of frustration, my therapist seems to think I should just accept that this is my new ""set point,"" and my husband thinks I'm massively overreacting since I'm literally 100+ pounds smaller than I was.  But now that I'm smaller, every extra ounce seems to go straight to my stomach and I'm so tired of feeling like I look like I swallowed a basketball.  I've worked so hard to just feel like I never look good in clothes or to feel like I'm still the biggest girl in photos.



And I'd be lying if I said I don't care about aesthetics/appearance, but really and truly, it is more about my health to  me.  With all of the health problems and diagnoses, I ended up developing high blood pressure and I desperately want to get to the point that I'm able to discontinue those medications.  I also want to do everything I can to limit extra weight and stress on my joints.  I also don't want doctors to ever be able to use my weight as an excuse of why I'm in pain or things like that.  I also know menopause my not be far around the corner, so I just very much feel like now is the time to lose the rest of the weight as I know it will likely only get harder the older I get and the more my medical conditions progress.



I know that's a lot, but what can I do to lose another 40 pounds?  I feel like I've tried everything.  I keep trying to get to the bottom of what changed and the thing is there's a million variables.  Around the time my weight loss stalled, I had quite a bit of medication changes.  I had to discontinue my Celebrex (NSAID) due to the gastritis not healing, so it stands to reason inflammation is a bigger challenge (though last time my inflammation markers were checked they were in the normal range for the first time ever).  As my gastritis healed, I was able to come off my high dose of Omeprazole and also decreased my Famotidine and I do think those had an impact on my appetite.  Also with the gastritis, I had to discontinue some of my anti-inflammatory supplements like Turmeric and Vitamin D.  Also last fall, I found out I was extremely anemic so I did have to do a round of high-dose Iron, but that has now corrected itself and is back in the normal range.  I also had an unsuccessful procedure to get steroid injections in my SI joints in October and then surgery to remove an endometrial polyp back in December.



I'm just really at a loss as to what the issue is.  I eat so clean and I focus so much on whole foods, that I just don't know what more improvements I can make at this point.  I personally believe that things are not always as simple as CICO, but at the same time, the ""math is just not mathing"" at this point.

1lhfzwh,loseit,My mom can‚Äôt loose weight no matter what she tries.,"My mom is 50 years old and around 300 pounds. She needs to get knee replacement surgery but her doctor said she need to loose the weight first. 

The thing is, we can‚Äôt figure out why she isn‚Äôt loosing weight. For the last month she has been tracking her calories religiously. I know for a fact because she makes me check her calories after every meal to make sure there right lol. 

She usually has a jimmy dean‚Äôs breakfast bowl for breakfast, a home made cherry smoothy for lunch, and a meal prepped chicken pasta dish for dinner. She might throw in a protein bar if she‚Äôs hungry between lunch and dinner. Often she only eats 1500-1800 calories a day. 

I‚Äôve also got her doing yoga 3 times a week. 

She‚Äôs went to the doctor and has had all the blood tests done. Her hormones and thyroid are supposedly fine. She‚Äôs has had a hysterectomy but they left one overy in so she could go through menopause. 

Speaking of which, she is going through menopause right now. 

My best guess as to why she can‚Äôt loose the weight is because she‚Äôs going through menopause or because she‚Äôs not getting as much sleep as she should. She has insomnia so she often ales up in the middle of the night, not able to go back to sleep. She refuses to take medication for it though cus my grandma abused it. 

Any ideas as to how I can help her. She feels so defeated. She really has been trying her hardest and tonight she broke down because she‚Äôs still not see progress. 

Any advice or ideas are much appreciated!! 

Edit: For everyone saying she‚Äôs mis counting her calories or sneak food, I promise she‚Äôs not. I have a comment down below of how we tracked the calories for her smoothie and her chicken parm pasta. As for sneaking food, we live together in a rural area. It‚Äôs not easy for her to drive to the store at 10 to get a snack when the store closes her at 6. I also live with her so I‚Äôve gotten to know her eating habits. 

I swear she‚Äôs eating in what should be a calorie deficit, so please give me advice as if she is doing so. ",2025-06-22 05:09:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1lhfzwh/my_mom_cant_loose_weight_no_matter_what_she_tries/
1lgfj3w,loseit,"Am I on the right track? - No progress on scale or measurements, only feeling","Hi, I'm looking for some advice on if I'm on the right track and just need to continue what I'm doing, or if it should adjust some things.

It's been 43 days since I officially started my weight-loss journey, but I noticed I haven't seen any loss in weight on the scale, and not any loss in my body measurements. Am I just impatient or are there things I need to adjust?

Start: 150 lb | 5'2"" F29  
Current: Still 150 lb  
Goal: 115 lb

The only thing I know for certain after having worked out and eat healthy for 43 days is that:

1. I experience more mental clarity everyday.
2. I sleep better everyday.
3. My body feels stronger.
4. I'm getting more flexible, and moving around feels so much easier, the sluggish feeling is gone.
5. My back looks to be firming up just a bit, and so is my upper stomach with that hint of a small single ab line.

The only measurements that changed (everything else like thighs, calf, arms, neck, bust stayed the same):

Measurements at the start:  
Waist 80 cm  
Lower tummy 91 cm

Measurements now:  
Waist 78 cm  
Lower tummy 88 cm

Current lifestyle:

1. No alcohol consumption
2. Switched coffee to matcha (good for my mental health and clarity)
3. No social media consumption
4. workout 6x/wk. I prioritized building a workout schedule that optimized for fun and enjoyment.
   1. Sunday - Rest |  Monday - HIIT | Tuesday - Zumba | Wednesday - Yoga | Thursday - HIIT | Friday Hip Hop Dance | Saturday Lagree
5. Walk 7k daily -- this one I'm still working on experimenting how to make it into a daily habit. I reach it 50% of the time. Usually doing 4k to 7k steps a day.
6. Sleep by 1 AM, Wake at 9 AM. I heard sleep is very important for weight loss and hormonal regulation, among other things. This one I hit about 60% of the time so far.
7. Eat at home everyday unless out with friends once a week. -- this one I haven't been doing so hot. I think it's about 70% right.

For meals:

Homemade Brunch is always the same:  
\- unsweetened matcha latte - This week I recently switched from oat milk to almond milk to decrease sugars and calories.  
\- protein-heavy egg avocado toast - This week I switched from fried egg with olive oil to using boiled egg instead to decrease calories. I also add hemp seeds and use Dave's Killer 21 Grain bread that has 6g protein per slice.

Homemade recovery 12-16 oz smoothie is always the same:  
\- 1 banana

\- 7-9 strawberries

\- 1/3 cup of Mikuna Chocho Plant Protein Powder

\- Splash of almond milk

\- Ice

Where I notice my diet slips up more are the less repeatable meals at home, which my mom cooks. Sometimes the family eats at home -- in that case I think i can try to improve my portion sizing to be smaller. But other times our family gets take-out or eats at home 2-3 evenings a week and that is harder to measure.

I use the Ate App to track my food because I don't have the best mental detachment to be able to count macros or anything. So I focus on intuitive and mindful eating and just trying to adjust my lifestyle bit by bit so it can be as enjoyable and automatic as possible.

Should I just continue as is? Am I on the right track and maybe there will be a ""whoosh"" effect of weightloss at the end of Month 2 or Month 3? Am I being impatient?

Especially as a woman, I imagine our bodies are more complex so many the weight loss timeline looks a bit different and I just need to keep doing what I'm doing and weight longer?

I was hoping at this point to have at least 1-2 pounds down to give me some sign or motivation I'm losing weight. My clothes still don't fit.

1le320s,loseit,Has anyone else really fine tuned their meal sizes and timing? I like a big lunch,"I am very active as a stay at home mom, and as I‚Äôm settling more into my status as a mom of two (second baby is 13 months old, first is 3), I‚Äôve fine tuned my meals in a way that really works for me now. I am very active, currently getting 15,000 steps a day, and playing with my kids a lot (swinging them around, pushing them in a double stroller at least once a day), so I burn through a lot of calories. 

I don‚Äôt like to feel like I‚Äôm restricting my main meals too much, so I usually skip breakfast, so I have a huge appetite at lunch. Occasionally I will have a small morning smoothie if I‚Äôm tired, but more I‚Äôve been pushing to lunch. So I have space for a 1100 calorie lunch. Obviously this is ridiculously big for many people, especially losing weight, but oh my do I need the calories.

A lot of people say you should eat just before fullness in general and particularly when losing weight, but for me I‚Äôve found to eat slightly past fullness at lunch so I have ample energy. And even then, I will have a 170 calorie smoothie at about 3 pm. As lunch is at about 12:00, I can‚Äôt make it to dinner at 5:45 easily being so active.

Then since I had an afternoon little smoothie, and mentally I know my day is ending and my activity is slowing down, I will have a much smaller dinner, and will be more intentional with eating slowly as I eat (often from necessity anyway, as I‚Äôm usually cutting up bits of meat to give to my hungry children lol), and will eat a little before fullness. I also have a little low calorie (35 calorie) peanut butter patty after dinner as I‚Äôm doing the dishes, so it helps knowing I will get a little treat too. 

A lot of these things I‚Äôve done since I‚Äôve started losing weight again postpartum 7 months ago, but some subtle things I‚Äôve adjusted, and my thoughts behind meal sizes and timing.

I had a maintenance break a few weeks ago, which seemed to have effected my resting heart rate to go higher (it‚Äôs finally going back to my calorie deficit normal) so my weekly weight loss isn‚Äôt clear from what I‚Äôve recently changed (as a month ago, my baby was still nursing, so I was still having a morning smoothie), but I think I‚Äôm losing a pound a week now, which is great for being so close to goal, and I can eat so much food doing it!

I am a really analytical person, and I‚Äôve really found my zone and figured out what has worked for me. I‚Äôd love to hear what you‚Äôve fine tuned with your meals and timing!",2025-06-18 00:07:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1le320s/has_anyone_else_really_fine_tuned_their_meal/
1l838ad,loseit,One Year In: Slow but Steady Results (InBody Data),"It has been one year since I have really been able to lock in on my wellness habits. Below is my InBody scan tracking for the year. While I know it is not a perfect measure, it is consistent and provides data beyond the scale. 



||Jun 2024|Aug 2024|Nov 2024|Jun 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Weight (lb)|239.8|233.0|226.7|226.6|
|SMM (lb)|94.1|95.5|94.4|98.3|
|PBF (%)|31.3|28.2|27.3|24.3|



In a year I have only lost just about 15 lbs. But I have gained 4 lbs of muscle and reduced my body fat % significantly. I feel amazing, and my fitness level is 100 times better. I have also dropped a size or two in my waist so while I am still heavier than I want to be, this is trending in the right direction and creating a foundation for who I want to be the rest of my life.

  
What is really making the difference to me to be is consistent, sustainable habits that are achievable in the day to day life. 

I have practiced my good habits *most of the time*. I tend to binge eat when stressed, so I have been focusing on reducing stress and keeping a routine that can do so. I am trying to eat clean but eat things I like. High protein breakfasts like breakfast tacos, Costco egg bites, high protein smoothies. Incorporating lots of fruits and veggies where I can. Lots of diet soda and seltzers. I have also significantly reduced my drinking, which has added to the flywheel effect to health.

Fitness has really been trying to follow the basics: two days a week of strength training, 4 days of cardio either walking/peloton spin/running, and yoga on rest days. All things I like and things I am consistent with.

While I've been doing well, some days I don't. Some days I overeat and land in same old bad habits, and it happens on average slightly less than once a week. But I have been very happy, just enjoying the process, the results, how I feel, and being patient on the weight reduction. It doesn't feel impossible, it is just taking time. 

Looking forward to progress made next year.

I‚Äôm 8 months postpartum so I‚Äôm trying to eat enough and workout but I want to lose weight. It‚Äôs SO hard.

I don‚Äôt know how I got here with my morning routine because I used to be so good at just waking up and doing my workout. But now I cannot just wake up and workout - I NEED something to eat and like ASAP after I wake up because I am starving. But it also takes me awhile to wake up, I‚Äôm very much NOT a morning person. And I bring this up because cooking an omelette each morning is not feasible for me with how hungry I am or my morning routine - so looking for ideas.

Specially, I want to break my protein bar habit and maybe my smoothie habit? I like a smoothie because I get fruit and I add collagen which I like but I don‚Äôt like the flavor without some sort of added flavor hence the liquid IV.

I try to wake up about 6:15 and then I need to eat quick, and then get my workout in around 6:45/7 am so I can get my workout done and then nurse my baby, get her down for her morning nap, and start working at 8am. It‚Äôs hard.

So I need breakfast ideas that are quick and healthy and then a post workout meal that will help me break my habits.

1kz84tz,loseit,Weigh your oils ü´íü•ëü••,"I have a smoothie for breakfast and lunch every day, and put 10 g of extra virgin olive oil in each, which is about 88 calories (yes, it tastes really good). 

Today, I decided to measure using a tbsp while weighing just to see the difference. 10 g of extra virgin olive oil is more than 1 tbsp (1 tbsp is 7 g).

According to the Google, one US tablespoon of water weighs approximately 14.79 grams. A US tablespoon is equivalent to 14.79 milliliters (ml), and since the density of water is close to 1 gram per milliliter, the conversion is straightforward.

If you search ""how many grams of oil is in one tablespoon,"" the immediate answer will be, ""one US tablespoon of oil weighs approximately 13 grams."" However, water is denser than oil, so for the same volume, water weighs significantly more than oil, which is why 1 tbsp of any given oil will weigh much less than one 1 tbsp of water (and in the case of extra virgin olive oil, it's about half). 

In addition to that, different oils have different weights per volume, so 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil weighs less than 1 tbsp of coconut oil. According to the Google, ""a gallon of olive oil weighs approximately 7.6 lbs, while a gallon of avocado oil weighs around 8 lbs, and a gallon of coconut oil weighs about 8.15 lbs."" 

So, weigh your oil, and when calculating using a calorie tracking app, use grams not mls.  

In my case, if I only measured, I wouldn't be consuming enough calories or fat in a day.

1ky4nzh,loseit,Finally losing the weight without hating my life. Here's what worked for me,"I always had a shitty relationship with food and thinness. Grew up during the early 2000s and ended up unintentionally associating thinness with beauty, so no matter how I looked I never felt thin enough. In hindsight, though, I was. And I learned this by actually packing up the pounds after getting pregnant. 

I have about 40 pounds to lose to get back to my goal weight. I started out 3 weeks ago and managed to drop 8 so far. Unlike the other times I dieted, this time it all feels easy. I am very tall and am also breastfeeding, so I decided to cut to about 1800 kcal a day. Had 2 cheat meals and that was it. I plan to keep going until I drop 20, pause for a week, and then move on with what's left.  

Unlike the other times I dieted - where I hated every moment of it - this time it I decided to ditch the whole weight loss narrative and actually figure out what works for me as I go. Here's what made a difference:

- the hell with 'tHiS Is a LiFeSTylE and not a QuiCk Fix'. every time I tried to diet in the past I saw it as this insurmountable task that would leave me without my favorite foods, forever. I already ate pretty healthy so this approach basically meant that I would have to cut out a weekly fast-food meal and sugar. the idea of that made me miserable. so this time I am choosing to look at it as something TEMPORARY. I will diet for X months and then get on with my life. I trust my future self to figure out how to incorporate my favorite things back into my diet without gaining weight. If this means doing OMAD once a week so I can eat out, or skipping a meal so I can have some pie, so be it. And this should not be too hard because I learned that...
- it all has to do with how you relate to hunger. If you manage to be ok with feeling hungry, and understand that it's nothing more than a sensation, you will be able to stick to your meal plan. Hunger is just hunger, you are not starving, and, provided you are overweight, your body has a shit ton of extra storage it can tap into so you keep functioning. Be ok with being hungry. This mentality has single-handedly  changed my approach to weight loss. 
- absolute favorite foods are a no-no because you won't be able to stop eating. keep them out of you plan until you hit your goal weight. for me, this means no home made bread with butter or cakes in the house. think of Greg Doucette's circle theory. 'everything in moderation' is a shit approach for people who tend to overeat. 
- I love to drink my calories. I got a blender and I make smoothies as a sweet treat and pair them with a salad for lunch. I always ran away from smoothies because they supposedly were not filling enough. That is wrong. The hell with that advice. 
- Coffee can postpone a meal for about 2 hours if you drink it hot, and about one hour if you drink it cold. Add milk, use sweetener, and voila - luxurious lattes at 50kcals a piece. 
- Soups are great - filling, nutritious and, if you know how to cook them, delicious. Eat a lot of soups. 
- unpopular opinion, but be hard on yourself. stay accountable and disciplined. you'll have plenty of time to focus on your satiety and dopamine hits after you manage to lose the weight and tend to your physical wellbeing. it's ok to feel discomfort, don't run away from it. 

Hope this stuff helps. If you disagree, that's absolutely fine, we all get to decide what works for us in the end. 

If you have any other weight loss advice, please share!

good luck to all!

1kut2rs,loseit,"Why artificial sweeteners can cause you to gain weight, and why it might be news to you!","Edit: I 100% admit that the title is misleading!  I am so glad someone called me out on that. I honestly apologize as it was not my intent to be clickbait. It should say: artificial sweeteners can prevent healthy weight loss, or create unwanted fat development. It can cause weight gain indirectly in a variety of ways listed and detailed. It was an unintended oversight and it overjoys me that Reddit peer review called me out on it. My apologies! 

I tried commenting on a previous post but was late, so I thought this might help some of you!  I am kinda a career student, with a BS in biology, EMT, 20 years of experience in pharmacy compounding as a CPhT, almost finished a Chemical Engineering degree, and I‚Äôm currently an RRT on the way to APRT.  I‚Äôve also done lots of research as a volunteer lab assistant at UNCC in the biology department, and have been credited in minor ways on several academic papers I helped write. 

At the same time I‚Äôve lost over 175 lbs over the last 9 years or so, but that was a former post if you care to look. I wanted to weigh in on something that comes up a lot: artificial sweeteners and weight gain.

There have been multiple studies showing correlations between artificial sweeteners and increased fat storage or weight gain ‚Äî even when calories stay the same. The results, however, are inconsistent and often hard to reproduce. So, it‚Äôs not totally settled science, but here‚Äôs the basic theory in ‚ÄúELI5‚Äù terms:

When you taste something sweet, even if it‚Äôs calorie-free like an artificial sweetener, your brain and body respond as if it‚Äôs real sugar. Your body starts priming itself metabolically ‚Äî releasing insulin, adjusting glucose uptake, and preparing to store energy. If there aren‚Äôt actually any calories to process, the system can get out of sync, and one possible outcome is that your body still shifts toward storing energy, especially in fat cells, as a kind of ‚Äúbetter safe than sorry‚Äù mechanism.

So the theory is: your body may start storing more fat without a calorie surplus, simply because it‚Äôs reacting to sweet taste as a signal of energy abundance. That physiological response is very real ‚Äî we just don‚Äôt fully understand its long-term effects or exactly how consistent it is across different people or sweeteners.

But here‚Äôs where it gets messy: funding bias.

Studies showing negative effects of artificial sweeteners are usually funded by public universities or non-profit institutions. On the other hand, industry-funded studies ‚Äî think Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and companies that produce sweeteners or diet foods ‚Äî tend to show the opposite: no weight gain, no metabolic disruption, nothing to see here.

And while funding sources are technically disclosed in papers, they‚Äôre not always obvious. You won‚Äôt see, ‚ÄúThis study disproving weight gain from diet soda was funded by Coca-Cola.‚Äù Instead, it‚Äôll say something like:
‚ÄúSupported by the Art Vandalay Institute of Health and Architecture.‚Äù (Okay, I made that name up.)
But if you dig into who funds that institute, you might find donors connected to the food or beverage industry ‚Äî maybe even family members of executives.

This kind of indirect funding creates plausible deniability, but it‚Äôs a known tactic. And it‚Äôs not a conspiracy ‚Äî just capitalism working in science. It‚Äôs happened before.

If you were around in the ‚Äò80s or ‚Äò90s, you probably remember the massive ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù diet craze. Everyone avoided fat like it was poison, because ‚Äúfat makes you fat,‚Äù right? But nobody cared much about sugar or calories. That messaging didn‚Äôt just happen by accident ‚Äî it was heavily influenced by agricultural industries, especially corn. Farmers needed corn prices to stay high, so keeping demand for corn syrup (aka sugar) high was good business. So research came out framing fat as the villain ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where the spotlight stayed.

In reality, all three macronutrients ‚Äî carbs, protein, and fat ‚Äî can cause weight gain if consumed in excess. They‚Äôre all broken down by your body using enzymes: amylase for carbs, protease for protein, and lipase for fat. At the end of the day, a calorie surplus is a calorie surplus.

Another good example of funding bias? Cannabis policy.

Whether you love it or hate it, the data‚Äôs pretty clear that cannabis legalization leads to lower alcohol use. And guess who‚Äôs not thrilled about that? The alcohol industry. Beer and wine sales have taken a major hit in states where cannabis is legal ‚Äî and so, predictably, alcohol companies are some of the biggest funders of anti-cannabis lobbying and research. Again, not a conspiracy ‚Äî just self-interest.

But! It‚Äôs also important to point out that not all industry-funded research is bad. Take vaccines. Anti-vaxxers often scream about funding bias ‚Äî ‚ÄúBig Pharma funded the study!‚Äù ‚Äî but in reality, pharmaceutical companies have to pay for research in order to prove a vaccine is effective before the FDA will even consider approval.

Yes, that‚Äôs technically a funding bias. And yes, it‚Äôs likely that some researchers cut corners to make results look good. But that‚Äôs why we have institutions like the FDA, which (in theory) re-runs these trials independently to verify results before approving anything for the public. Is the system perfect? No. But it‚Äôs designed to minimize the risks of bad science getting through unchecked.

‚∏ª

Anecdotally, in my own weight loss journey, I noticed that I lost weight more effectively after I stopped relying on ‚Äúdiet‚Äù sodas and unsweetened tea with Splenda. I didn‚Äôt have much of a sweet tooth to begin with, so I eventually switched to an occasional regular soda or just half-cut sweet tea ‚Äî and things improved. It might‚Äôve just been coincidence or changes in appetite and habits, but I felt better and saw results.

So if you‚Äôre drinking a ton of diet drinks and feeling stuck, it might be worth experimenting. It‚Äôs not about blaming artificial sweeteners or panicking about them ‚Äî but your body‚Äôs response might not be what you think it is.

A few final points, not all artificial sweeteners behave the same! For instance, sucralose is a ‚Äúsugar alcohol‚Äùmolecularly, it is very similar to sucrose or table sugar. But it has an -OH tacked on it that makes it an alcohol and therefore does not get metabolized as a sugar. Instead it theoretically passes right through us and is never broken down to glucose. Sucralose and saccharin are pretty well known to stimulate insulin and disrupt metabolism. Aspartame is different though, while it is the worst tasting artificial sweetener in my opinion, it‚Äôs kinda just a random chemical that happens to taste sweet.  It seems to have almost no effect on metabolism. Also when these sweeteners send your body into energy storage mode, it is using the actual energy that you did eat to create adipose (fat) cells, energy you probably planned on using to work, exercise, breathe, sleep‚Ä¶. If you are actively dieting, and are at a calorie deficit but heavily using sweeteners, you might be experiencing fatigue, AND weight gain because some of the few calories you did consume are being used to make adipose tissue and not for energy. This can create a wonderful nightmare of being hungry all the time, gaining weight, and constantly feeling fatigue. It can also create such an energy shortage in the body due to your calorie deficit, that your body start to metabolize muscle tissue for its protein, while actively using what you ate for adipose production.  You do not ever want this and it is why doctors will tell you to try not to lose more than 8-10 lbs a month (1 kg a week for the rest of the world). 

Anyways I just wanted to share a bit of knowledge and hope it helps someone else who‚Äôs trying to figure out why their ‚Äúmath‚Äù isn‚Äôt adding up in the weight loss game. Always question the data ‚Äî and always check who‚Äôs funding the research.

Edit:  Wow ‚Äî a lot of people got really upset at this post and demanded sources, claiming it was misinformation. So I took the time to respond with studies from both sides of the argument ‚Äî including research that supports and questions artificial sweeteners. Within 30 minutes, many of the loudest critics deleted their comments and downvoted the sources and the post.

I‚Äôm not here to ban anyone‚Äôs diet soda. I‚Äôm just pointing out, in plain language, why artificial sweeteners may not always support long-term weight loss, especially if they reinforce cravings and disrupt metabolic signals. I even backed that up with peer-reviewed science ‚Äî not TikToks, not fear-mongering.

If the reaction is this intense just for asking questions backed by evidence, maybe it‚Äôs not that the science is wrong ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs that the implications are uncomfortable. And that‚Äôs exactly why we should be talking about it.


EDIT PART DUEX:
Honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get dogpiled for this. I figured I was presenting a balanced take‚Äîone that multiple studies support‚Äîbut apparently suggesting that maybe Diet Mountain Dew isn‚Äôt a free metabolic miracle is like kicking someone‚Äôs emotional support raccoon.

To be clear:
I‚Äôm not anti-artificial sweeteners. I consume a ton of them. I drink 2‚Äì3 commercial low-calorie protein shakes a day, and those things are basically Splenda smoothies with a side of whey. But I only use them when there‚Äôs justified nutrition involved‚Äîlike protein, fiber, or something that‚Äôs part of a real meal. I don‚Äôt sweeten plain tea. I don‚Äôt slam diet sodas. Not because I think they‚Äôre evil, but because for me, chasing sweetness without substance tends to backfire.

And that‚Äôs the point. Sweetness‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs from sugar or sweeteners‚Äîis a physiological addiction. It lights up your dopamine system the same way nicotine or heroin does. We just get to pretend it‚Äôs fine because it comes in a 0-calorie can with a NASCAR logo on it. But your body doesn‚Äôt know the difference between ‚Äútastes like sugar‚Äù and ‚Äúis sugar‚Äù‚Äîit preps for the incoming carbs either way. That disconnect can mess with hunger cues, insulin responses, and long-term weight loss.

I wasn‚Äôt trying to steal your soda. I was just pointing out that if your plan hinges on hacking biology, you should understand how the system you‚Äôre hacking actually works. If that makes me the villain, fine. I‚Äôll be over here drinking my Splenda-laced protein shake and minding my own dopamine receptors.",2025-05-25 03:27:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kut2rs/why_artificial_sweeteners_can_cause_you_to_gain/
1kusyxf,loseit,protein shake intake for weight loss??,"Hello all.

I've recently made a decision to take my life back and start losing weight. I'm currently 31 years old (32 in 2 months) 6'2 and 390 lbs. My current workout is walking 1.5 miles on a treadmill and starting some weight lifting for muscle. I've seem some videos about doing diets that ONLY have protein shakes and seeing massive results.

I know that's not a long term plan but I came on here to ask what recommendations for me as I currently dont have access to a doctor nor a clinic or nutritionist.

My current breakfast is 4 days with overnight oats (2 percent milk, rolled oats, chia seeds, greek yogurt, a small amount of peanut butter and maple syrup) I usually have a lake and berry smoothie for lunch and for dinner is whatever i can find at home, but only in small amounts, which i am currently learning about.

thanks for any help

1kcqmi8,loseit,"How to Make a Delicious, Low-Calorie Smoothie (Only 200 Calories!)","With summer right around the corner, smoothies, slushies, and other cold treats can be super tempting! I've seen people mention 1200-1400 calorie diets, so I wanted to share a simple smoothie hack that‚Äôs seriously low-calorie and doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre dieting.

What you'll need:  
A Blender  
Fruit (That matches the flavor of the water) (I used frozen mango, pineapple, (1) banana and strawberry.) It should total 1-1.5 cups of fruit not including the banana  
1 12 oz Flavored Sparking water (I used Pineapple coconut LaCroix). I know some people don‚Äôt love sparkling water, but you really can't taste it.  
Honey (optional, for sweetness, however not needed )  
Salt a small dash-really brings out flavor!

Smoothies can add up quickly in calories, especially depending on what you put in them. But I recently discovered this hack that‚Äôs been a total game-changer for me, and I wanted to share it with you all!

Instructions:

1. Pour your sparkling water, fruit and a small dash of salt into a blender, blend low gradually increasing the speed so it doesn't overflow, blend until smooth and pour.

This hack gives you an 14oz smoothie for just about 200 calories and has helped me stick to my goals and curb cravings!",2025-05-02 02:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kcqmi8/how_to_make_a_delicious_lowcalorie_smoothie_only/

1k8btq1,loseit,I think this is what long-term success and freedom looks like. 128>115kg.,"I stepped on the scale today for the first time after coming back from a vacation with my family.

And I'm 115kg. 

4.5kg down from March 31st when I left. 


And when I checked my body comp on my watch it shows the lowest body fat I've seen in years, with an increase in muscle. I still lost weight despite a week of Easter holiday filled with high calorie foods. 

I was strict for the first 2 weeks of vacation. Meticulously counted every calorie. Mostly veggies and low glycemic fruits and obviously protein. I was maintaining my routine. 
Every single time I've ever gone back home to Europe I always start off addict and eventually all the pastries and high carb foods catch up and I gain. 

The week of Easter I let myself eat at maintenance. 

I'm still obese. BMI 40 or so. But I knew even on the plane that I would be jumping back into being in a deficit as soon as I get home. 

This is freedom. 

- Not obsessing over food, nutrition,  and whether my next meal is going to be sufficient. 

- Feeling a bit peckish at the airport and not settling for crappy food. Waiting until I find something I actually want to eat. Not fretting over  if my blood sugar levels are going to randomly drop and frantically filling up my stomach. 


- I went through my closet and I had a bit of a grieving process for all the clothes that are soon going to be too big. 

I started this journey in February. 128.3 kg at 170cm/5'7. 

I was in the midst of an unending binge cycle and couldn't go an entire day without sweets or fast food of some sort. Dairy milk with mini eggs was my favorite treat and sometimes I'd eat 3 in a row. those things were 270kcal each!!

 No hunger cues/fullness signals. I'd eat till I felt sick. And I definitely ate all my emotions away. Sad, happy, stressed? Always a reason to treat myself. 

Now? 

Two weeks ago I had a very upsetting quarrel with my dad and I actively sought to calm myself before continuing my dinner , rather than eating my feelings away. 

Before I was also was a foodie perfectionist. I once read the Gabriel method (big mistake) and I swear it was my downfall. It was pretty much intuitive eating in a fancy box. It's main premise was to eat what you want but just add super nutritious things to it so that you're fuller faster and learn to enjoy the taste of healthy food. 

Sorry but that doesn't work with binge eating disorder and ADHD.

It only took me 15 years to realise I'd been fucking myself over. 

My main method to maintain my obesity was 16hr fasts followed by super nutritious huge portions of food along with anything I wanted. 

So imagine 4 slices of pizza but you also make a giant salad to go with it. Nuts seeds nutritional yeast popcorn cucumbers, tomatos, peppers , eggs sauerkraut. Followed by a blueberry and kefir protein smoothie with peanut butter. 

I would feel like dying and need to lie down. Then an hour or two later I'd be hungry again.

I was eating as if I was a body builder but only doing cardio. It wasn't sustainable because I never had fullness cues so in the event of treating myself eventually I'd turn to junk food. 

I originally lost 50lbs 12 years ago by doing one meal a day. That was my happiest time and I remembered feeling always satisfied with my food choices and lifestyle so I thought fasting was my ultimate method. I was younger, my body functioned differently and my first few weeks consisted of one frozen pizza, a KitKat and a cottage cheese for a total of 1200kcal. 


Then in the middle of this giant paradigm shift, I read Fast like a Girl. It talked about breaking fasts with fermented foods/broth first. So I jumped on the bandwagon. The first few days I tried this method I realised I was overestimating my food needs by a lot and just doing volume eating as if a famine was coming.  I'd have some broth and then some lunch or dinner after an hour or two when hungry, rather than trying to pack in everything at once. I started becoming more in tune with when I was actually hungry. Normally I'd eat, feel way too full and then want to eat even more after twenty minutes. It was the opposite of all the advice I'd ever heard. 

I also quit sugar for Lent. My Mount Everest. A lifetime of sugar addiction. I mean hiding wrappers since I was a child. I had no ability to moderate. It was like my own slope was far more slippery than the average joe. I was on a bout of antibiotics back in December and my gut just never recovered so now was worse than ever. 

It took a full three weeks of cutting it out before my cravings finally died. I was still experiencing horrible food noise over two months in and going to Walmart to visit the cookie and candy aisle. Look but don't buy and consume. But I continued being strict.  

And then it stopped one day. Two full months in eating stopped feeling like an emergency. I could push an hour or two before eating. And I didn't feel like I had to eat chocolates just because they were available. I could if I wanted to and sometimes I'd eat one or two small pieces then feel an icky sweetness that made me not want more. 

I don't have to try all the new coffee shop seasonal gimmicks. I'm not going to be wasting money trying to get points. 

Found chocolates both in my car and my closet yesterday from when my mom was living here. I had no interest in eating it. I might later on but I also might not. 

My mom did Mounjaro for 7ish months and it take helped her but she has been very slim all her life so it only helped her lose 30lbs of menopausal weight and she hasn't gained it back. 

She kept trying to convince me to go on it as well. But I know for me it's a mental game and until I succeed in the mental game it would only ever be a temporary Band-Aid. 

Yesterday was my first day back home and I had a very empty fridge but I was too jetlagged to go shopping. So I started munching on tortilla chips. Then I thought, this isn't going to be very filling on its own so I got out a plate, opened a can of vegan chili and put it on the chips along with a small tin of guacamole and a tsp of cream cheese. I even got a second helping. And then I was satisfied and forgot food existed until 7 hours later when I felt a twinge of hunger and got a small order of sushi and didn't even finish it. Left it for the next day. Three months ago I couldn't fathom being this flexible and not planning out what I would be eating in 2-3 hrs.  

Lent is over and I'm not afraid of Oreos anymore. I'm still an overthinker, but I 'think' I've found lifestyle I can maintain.

I have some basic rules from this point forward
. 10k steps a day unless my sleep was crap

. Strength training at least 2x a week. 

. Not overstocking my fridge or pantry with food I ""have to eat"" otherwise it will go bad. I hate wasting food. 

.Having some basic staples and making things ahead of time I can freeze and prep for later. 

.Eating what I like in small portions but prioritizing fibre. 

. Water, espresso and tea and yerba for beverages. I recently became obsessed with yerba mate and bought too many flavors. It's almost replacing my coffee habit. 

. Daily tracking of goals in my fitness journal. ",2025-04-26 12:29:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k8btq1/i_think_this_is_what_longterm_success_and_freedom/

I did this through a calorie deficit and being conscious of my daily calories to this day. However, I don't know if I did this in the most healthy way, as I did this by volume eating low calorie foods to an extreme level. Like I'm so serious I feel that at this point I could be a competitive eater, I can eat two full Ninja blenders full of a smoothie, or 3 full family sized salad bowls of salad easily and this is what I do almost every day. I'm objectively a small person so I know this is not normal at all. I know that it's not healthy to have this stretched out of a stomach, but I don't know how to fix this because now when I try to eat normal portions and decrease my level of volume eating, I feel genuine hunger (or at least I think I do?).

If I intuitively eat less high-volume foods, I know that now I will need so much more of them due to me being used to the sheer volume that I eat on a daily basis! I know this because when I go out to eat, I can eat so much before hitting the point of fullness. Has anyone else experienced this? I just want to be normal but I just hate feeling hungry and I felt like for the last 3 years I found the cheat code but now I feel like I've taken this too far and I literally could be a competitive eater at this point.

1jvm864,loseit,How to lose more?,"Hi! I've went from 213 to 204. I'm obviously proud of that, but I would like to be losing more than a pound a week. I was hoping for any tips or tricks? I usually don't have breakfast (just not hungry in the mornings), a lunch that's 300 or less cals, and whatever I want for dinner. I try to be mindful of my portion for dinner. Occasionally, I'll have a ""treat"" like a 100 cal dessert, coffee, or protein smoothie. I rarely drink alcohol and mostly drink water except for when I have a fun drink as a treat. I've also been working out recently. I'm trying to go a bit slower so I don't get overwhelmed and give up which has been a huge help. I plan on working out an additional day, drinking more water (which I am terrible at), and cutting down on the occasional treat so they're more rare. I say I have a treat 3x a week and I'd prefer to do it 1-2x. Is there anything else I can do that could help? Right now, I'm losing 1 lb a week, but I'm hoping to lose 1 1/2-2 lbs a week. Also, any tips on how to drink more water? I don't mind the taste I just forget to drink it. Any advice is appreciated.

1jvephv,xxfitness,Training hard but lack of appetite,"So I listened to some of you guys on my last post. I have upped my strength training to at least 3 gym days and one light bodyweight only day. I ran 3 times last week to a total of 10 miles. And I did my self defense class once a week. I started a new running program to shave off 2 minutes from my 5k time this week where I run 4 times a week with 2 of those being easy runs.  My body is definitely changing and I like the results. However, I‚Äôm running into a different problem.

My appetite sucks.

Good news is that my blood sugar is more regulated. Used to, I would nearly pass out if I was late on a meal. I had to keep crackers on me. HOWEVER‚Ä¶. My appetite has become so small. It‚Äôs been this way for over 2 weeks. I honestly can‚Äôt be bothered to even make a smoothie for myself. My lunch just now was an apple and 2 cheese sticks. The thought of eating a whole sandwich is just unappealing to me and I am sometimes forgetting to eat. I haven‚Äôt been finishing my dinner some nights. 

Today is supposed to be an easy run day but my Garmin had me at a body battery of 38 this morning and I didn‚Äôt sleep well‚Ä¶. I definitely overtrained yesterday so I likely will just try to conserve my energy today and rest. 

Am I overtraining? What am I doing wrong here? I know I need to eat and I actually want to enjoy my food. 

-Update-

I took a couple of days off and my appetite improved. So thanks everyone who said I probably was training too hard. I likely will just stick to my running program 3-4 days out of the week and my martial arts class once a week. My body has given me other signals that I‚Äôve been pushing too hard‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have much longer until it‚Äôs going to be too hot outside to run anyway (even in the early mornings) so I‚Äôll just focus on running until June and shift to strength focus so I don‚Äôt burn out.

Old-school, barbells/dumbbells/kettlebells/cables with a few machines, a few bikes and treadmills, boxing ring. No smoothie bar, no pool, no Zumba classes (the only classes are strength and bodybuilding, but you're not required to take a class or private training). All are welcome, most people are friendly, I've only ever had one man offer me a spot and he sheepishly slunk away when I said ""No thanks.""

Things I'm finding that put me off: a gym has violent firearm/police imagery in the logos/all over the walls; another has memberships at $100/month or more; another upfront says they put every single member on a (very pricey) program, i.e. you can't just show up with your SBS notebook and work alone; another won't let you wear headphones - something about their ""culture""?

10omjtu,xxfitness,What Items Have Made Daily Fitness Easier for You?,"I've noticed certain things in my life have made leading a fit life easier/more attainable and was wondering what Items you all would say have helped you (short of massive pieces of home gym equipment).

Mine are:
- Good walking/running shoes. If my feet hurt, I walk a lot less. But with good shoes I find myself going longer and every little bit of regular daily activity counts in my book.

- Fitness tracker. Having something that actively reminds me to move if I've been sitting too long or ""tells"" me when I'm half assing a workout is incredibly helpful for me.

- MFP premium. Being able to customize my goals and see if I'm roughly getting the amount of nutrients that I need has been really nice because I can feel a difference since I started adding in what I was lacking. 

- A small fold-up stationary bike. Its not flashy by any means but in days when I would otherwise say F it, it's made sure that still get some form of exercise out of pure convenience. 

- Blender/Smoothies. I suck at getting in the amount of fruit and veggies that I should most day. Here enters smoothies. Do I want to eat several cups of fruits or veg? Nah. Do I want a large delicious cup of colorful slurpage? Absolutely, I do. I never knew what a difference having a decent blender would make in my quest to make heathier choices. 

- Easy(ish) access to a pool. Pool membership is one of my job perks. Reserving a time/lane when I'm available is much more difficult but it's indoors, heated, and 5 minutes from my house. I'm grateful to get to utilize it once a week for physical therapy/general exercise.

yddevy,xxfitness,"[Program Review] 16 suboptimal ""weeks"" (7 months) of GZCLP and still breaking PRs","**TL;DR**: **My old 1RMs are now my new 5RMs despite running GZCLP probably sub-optimally the entire time. Programming works, don't be scared or intimidated by it, especially if you want to get stronger.**

**Background**

5'3"", 135lbs, 27F, been lifting since 2016, never on a program or really tracked progress. Started beginner's 5/3/1 in February 2020 before COVID shut down everything. Mostly stuck to running/yoga/home workouts from 2020-21 waiting for my weight club to reopen. In February 2022, I tested my 1RMs and started with SL 5x5 to get me back in the gym, switching over to GZCLP in March 2022 once I felt run down. In addition to lifting 3-4x/wk, I tried to incorporate yoga and running 2x/wk or so. I also walk 5-7k steps/day normally, and once a week hit 15k+ steps when I'm out running errands.

**Goals**

The goals were simple: I wanted to lift more weight (get STRONK, if you will) and eat most of my protein. I'm lactose intolerant, have chronic acid reflux, and I work in a lab - so that second goal is harder than you'd think. Lots of protein-forward foods/snacks incorporate dairy or fatty/acidic foods, I can't eat big meals, and I can't have food at my desk so snacking is hard.

**The program**

GZCLP is a well-reviewed, popular program that has you doing full body workouts for each session at 4 sessions per cycle, ideally lifting 3 or 4 days a week with at least 1 rest day in between. The 4 compound lifts programmed are squat, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift. Each session pairs 1 compound lift for high weight/low rep (T1) with 1 compound lift for low weight/high rep (T2), and 3 accessory movements of your choosing (T3). For each cycle of 4 sessions, you're hitting each of the 4 compound lifts twice overall - once as T1, and once as T2.

I used /LegDaySkipper's spreadsheet, link in [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6pjiwd/heres_a_quick_summary_of_the_gzclp_linear/), where you can read more about the program. The sheet sets up one full block as 16 cycles, or roughly 16 weeks. For this first block, I picked accessories that I was familiar with or that I liked without paying too much attention to which sessions had what. I aimed to lift 3x/week, but...that didn't always work out.

**Nutrition**

Did not track macros or calories, but ate roughly at maintenance (1700-1900?). I've tracked calories before and it started to take a toll on my relationship with food, so I didn't do it. I just aimed to eat more protein. More protein shakes (MyProtein Clear Whey Isolate is the one), fruit/yogurt/soy milk smoothies, apples with cheese or peanut butter, tuna salad, tofu bowls, and chicken stir fries were all constants.

**16 suboptimal ""weeks"" of GZCLP?**

Well, what I thought would be 16 or so weeks turned into 7 months. Between work, other hobbies, and travel, it was tough to keep my 3 workouts a week going regularly. This would turn into 1-2x/wk instead. Not great, but never had any big lapses in program. The key for me was to keep going back. My protein intake also always needed work. On good days, I was only ever hitting 80-85g at my estimates, and usually I think I'm closer to 60-70.

**The numbers! (The good part)**

1RMs are from February before SL 5x5, and I tested my 5RMs as directed by GZCLP after finishing my 16th cycle last week. Also, a few months into GZCLP, I switched to a sumo stance for deadlifts since it was more comfortable for my anatomy. These are in pounds.

|Compound movement|1RM (before)|5RM (after)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Squat|130|130|
|Deadlift|150 (conventional)|150 (sumo)|
|OHP|40|47.5|
|Bench|75|70|

Weight didn't budge much, still stuck around 135lb. Surprisingly, my waist measurement did go down by 1.5-2in, and my face is more defined now. I try not to fixate on aesthetic goals because it fuels a worse relationship with my body, but this was interesting since there are mixed opinions on recomps.

**How I actually ran the program**

I started every workout with rolling, dynamic stretching, and physical therapy exercises for my shoulder (rotator cuff has had tendinitis in the past). I also did warmup sets for all of my compound lifts, particularly for the T1 lifts in preparation for the higher weight. I rolled and stretched as soon as I got back from the gym. So far I haven't had any major injuries and I hope it stays that way.

After 6 years of lifting so casually, my form still had a ways to go especially with heavier weight. My brother is a former powerlifter and suggested that I switch to sumo DLs. I do like sumo quite a bit since it allows me to sit back more than conventional and makes me feel STRONG. He also recommended that I switch to a narrower squat stance, which works better for my body. My squat depth is lower and more consistent now. Lastly I learned to brace properly, which in turn helped me to lift more.

I like the pyramid scheme (lol) for T1 lifts, as the weight I was lifting would continue to go up even as I switched from 5x3 to 6x2 to 10x1. I actually looked forward to 10x1, as I felt it was a real test of and/or testament to my strength. T2 lifts are...tough. My muscles were usually fine, but I would have to pause and catch my breath to brace properly to finish out the set. T3 accessory lifts are super customizable, and I'm already excited to switch things up going into a new block.

OHP was the hardest lift to progress. I hit failure on 10x1 multiple times on those suckers. I'm chalking (ha) that up to my past shoulder issues and how hard that movement is anyway. Hate OHPs but at least I'm not scared of them anymore. Percentage-wise, I'm proud of the progress I've made on them.

**My takeaways**

**Programming is used for a reason - it works. I don't know why I was so averse to starting a program, and I think I missed out on gains and efficiency through the years by not using one.** It's *nice* to go to the gym and know exactly what workouts you're gonna be doing. I'm also honestly just super blown away by how 3/4 of my old 1RMs are basically now my 5RMs. That's real proof that I got STRONGER. And that's ***despite not hitting all 3-4 workouts/wk and not eating enough protein.*** Until now, I thought that deadlifting 2 plates (225lbs) would just be a pipe dream. But I hit my last 10x1 round of sumo deadlifts at 180lb (!) so that goal of 225 feels like it's within reach now.

Eating is still a big issue for me - both frequency and finding ways to be more protein-heavy. I'm hoping that going into the winter, I can try out some new recipes (soups, stews, etc!) and feel less self conscious about how my body looks under all those layers.

I'm planning to do another 16 week block (64 workouts) of GZCLP, switching up the accessory lifts and swapping in bent over barbell rows in place of OHPs as a compound lift. My shoulders feel a bit beat up at the moment, although I'll keep doing dumbbell OHPs as a T3. Overall, I want to see how far this program can take me in strength while I continue to work on my nutrition goals this winter. I'd love advice for other programs to try though - another beginner program or is it time to graduate to something else?",2022-10-25 19:28:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/yddevy/program_review_16_suboptimal_weeks_7_months_of/
slcpol,xxfitness,Gain weight from 45 kg to 60 kg and do 15 full push ups after 3 months.,"Hello everyone! I am trying to gain weight this year (reach 60 kg from 45 kg) and get stronger (be able to do 15 full push ups at the end of 3 months). My other goals are have stronger grip strength, bigger arms, bigger butt, and at least a curvy physique.

For starters, I am 20 years old female I weigh 45 kg and I am 5'2 tall. 

For my diet, my daily calorie intake is around 1,367 (I used a tdee calculator this time because last time I just estimated it I manually calculated it and it was 1,485 but for this time I would use the result from the tdee calculator.) I decided to add 350 cals to it to do a calorie surplus which makes my set daily goal calories 1,717. For tracking the calories I would use MyFitnessPal App. I would also do smoothies and drink twice a day (before working out and before 1 or 2 hours before dinner). Is that recommended though?) then just eat 1 1/2 cups of rice each meal (I'm Asian so most of our meals are composed of one viand + rice and I just mostly eat 1 or less than 1 cup of rice.) and snacks in between, ideally I would want to eat 5 times a day with some small snacks/smoothies in between; breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, and dinner. Do you have any recommendations on what to eat or meal plan?

I did some research here on Google and Reddit and gained some insights as well from other redditors and u/Trackerbait suggested this subreddit to gain further advice for workout programs and gaining muscle. 

For my workout routine u/Trackerbait and u/thecelticwarrior94 suggested to look up the [bodyweight RR](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine)(which trains for 3 times a week with active rest days) and after reading through the post I decided to use it as a starting program for a beginner like me. I opted for bodyweight training since I don't really have access to a gym as of the moment since my mother doesn't want me to go outside frequently (COVID cases in my country is still high) and I don't have any real equipment at home aside from a resistance band. Although, I can make up some DIY equipment and did read some helpful posts here in reddit regarding DIY or homemade workout or lifting equipment. Do you have any other recommended workout programs  I should look up? 

Also, I just want to ask if my plan is somewhat decent like my diet, calorie surplus, and chosen workout program? Any advice, suggestion, or criticism are welcome. I would appreciate it.

qj1i5n,xxfitness,2 month beginner progress (Thinner Leaner Stronger),"ME: 29F, 5'3, starting weight was 164.2 lbs, current weight 149.4 lbs

# Backstory

I gained lots of weight (20+ lbs) during the lockdowns, fell in love, started a relationship, got unceremoniously dumped two months ago, realized I was locked into an incredibly expensive gym membership and started using it. I have had issues with eating disorders in the past and avoided taking progress photos or weighing myself for the last two months, so while I love looking at before/after pics, there will be none of those here. Sorry!

Strength training was something I'd always wanted to try but was intimidated by. My ex was big into lifting and kept promising to walk me through it to help boost my confidence, but unintentionally could be quite frustrating - told me to stick to machines until stronger, littered gym time with comments like ""honestly I thought you'd be stronger than this,"" huge emphasis on glute development, etc. So post-breakup I gritted my teeth and just watched a ton of YouTube videos and did my best.

# Routine

I started out on the 3 day TLS split, then worked up to the 4 day. I started adding yoga 2-4 days per week since it's offered by my gym, alternating between restorative and vinyasa. I thought I was hot shit after a year of YouTube yoga but it turns out I'm a total beginner!

Cardio is incidental for me. I tried doing 20-30 min of low impact cardio per week and I despise it. However, I'm very physically active for my job - my phone puts me at 20-30k steps per day - so I've decided that counts as good enough for me. I'm in the process of switching hopefully to a remote job, so if that happens I'll look more seriously into adding a consistent amount of cardio to my routine.

I'm just wrapping up the first stretch of the TLS program and moving into the deload week. I'd like to move up to the 5 day split but right now I'm hesitant about the time involvement.

# Diet

After my breakup, I immediately switched back to plant-based. I eat meat once or twice a week, but I'm looking to cut it out entirely for ethical reasons. This was something that I had compromised on during my relationship without realizing that was what I had been doing. I also have terrible IBS - dairy, wheat, and red meat trigger it. I don't measure (see: previous eating disorder) but I follow a consistent diet.

Breakfast - smoothie with soy milk, Vega Sport protein powder, chia seeds, apples, banana, spinach, silken tofu, pumpkin seeds, peanut powder, hemp seeds, beet powder

Lunch - Trader Joe's salad kits with vegan feta + lightlife tempeh bacon + pistachios + cranberries, also probably more dressing than is really needed. Their vegan feta is SO good, I try not to overdo it but I always want to. I'll add an avocado if I have one.

Snack - CLIF bar lol

Dinner - Pasta, tofu + rice bowl, or stir fry with rice and tofu

Snack - Fruit

My entire diet is really based on how I feel. At this point I have a good sense for how tired I should feel post-workout, and if it seems like it's taking too long to bounce back then I up the protein. I used to weigh and track food very closely and I can still eyeball it somewhat, so my sense is that I'm at around 1700-2000 calories per day, mostly depending on whether or not I remember to eat the CLIF bar. I eat out twice a week, either takeout or with friends, though tbh if I eat something that triggers my IBS I can say goodbye to seeing anything other than the inside of a bathroom for the next 24 hours.

Things I have noticed that are very important to me: no more knee pain! Pre-pandemic clothes are fitting properly again. Butt is no longer eating my underwear and I don't have to buy new clothes. Leggings now are all way too big on me. For about 15 minutes post-workout I have ab definition and it's very exciting.

I've noticed that I've conditioned myself to automatically relax and feel happier when at the gym, and am trying to take advantage of that mindset and use their coworking space to get some work done after my workout, which is having good career effects.

# Going forward

My friend is a powerlifter and has agreed to come to the gym with me for a day to help with form, since I am not confident about the deadlifts and am nervous to go up in weight or transition to a barbell properly with them and the squats. Right now I use the barbells with the set weights and do goblet squats with a 40 lb weight to try and work up to it. Sometimes I see guys in the weight area watching me (in a non-creepy way) and IDK if it's just that their eyes happen to be resting in my direction or if I'm doing something terribly wrong and they're wondering if they should step in. There are trainers roaming the floor and I see them watching me too and not once have they ever stepped in, so I'm probably good enough.

One note: I only do the first set of an exercise in front of a mirror, just to check for form. After that, I step away into a non-mirrored section. This is because I noticed I was starting to hyper-fixate on the way my body looked - if things jiggled, the texture of my skin, the rolls in my stomach, etc. It's really important to take control of your mindset and understand what triggers negative thought loops, and try to find ways to limit or cut it off.

My biggest takeaway from starting this is just general confidence! It's scary to start something new, it's scary to feel alone, but just pushing through it, starting small, and not being afraid to mess up in public have been hugely helpful. I see a lot of spillover effect in other areas of my life too. Not to mention so many people are into weightlifting and love to talk about their hobby once I mention it! Honestly in some ways it kind of feels like once I was free of a crap relationship, my body started dumping the excess weight. I like to joke that the first five pounds were probably water weight from crying so hard.

I'm pretty excited for Phase 2 of TLS. I despise the language of the ebook but it has been very helpful for understanding what to do and why he's structured the program the way he has.",2021-10-30 13:28:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/qj1i5n/2_month_beginner_progress_thinner_leaner_stronger/
ps9nty,xxfitness,Underfuelling? Overtraining? Halp,"Firstly, apologies if this doesn‚Äôt warrant a standalone post, there‚Äôs just a lot of detail for one of the daily threads.

I‚Äôm getting to the end of my tether with my current routine and I‚Äôm not sure what the answer is. I‚Äôve been a runner on and off for the last 10 years, but I got really consistent with it during the pandemic and eventually completed a solo HM last February. After that I started doing DownDog HIIT videos 5 mornings a
Week for more variety, and still running 2-3 times a week. In April I started strength training with Caroline Girvan videos - a couple of weeks of Epic beginner before starting Epic Heat with 4kg dumbbells. I kept up the running but it was more sporadic, although I kept up my weekly long Sunday run (up to 10k).

Once Heat finished I restarted it the following week, moving up to 6kg dumbbells (9kg for hip thrusts). I do a video every morning Monday - Friday. I skip the HIIT as I still do long runs on Sundays. I‚Äôm signed up for my first real HM in 7 weeks and I‚Äôm trying to train for that too, but I‚Äôm really struggling with energy and motivation. I do Epic around 6:20am and it‚Äôs done before I even know what‚Äôs happening. But I don‚Äôt have time to run until after work, at which time I‚Äôm exhausted (even though I have a desk job). I skip more midweek runs than not, although I usually keep up the Sunday long runs (I‚Äôm using a Hal Higdon plan). My area is pretty sketchy to run through so evenings are safer than early morning as there‚Äôs more traffic and footfall around. I also have gotten back into doing 15 mins of gentle yoga after the Epic video. Saturday is a complete rest day.

I am wrecked. By the weekend, I don‚Äôt want to make plans, all I can think about is getting prepared for the following week. I don‚Äôt have friends or hobbies because I haven‚Äôt the time or energy for either. I come home, cook for my partner and I, and we crash. Bed at 9:30pm but I‚Äôm lucky to sleep through the night. Then I‚Äôm up at 5:45am to do it all again. Like everyone, the last 18 months have been really stressful - I moved continents and am trying to juggle visas, work restrictions and settling in somewhere new. It‚Äôs fucking hard. My boyfriend is really supportive but there‚Äôs only so much he can do to help me.

In terms of nutrition, I am vegan but I aim for ~100g protein a day, including protein smoothies and bars. I am slightly anaemic but I take a supplement and I also take a multivitamin, magnesium and creatine. I was aiming for 1600 cals a day to try manage my weight but I‚Äôve stagnated around 127-129lbs  (5‚Äô1) after getting down to 120lbs earlier in the year before I started strength training. Tbh I always ended up overeating on the weekends, so I would average more than 1600 per day over the week. But most of my food is home cooked with lots of whole foods and veggies. Main vices are a shared bottle of
wine with my boyfriend and maybe a brunch/dinner out over the weekend. 

The main point of all this is that I‚Äôm tired, running out of motivation and my performance has stalled. I haven‚Äôt felt any real strength gains in a couple of months and areas like my triceps are almost as weak as day one. I feel like I‚Äôm spinning my wheels and am really hoping someone here can help me see the wood for the trees with it all. My goal has always been weight loss as I have more fat than I‚Äôd like, but I‚Äôve stalled so hard that mentally I need to step back from that for a while and try to just feel healthy and energetic again. 

Any advice/feedback on how to feel less tired, weak and rundown would be amazing. Thank you in advance.

nk3bwa,xxfitness,Bulking instead of slimming down,"Hi!

I'm a female in my 20s and I recently discovered and fell in love with F45 training. Signed up for a trial and  been going to 4-6 classes a week. Will definitely be getting a membership. During the workouts I sweat a lot and get super red. After, I feel great, stronger. I can see my muscles growing. But so is my scale. Pants are tighter on me than before. The classes are a lot of strength training and heavy weight lifting but also cardio. I know it's normal to see the scale go up as I'm building muscle but I'm feeling discouraged as I feel overall ""bigger"".

I don't follow any particular diet, I've just been doing a calorie defecit. However, I do take BCAAs before and after my workout and try to eat a high protein low calorie smoothie after my workouts. Is that the problem? Should I not be supplementing right after the workout and let my body stay in the 'burn zone' without any food? I do want my muscles to recover but not necessarily see them grow.

Should I be doing different exercises? More reps less weights or more cardio? Pleaee help!

TLDR: F, 20s started doing F45 strength training (has cardio in it). Take BCAAs before and after workout, sometimes low kcal high protein smoothie after workout too. On a calorie defecit, don't follow any particular diet. Bulking instead of losing weight. Please help. Should I not eat after workouts or change the exercises I do?",2021-05-24 17:27:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/nk3bwa/bulking_instead_of_slimming_down/
m2wffg,xxfitness,I went to the gym when I didn't feel like it,"For context, my sleep has been particularly trash this week (I'm talking,  staying up until 3am for no reason, despite waking up at 7am). In general, my sleep is trash, but this week was a little more hard. Last night I got ""more"" sleep, but was still very tired. It helps that one of my roomies works at the Y (the gym I now go to), so I have to drive there anyways. But after I dropped her off,  I was sitting in my car contemplating if I should go inside. It was a 70/30 split of ""go home""/""stay"" for me, but I tried to trick myself to work out. I told myself ""ok I'll bring my workout bag in my trunk and I can decide once I drive there"", ""hey, let me drink this smoothie at the very least, and I'll decide from there"", ""alright, let me play music from my workout playlist and maybe I'll think about going in to the gym"". At that point, I basically was ready to go into the gym. And decided to go in. 

Personally this is huge; I struggle with consistency, and my (reasonable) tiredness was gonna stop that consistency I'm trying to build up. Plus the alternative - driving home and taking a nap before work - would lead me to have a bunch more sleep paralysis episodes, and those drain the life out of me. Plus, once I started actually working out, it was enjoyable and I was more awake than when I left. 

So this is all to say, I'm hoping that I would do the thing that I should do vs want to do. And oftentimes, what I should do can actually be something I like to do!",2021-03-11 17:59:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/m2wffg/i_went_to_the_gym_when_i_didnt_feel_like_it/

Tl;dr anybody strength train/lift weights on a fasted stomach? Or naw?

///

I tried searching in here, but I don't think i found what I was looking for. Ok so I recently got a gym membership and I am pumped to do barbell work again. I loved lifting and sad I couldn't do it when shut down first started (I was only lifting for a few months up until Jan 2020). I'm also coming out of a funk, and I want to take advantage of this second (third? fourth?) wind that I have. 

I met up with my trainer friend yesterday to go over the big lifts so that I knew my form would be good as I start lifting again. During our session, I passed out in the middle of it,  which we both suspect it was because I didn't fuel up beforehand (I have been drinking this green smoothie thats huge, about 32oz, as my breakfast every day, and I was in a rush to get there and only had ~25-50% of that normal amount). Once he gave me a sugary drink and gummy worms, I was good for the 2nd half of the session.

As another note, I've been doing 14:10 IF and that has been something that has been consistent and I want to maintain. It helps me to have some sort of control in one area of my health and fitness (and my life tbh).

Which got me thinking. My schedule right now it makes sense to work out between 7-9am on weekdays (before work). But if I have my big smoothie before I go in, that would mean that my fast would stop for the day around 5pm. Which makes it hard if I ever want to eat out with or cook a meal with friends, as most people are done with work after 5pm. And I do enjoy eating meals with people; I recognize for my own mental well-being I need that quality time with people. 

I know I have a tendency to think too far into the future for unnecessary ""what ifs"", but I was wondering for people lifting weight and doing IF, do you work out on a fasted stomach? Or do you usually work out after having something to eat an hr beforehand? I want to walk a balance of sticking to goals that I have, but also not feeling trapped in how I eat or overthinking this part of my health and fitness.",2021-03-01 04:16:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/luzq5q/intermittent_fasting_and_strength_training_in_the/
kjhu0p,xxfitness,Reverse Diet or Body Recomposition?,"Update: I‚Äôve slowly increased my calories to 1,900-2,000kcal over the past few months! I believe this to be my maintenance, but want to increase it to 2,500 or even 2,700kcal. 

Background: I‚Äôve been on and off with ‚Äúdieting‚Äù  and working out for 3 years (since July ‚Äò17). Over these three years I‚Äôve learned to exercise in a manner that I like (why long distance run for the caloric burn if my knees hurt?) and eat in a way that makes me happy (green smoothies may be healthy, but I prefer to eat my greens). Although I‚Äôve learned this, I was really restrictive with my calories earlier this year (eating max 1,400kcal, cutting out carbs, doing extended fasts, and exercising for 2-3 hours everyday). I was undereating and overtraining. I most likely influenced my hormonal system for the worst (had some delayed periods during this process). Through some amazing YouTube videos and some introspection, I learned that what I was doing to my body was unhealthy and disrespectful. 

I stopped restricting my calories around mid September and have been eating a healthy amount with restricting any major food groups. I‚Äôve also taken up therapy and am slowly learning to love myself a little bit more. This has definitely helped me with my relationship with the scale. I can now step on it and not judge my self worth by it. I even play a game in which I estimate how much ‚Äúfat I‚Äôve gained‚Äù based on my carb, water, and sodium intake the previous day. Overall, I believe that I‚Äôve developed a good relationship with exercise and food over these years. I look forward to eating without any restriction and exercising when my body feels like it.

Stats:
- 19F
- 68.4kg (average for this week)
- Height: 163cm, 5‚Äô4‚Äù
- Estimated BFP: 29.3% using the U.S. Navy Method (I‚Äôm in the late luteal phase, so I expect this number to be slightly lower than estimated) 
- Activity level: slightly/moderately active; I weight train 4x a week, have 1 cardio session, and walk around 10,000-15,000 steps a day.

Goals: 
- Build muscle and subsequently increase my metabolism; I‚Äôm estimating my TDEE to be around 1,900-2,000kcal (I‚Äôm currently tracking my calories and weight to accurately determine the number) and would to have it at 2,500-2,600kcal. 
- Lose some fat (not by the scale) - by decreasing my BFP. I‚Äôd ideally like to be at 20-22% BFP (the ‚Äúfitness‚Äù range)

My primarily goals are to build some muscle, lose the small layer of fat that lays on top of this muscle, and increase my overall health and happiness. 

I‚Äôm at a point in which muscle definition is apparent if I ‚Äúflex‚Äù, but I‚Äôd like to decrease my body fat percentage, so this definition is more apparent. Calories wise, I never want to eat anywhere close to 1,400kcal. Going below 1,700kcal is really hard and brings about a restrictive mindset, so I don‚Äôt want to undergo a process in which I have to cut my calories below my comfort level just for the sake of building muscle and losing fat. 

I know the pros and cons of both processes. I would like to avoid the cycle of cut and bulk that a lot of people fall into. I‚Äôd like to undergo one of these process, build muscle and lose some fat, and then maintain from there. I don‚Äôt mind how long the process takes. I‚Äôd rather spend a year building 10-12 pounds of sustainable muscle than cut and bulk (which can lead to a very restrictive mindset). I have e a solid program and a healthy diet. 
I like the idea of being able to increase my metabolism with a reverse diet, but I fear the gaining excess fat. If I was to reverse diet, I would do so at a small rate (not a crazy 300 kcal surplus). If I was to recomp, I‚Äôm afraid my body would just cling on to any excess caries and direct it towards fat storage, not muscle building. I know my fears are irrational. 

TLDR; Which process (reverse diet or body decomposition) is best for my goal of building muscle, increasing my metabolism, and decreasing BFP?",2020-12-24 16:07:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/kjhu0p/reverse_diet_or_body_recomposition/

Breakfast- Coffee + buttered multigrain-sourdough toast crusts I cut off of my daughter's toast.  

Lunch:  Smoothie with about 60g protein.

Dinner: Whatever I feel like.

As you can see, my lunch smoothie is a critical part of my plan.  It gets me most of my protein for the day, and allows me to eat a normal dinner to my liking without trying to cram more protein in.  

But the weather is quite cold now where I live, and I'm struggling with my protein shake.  The ""hot"" shake recipes I've tried, are just not delicious.

- Can water weight be added on incrementally? 
- How long Can water weight stay on if you do nothing about it? 
- aside from proper hydration, what else will induce water weight loss?
- Can lifting cause water weight gain? 


I‚Äôd like to know the answers to these questions because I‚Äôm unsure why I gained  5lbs this month and if it has to do with water weight. 

After a lot of  effort, leaned out to 120lbs end of September.I didn‚Äôt really try to maintain it, so I went back to 123lbs for two weeks (no binging or massive increase in calories). 

Then this past two weeks, I‚Äôve been consistently weighing in at 125lbs. Even though prior I‚Äôve been easily able to maintain 123lbs since July.

Notes:
- this is the first month I‚Äôm seriously dedicated to lifting. 4-5x a week
- I‚Äôve almost completely cut out cardio. And am now EXTREMELY sedentary around the house.
- my stomach has leaned out but my arms feel/look softer/bigger more than usual 
- Diet wise........I honestly feel like I‚Äôve maintained my general portion sizes and eat 90% healthy. I‚Äôve logged my food sporadically from the beginning of the month 
- Diet. Now that I think about it, I‚Äôve started incorporating a protein smoothie. Maybe the protein smoothie has more calories than I think?

fiuzuv,xxfitness,Program Review - Successful run of Russian Squat Routine + Crossfit + Calorie Deficit,"**GOAL:**

**Cut and increase strength. Get stronger without giving up HIIT.**

**RESULT**

2 months/7 weeks ish:

\+27g/60lbs to low bar squat

\-4.5kg/10lbs body weight

**STATS**

||Age|Weight|Squat|

|Beginning|31|187lbs/84.5kg|295lbs/135kg|
|Final|31|177lbs/80kg|355lbs/161kg|

**HISTORY**

Before I started real fitness, I did some Tae Kwon Do as a teen and some fencing. Then I dated someone who loved walking and hiking everywhere. So that‚Äôs what I did for some time. Then I backpacked around Australia, and eventually worked on a cattle station for a stint. I then returned to Canada, then I decided to buy a bike and rode it everywhere. I eventually moved in with this bro who did crossfit, he said I should try. I gave it a go. I thought ‚Äúholy shit I‚Äôm really not fit.‚Äù And reliably started going multiple times a week for two years, then decided ‚Äúthis barbell shit is lit‚Äù and entered a powerlifting meet. After that first meet.... I knew I wanted to see how strong I can get.

*TL;DR: Did things, took me a while to decide powerlifting is fun*

I ran smolov jr, got some great high bar strength gains. Ran smolov and did too much on top of that, didn't listen to my body, got injured and burnt out. (The barbell got caught on my hair and pulled me down with it during a bail and I twisted my ankle)

I ran some other strength work, but I spent the entirety of last summer doing high intensity cycling + long distance cardio for a fondo event. (a 122km/76mile bike ride up a mountain). My diet was uncoordinated and I lost everything I gained from Smolov. Coming back, a 2 plate squat was rough. After the fondo, I had a month before a provincials powerlifting meet, got back a lot of strength, and qualified for regionals in Canada. I actually came here for advice. I just didn‚Äôt want to give up crossfit and cardio.

I asked the r/weightroom sub for a program suggestion. Russian Squat Routine was suggested. My crossfit coach confirmed not only is it a great program, but you can run it alongside cf. Cool. I was in. I switched from high to low bar, did a few weeks of practice of Low Bar, tested a 1RM, hit 295lbs.

Oh, I also started a cut at this time.

I was successful, but it took a lot of work that I think most people would not have the time for.

**PRIOR TO RSR CYCLE**

* Squat: 1x135kg (295lbs) (I used 315, as I had hit it before for a high bar)

Weight was 85kg (187lbs)

**THE PROGRAM**

It‚Äôs a 3x per week 6 week squat program.

**PART 1**

Every other day for the first 3 weeks is your 80% for 6x2. The other days are 6 sets of increasing reps until you finish the first part of the cycle at 6x6 @ 80%.

**PART 2**

After that, every other day is the 6x2@80%, the other days are one less set and rep off the 6x6 but adding 5% (15lbs for me). 5x5  80% +15lbs, 4x4  80%+30lbs etc etc until you hit your max for a double (2x2)

So‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt exactly want to give up crossfit either. So I continued with it up until the testing week.

**EXECUTION**

On Mondays, Weds, and Fridays, I‚Äôd hit a morning session to focus on strength. I‚Äôd do RSR first, and then supplement with back and leg accessories, and then follow that with bench + arm accessories. I‚Äôd have an alternating week 1 bodyweight/DB focus (pull ups, push ups, dumbbell rows and presses) and a week 2 barbell accessory focus (barbell deadlifts, rows, lunges). This was just to get some traction in self programming. It wasn‚Äôt the focus, and was done only for self learning and I don‚Äôt mind most accessories.

I‚Äôd go to crossfit on those days, as well as on Sundays, Sat, and Tues. I‚Äôd rest on Thursdays. The total volume varied a little per week, but it was mostly 15-16ish hours of work per week. Women can typically handle a lot of volume, and since I was on a cut and leaning down, my gymnastics improved‚Ä¶.however

Due to the volume, after the 5x5 I actually did an impromptu deload week. In the deload week I aimed for same intensity, just greatly reduced volume. Right up to my 90% for doubles. I worked on handstand walks. It was a fun way to be at the gym and work on something without being taxing. [They really started to come along!](https://i.imgur.com/7ySycYT.mp4)

[I also did this silliness. Because why not?](https://i.imgur.com/dhAASNf.mp4)

After the deload, in returning to the program, I reduced the volume for the last three weeks and repeated the 5x5. CF classes were reduced to about 3x per week until the week of testing, where I stopped cf a week before I tested. I did the 2x2 on Monday, 6x2 on Weds, went for a swim on Thurs, and tested the following Sat.

On the suggestion of a friend, [I tried these for the first time](https://i.imgur.com/gZiCzzK.mp4), I don't know how to describe them (Quarter Squat recoveries?) but they were a fantastic way to introduce the feeling of heavier weight, and gain some confidence with the stimulus. I had attended a seminar held by Chad Wesley Smith who had given the suggestion of walkouts for the same ""feel what heavy weight is before your see it on the platform/test"" stimulus.

The 6x2s were tough some days, and some days they were such ego boosters. The 5x5 was probably the roughest day. If you're doing this program, yes, some days the 6x2 is hard, but that's what it's for. A recovery day without 0 stimulus. Your body is recovering, even if it feels weak in moving that weight. Don't worry.

Two weeks towards the end of the program I started Mag/Ort deadlift program to time it with a meet, they seem compatible.

**DIET**

Welp. So, here‚Äôs where it got intense. And it's here that made the situation work. This is the hardest part.

* I used RP‚Äôs 1 on 1 (Renaissance Periodization diet and nutrition coaching). Not only are macro goals given, the exact carbs, fats, and protein are delegated per meal depending on the time and training day. Bulk of carbs in the morning during double training days to replenish glycogen for the evening training (crossfit). I followed it almost 100% to a T.
* Not only are macros given, times given, and macro proportions per meal per training day given, but the food choices are also given. Just because I could make a cookie fit the macros, doesn‚Äôt mean it was the best thing I could do. So I didn‚Äôt deviate.
* I don‚Äôt eat meat or have dairy, so it was egg whites, nutritional yeast, tofu, pecans, broccoli, kale, other green veggies, and protein powder. I miss fries, beer, and real chocolate.
* I broke once or twice. It was always within the ‚Äògood food‚Äô given, but on testing week, where I wasn‚Äôt training, it got really hard. Very few carbs, and I broke one day and had, like, two extra smoothies. Going to the gym was easy, this diet was hard.

**RECOVERY**

Really tried to get my sleep, as I was putting the effort into diet and training. Some days were good, occasionally I cracked and got a 4hr sleep night, but most times I was able to get 6-7hrs in.

Epsom salt baths on sore days.

I changed some of the CF workouts - the coaches understood, in order to prevent too much strength overlap that would kill recovery.

**STATS AT THE END**

* Squat: 2x150kg (330lbs)
* Beltless 1x142kg (315lbs) [Pretty happy with the smoothness](https://i.imgur.com/PnlF4JX.mp4)
* 1RM BS 1x161kg/355lbs + 2x bodyweight squat (I'm not a small lady haha)

**WEIGHT**

* End of cycle 1: 80kg (177lbs)
* Down two notches on my lever belt. (This was a big surprise)

**PICS**

[My 355lbs squat complete with me being a happy moron at the end.](https://i.imgur.com/YX5HlHO.mp4)

**CONCLUSIONS AND WHAT NEXT**

* Started running Mag/Ort, I did week 3 after the 1rm test and will start nuckols bench program 3x per week intermediate.
* It‚Äôs possible to complete a cycle on a calorific deficit. Monitor your recovery.
* Seek advice of others who know more than you.
* All the accessory dumbbell work really didn‚Äôt help my bench, but [my arms definitely gained mass :D.](https://i.imgur.com/ssNOHb4.jpg) And to be honest, my legs did as well.
* I really like egg whites and nutritional yeast, thank god, or this would have been impossible.
* I respond well to volume, but I need more experience on programming.
* To qualify for nationals, my goal is a 160 squat (achieved), 190 deadlift (15kg off), and a 70kg bench (5kg off - I've only ever hit 70kg with a TnG). If I can do that with a 164lbs bodywieght (eventual goal) I‚Äôd hit a 400 Wilks. Which would be super cool.
* My diet up until this point had nowhere near enough protein. Holy. Track that. I was eating 8 meals, each with 20g protein on double training days.
* To reiterate, I truly think my diet diligence was the key to success.
* I go to two gyms, and both are wonderful and full of friends who supported me and have similar goals, which I found VERY helpful. Considering my life was gym - work - gym - meal prep - sleep - repeat
* I am not going to lie, and I'm being 100% transparent, *I have always been pretty strong.* In elementary school, I was a strong girl. Genetically, I truly believe some people gain muscle mass easier than others, and once I got my protein in, my arms, legs, and strength really responded effectively. Your mileage may vary.
* A slow moving scale is frustrating, but managed expectations are important.

This was very long, it is my first review.

fbm846,xxfitness,Progress: 9 years of fitness becoming a lifestyle (currently without any weightlifting),"I hope it's okay that I'm posting this with a throwaway. I didn't want these photos permanently connected to my main account, as lots of real-life friends know my username.

**History and goals:** So this might not be the most standard progress post, as I've been working towards improving myself for 9 years. It hasn't been a straight path at all. My main goal was to always look *and* feel good. On the aesthetic side, I didn't want to have to worry about clothes not fitting well, which is probably the more shallow goal. But I also just wanted to generally feel athletic. I was very chunky throughout all of high school, and I was never athletic whatsoever. I was probably at my heaviest during my sophomore year of high school, and I lost some weight without really trying to before college.

I got to college and partied hard and definitely gained a lot of weight. The photo in my before/after is from my freshman year of college. I was drinking a lot and working out almost never. I never felt comfortable in my own body at that weight. Midway through my sophomore year of college, I started Couch to 5K and Insanity, and I completed both and lost a good amount of weight and felt pretty healthy again.

In my junior and senior year of college, I got into lifting, and this was extremely bad for me. I probably looked the best I ever looked, which is why I'm not posting pictures of that time, because any comments in support of how I looked then have the potential to be triggering. I was eating an appropriate amount of calories, but my tracking habits were disordered. I refused to eat at any restaurant that didn't have nutritional information on the menu. If I went over my calorie count, I went into a panic. Weightlifting and calorie counting both had SO many numbers involved that I was spending my days just obsessing over numbers. But even beyond the mental issues, I also still didn't feel healthy in my body. I felt strong, sure. But I didn't feel like I was all-around athletic. My mobility and flexibility were awful. My cardio fitness was absolutely terrible, because I subscribed to the belief that cardio wasn't important.

I realized that this was no way to live, and I took a step back. I stopped weightlifting around 2014, and I haven't gone back. In 2015, I took up yoga, and I fell in love with it. I also had ClassPass, so I supplemented my yoga classes with things like Pilates and barre, with occasional classes to support my cardio health.

From the winter of 2017 till the spring of 2018, I started partying too hard again, but this time, it caused me to lose a ton of weight. Once I realized that my lifestyle wasn't very healthy, I made a big switch. I definitely still drink (I'm writing this one DIPA in!), but it's not the biggest part of my life. From 2018 through most of 2019, I went to one or two yoga classes per day. Of course, I missed some days, and other days, I still supplemented with things like barre or HIIT. I also got really, really into hiking, like 13-26 mile hikes on a frequent basis. My lifestyle also has me walking about 6-8 miles every day.

In late 2019, I started boxing and kickboxing and fell in love! I wish I had progress photos pre-boxing, because honestly, it hasn't changed my body too much in terms of appearance, and I attribute most of my arm muscles to yoga, although boxing certainly helps. However, consistent boxing has totally changed the way I feel in my body. I find cardio super important now. My boxing classes include a treadmill component, and when I started, I sprinted at 8 MPH. Now, I sprint at 12 MPH on level 2 incline. Seeing this progress has been great, because I can really feel it within. Boxing has also done wonders for my core strength - the actual punches are a lot of obliques, and the classes always include ab segments. 

**Before and after:** I'm about 5'4"" or 5'5"" in both photos. I don't know how much I weigh in the before picture. I'm about 130lb now. Again, the first photo is from my freshman year of college in 2011. The other ones are from today. The first two photos from today are flexed, as if that's not obvious, haha. The last one is unflexed. [PHOTOS HERE - NSFW](https://imgur.com/a/uJy0ghz)

Also, I know these photos have a lot of differences - harsh beach lighting vs. early morning apartment lighting, posed vs. unposed, taken in the middle of the day on vacation vs. taken first thing in the morning, etc. I hope it still shows that I have made some progress (trust me, even flexing in the best lighting in 2011 wouldn't have revealed any arm muscle!), although a lot of the progress I'm talking about in this post is mental.

**Diet:** I eat about 2500 calories per day on average. I'm more of a snacker, but I use the Freshly meal service for some good protein & veggies (I don't know how to cook, and I'm not particularly interested in learning!). My typical day would be a protein bar in the morning as soon as I wake up (250-300 calories), an acai bowl or a smoothie for breakfast (500 calories), a Freshly meal for either lunch or dinner (500 calories), and then a variety of other snacks throughout the day (1000+ calories).

I do not limit myself at all with things having to be ""clean,"" because that brings up disordered habits for me. If I want to eat Taco Bell for dinner, I do. If I'm more in the mood for fruit, I eat fruit. If I want candy, I eat candy. If a friend invites me out to a restaurant without calorie counts, no problem. All that being said, I do tend to eat mostly healthy food. Also, while I do track my food on MyFitnessPal, if I eat 2500 calories and still feel hungry, I'll eat something else. This is the best I've ever felt about my eating habits. It's not a source of stress for me anymore, which feels like a big accomplishment after having it kind of take over my life for years.

I don't eat red meat, but that decision has nothing to do with fitness, so I'm not sure if that's necessary to include, but just in case anyone was wondering!

**Routine:** I don't follow a set routine, so I hope this part is okay in terms of detail. Most days, I ambitiously schedule a yoga class and a boxing/kickboxing class. I definitely don't always find the time in my life to make it to both, but I almost always make it to at least one (unless I'm on vacation or something). Some days, I double up on yoga, and that's always a treat. Rarely, I'll double up on boxing. I sometimes continue to supplement with Pilates or barre or any other fun group classes that catch my eye.

If you wanted to follow my routine, it might look like yoga on Monday, yoga & boxing on Tuesday, boxing on Wednesday, yoga on Thursday, yoga & boxing on Friday, yoga & boxing on Saturday, and yoga on Sunday. The yoga classes are all fast-paced vinyasa; my Fitbit says I burn about 250 calories in an hour, which I take to be a slight overestimate. For boxing, it typically says 400 calories in a 50 minute class.

My commute involves a great deal of walking, so I tend to walk about 8 miles per day (which also includes any running that I do on the treadmill during a boxing class, but I also try to reach 8 miles even when I don't go to that class).

ETA: I'm also a yoga instructor as my second job (my main job is a desk job). I didn't think to include that at first, because I spend most classes wandering around the room correcting form and do not burn a significant amount of calories or count that as a workout. But it does mean that I have a little bit of extra activity beyond what I listed above.

**Measurable progress or achievements:** Yoga is fun because you can make progress without it involving any numbers, and progress based on numbers, whether in terms of lifting or my weight, was never healthy for me. I can do most arm balances (one-legged crow was a recent one that was exciting to me, as was the transition from eight angle pose to crow to chaturanga), and my headstand is pretty solid. It's hard to describe my progress in boxing in words, but I feel more confident in my form now? And I already mentioned the treadmill progress. 

Aesthetically, I'm happy with how my body looks, and happiness is all I care about here. I don't have the proportions that I usually see valued on this sub. I don't care too much about my glutes growing or my waist shrinking. I get a lot of comments on my arm muscles, which have come primarily from yoga (again, boxing definitely helps, but I only started in late 2019 & there hasn't been a huge change in the past couple months). My legs are not super muscular, but they can take me on 26 mile hikes, so I'm happy with them.

But more than anything, I just feel generally healthy and athletic, which is a wonderful way to feel. When I was just lifting, it felt like a bad day or a bad week would destroy my progress. Now, I feel like I can just live normally and know that I'm happy with my body and my abilities, even if I eat a whole plate of enchiladas followed by churros or skip workouts for a week on vacation. I might not *look* as great, but I could still step onto my mat and flow through 60 minutes of yoga or get in front of a bag and punch it hard. Stepping away from lifting and finding something that allows me to be the healthiest version of myself is definitely my top achievement.

**Going forward:** I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing, unless I get bored of it, and then I'll find something else that interests me! I'm definitely never going back to anything that's so heavily focused on numbers as lifting was. 

I'll be upfront about it that I still get caught up occasionally with numbers where I can (trying to get 6-8 miles a day or trying to workout 30 days in a row, or whatever it is). However, it's something that I'm aware of and constantly try to work through. I recently went on a vacation where I lived on a small boat without a gym, and I literally couldn't walk that many miles unless I was the weirdo pacing around the boat, and it was a very helpful experience. I hope to continue having experiences like that.",2020-03-01 00:53:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/fbm846/progress_9_years_of_fitness_becoming_a_lifestyle/
f61up4,xxfitness,Progress Report: 1 year 60lb weight loss,"It was recommended that I write a progress report for my yearlong weight loss, so here goes.
On February 16, 2019, I decided I was tired of feeling like crap all the time. I realized that I physically felt terrible after eating fast food and super processed food. I was grabbing convenience foods a lot. I work a sedentary office job and am a gamer. I would park on my couch on raid nights with a bottle of wine and a bag of gummies, peanut m&ms, or chips and mindlessly snack while I played (and died lol). One of the main reasons I wanted to lose weight, aside from health, was so that I could ride the Icelandic horse on my trip to Iceland in July (there was a weight limit and I was right at it). Spoiler alert, I did go for a glorious 3 hour ride through the countryside and was sore for 48 hours after. Worth it.


**Before and After:**
Height: 5‚Äô3‚Äù
Age at start: 38, age at finish: weeks shy of my 40th
Before weight: 239
After weight: 179
Weight loss is from February 16 2019 ‚Äì February 16 2020, so one full year.
Progress pics! (NSFW) https://imgur.com/a/pEuW9Pg 


**Diet**
I cut out most dairy. I suspected that I was lactose intolerant anyway, so it wasn‚Äôt a huge sacrifice to end the gastrointestinal torment. I was still eating skyr (Icelandic yogurt) which didn‚Äôt seem to bother me as much. I have since cut almost all dairy except trace amounts out of my diet. I cut way back on meat, and embraced alternative protein sources. I love tofu. I had learned to like beans during a previous stint with food insecurity, so those came more heavily into my rotation. I experimented with lentils, tempeh, and seitan. I focused on eating whole foods and a lot more fruits and vegetables. Smoothies became a regular feature of my diet because I could cram spinach and all the healthy sticks and seeds in there and have something nutritionally dense that was still tasty. I did do Veganuary but I have since gone back to a more flexitarian diet while I work through what‚Äôs in my freezer. I did track calories using Cronometer because I wanted to make sure my micronutrients were being met, but didn‚Äôt really focus on macronutrients, except protein later on. I supplemented B vitamins (I took a complex with B12) and D because I live in Maine and winter is never ending. 

While I tracked everything and tried to keep myself around 1300 calories in the beginning (which is hard, and I had to rethink my calories) I didn‚Äôt deny myself if I wanted something, and didn‚Äôt assign moral value to food (‚Äúgood‚Äù food vs ‚Äúbad‚Äù food). I didn‚Äôt freak out if I went over my calories, understanding that one day wouldn‚Äôt ruin my progress. I gently corrected people that use the word ‚Äúdieting.‚Äù Right now I‚Äôm eating around 1500-1600 calories which is working out for me.

Common foods I ate were overnight oats (1/2 cup oats, I TBSP each chia, milled flax, and hemp seeds, 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk was my base recipe), a banana every day, a lot of tofu stir fries, and a lot of soup. I love soup, and it‚Äôs easy to meal prep.
I also increased my water intake, limiting Pepsi to days I had a migraine and needed to chase my meds with caffeine.



**Routine**
This is probably going to be the least helpful part for anyone. I started out with walking. I have a few routes through my small town I can take, and I largely based my routes on where pokestops were in Pokemon Go (which incentivized me to get out of the house). My walks were about 2 miles to start, and my feet hurt because I had crappy cheap sneakers. Then my local hospital‚Äôs prevention department‚Äôs Spring catalogue came out and I saw they were hosting a Couch to 5k class, which, since I no longer worked for them I had to pay to join, but enrollment came as I got my taxes and it was only $30 anyway, with a former coworker that I liked and trusted. It was hard, my shins hurt a lot, and there were times that I thought I‚Äôd never be able to do a complete set of intervals. I did all of my day 3‚Äôs (class only met twice a week) on a soft, forested trail which made running so much easier. I got stronger, and got better, and realized I loved running. It was great stress relief too since I had an employee getting ready to retire and her give-a-fuck was completely gone and was a negative cloud around the whole office, so leaving early twice a week to run was great. I wasn‚Äôt able to run for 5k at the end of it, I still needed intervals, but I felt confident I could keep running.

I also started hiking this summer, and managed to hike 3 mountains in my state (my highest being a 1700 footer) and a volcanic crater in Iceland (10/10 want to do again). 

In September I joined Planet Fitness, and met with a coach in October to develop a plan. I didn‚Äôt stick with it. I am very shy and so I focused more on walking on the treadmill and running, but eventually I started to go near the machines, looking up how to use them on Youtube well in advance so I wouldn‚Äôt look dumb. I don‚Äôt have set days I do resistance training, and some days I‚Äôm lazy and just walk on the treadmill. On bad weather days (like tonight) I don‚Äôt go at all. For what it‚Äôs worth, my strength training includes:

	Bicep curls 15lbs 2x20 (sometimes I do 3x15)
	Triceps presses 40lbs 2x20 
	Shoulder presses, my arch nemesis 10lbs 4x10
	Row 30lbs 2x20
	Fly 30lbs 4x10 (or 3x15 depending on how strong I feel)
	Hip Abductors 100lbs 3x20
	Hip Adductors 100lbs 3x20
	Seated leg press 50lbs 3x20

I generally prefer to just do arms and legs all on one day and then walk or run the next day. I need to really sit and think out a better plan to balance what I enjoy (running) with what‚Äôs not as fun (strength‚Äîmainly upper arms). I also need to stop being lazy and do core. I generally spend about an hour at the gym, and try to go 3 or 4 days a week, but like I mentioned, weather keeps me away, and depression kept me out for a full week a couple months ago.


**Measurable Progress**
I can run a 5k now (on the treadmill). I‚Äôm really slow so it takes about 45 minutes or so to get there. When I was driving behind my niece at Christmas and she hit a deer/a deer ran into the side of her car, I was able to run the quarter mile to her car from mine to check on her/pick up her side mirror from the road without being out of breath. I‚Äôve lost 60 pounds, with another 20 to go to my goal (and I will probably reach for another 20 after that). I haven‚Äôt done any measurements but my upper arms have gotten smaller and when I flex, I can see a li‚Äôl baby muscle in there that wants to be bigger.


**What I‚Äôve Learned**
The day before and the first day of my period I am invincible. I feel like I can run forever. I‚Äôve become more confident in the gym. I‚Äôve learned a lot of about food, and eating to fuel my body. I‚Äôve also learned that losing weight is expensive and I don‚Äôt want to go try on pants to replace the ones that are falling off me, lol
I still have days where body dysmorphia is a real bitch and I feel like the fattest thing ever. I hate my upper thighs and how nothing seems to be coming off them, but on the flip side, I‚Äôm happy that I have my waist back. I have a great support system that reminds me of how well I‚Äôve done when I start negative self talk.
Thanks to this sub for all the resources, it‚Äôs been monumentally helpful, even just reading threads. Y‚Äôall are fabulous. <3",2020-02-19 00:22:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/f61up4/progress_report_1_year_60lb_weight_loss/
f03fti,xxfitness,"Muscles near knees quick to tighten, excruciating soreness for 2-3 days","I'm 5'2"", \~110lbs and my current routine is a 2-day split (yes I know I should go more often but this is the only thing I can do consistently so here we are).

I've recently been doing more body-weight exercises to condition leg strength. I've been doing what are called ""mini leg blasters"" (meant for conditioning for the ski season, but I've also found it helps a lot with balance too) which are essentially a superset sprint of: 10xsquats, 10xlunges (5/leg), 10xjumping lunges (5/leg), 5xjumping squats. You're supposed to do 10 minis with rest in between; when I do that I practically end up limping for 3-4 days (despite stretching often, foam rolling thoroughly, and drinking lots of water). 

I thought I'd tone it down and opted for only 5 minis and then (after spending some time working other muscle groups) some light (40 lbs) deadlifts. Almost the same result despite stretching,  foam rolling, drinking water, protein smoothies, etc.

I've noticed my quads get tight VERY quickly during the routine, especially near my knees, even if I did a warm-up beforehand (usually running). Usually the biggest problem with my soreness  is my quads (unsurprising given tightness), which I try to foam-roll  most.  The most problematic area is near my knees towards the inside (which a quick google search tells me is called ""vastus medialis""). This muscle right here is always the most painful and stays sore the longest. I have no idea why this part in particular seems to be the ""weakest"". Shouldn't it catch up eventually?

I feel like this is kind of strange. I figure, OK I'm not an athlete, I can't do 10 minis, but not even 5? It's not like I just started doing them recently either. Has anyone had similar problems? Is there something glaring here that I'm not addressing? Am I overestimating my legs? Am I underestimating how  hard it should be?",2020-02-07 02:07:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/f03fti/muscles_near_knees_quick_to_tighten_excruciating/
ew93ry,xxfitness,"Frustrated, am I doing this right? Weight vs. New Muscle","Hi! I'll try and make this short, but I can't help but feel I am doing something wrong, or that I can do something better.

I'm 5'4, female and 128-130 lbs. I've always been small and active. I've started working out everyday this month, and eating 1400 calories with exercise subtracted out (Fitbit tracking) with 130-150 grams of protein daily. Lifestyle change in the works.

Exercise, I burn 300-400 calories while at the gym. I do 20 mins of cardio and 20 mins of weights.

Ok so my questions, I haven't lost a single pound this month. I track calories through lose it and it says I should be losing about a pound a week. Is muscle growth possibly why I haven't lost any weight? I noticibly have more defined muscles and feel physically stronger.  Is my body just recompositioning or something? Can muscles actually grow and weigh that fast?

Other note, I have a smoothie and fruit everyday and only realized the other day I have 50-70 g of  natural sugar daily. I was SHOCKED! Have switched that up since but is that also a reason?

**Stats**:

|Total Mass:|Fat Mass:|Fat Free Mass:|
|:-|:-|:-|
|133.6 lb|38.4 lb (28.7%)|95.2 lb (71.3%)|

Measurements: 32""-27""-38""

**Background**: From August to May last year, I was pretty consistent with the gym. I would either take a higher rep, lower weight workout class or go for \~3 mile runs working on pace. I lost around 15 pounds during that time, especially since I was walking a lot more (easily 15,000-25,000 steps a day.) I went from \~150 to \~135.

During the summer I didn't really go to the gym (1-2 times per week) but I had a fairly active job outside so I kept up with my activity goals. Throughout the past year, I've also incorporated weightlifting on my own. For that,  I'll usually choose 5-7 movements and rotate through three times (10-15 reps per movement.)

Now I've been back to school for a couple weeks and trying to find a good routine. I felt good at my lowest, 124 lb, so that might be my goal.

**Eating**: I'm vegan gluten free, however that doesn't always mean healthy. I enjoy ice cream too much.. Usually I'll have a banana pb smoothie, soup/pasta, lots of potatoes, salads, oatmeal, hummus with carrots etc. I also love coffee. I don't track calories right now, but I might try it out.

**Goals**: To be honest, I was surprised with how high the Bod Pod put me at. I thought I had a fair bit of muscle making up my weight. I'd like to get a good routine going with eating and exercise in order to lose some body fat (\~4%.)

I'm a lot more comfortable moving around and my clothes fit way better than when I was \~150 lbs, but I still think I could improve some more. For my workouts, I want to build up my distance running- next goal would be a 10k. I also enjoy dance workouts and might try out swimming. Overall, I think the Bod Pod was a good motivator to get more serious with my fitness.

Have you gotten a bod pod scan, if so, do you think it was accurate?

__About you__

I've been working out with a goal of ""wow, she looks like she works out"". But I've gotten addicted to the gains, well, I just want to get better overall - have more muscle, lift more heavy things and put them down. I just want to be able to do things. I'm starting out with some aesthetic and strength goals, and I plan on eventually incorporating more functional strength (being able to do obstacle course races, etc.)


__Current Diet__


I have a goal of counting macros, but it's not always perfect. My current macros split is 215g carbs / 120g protein / 65g fat on training days and 185g carbs / 120g protein / 60g fat on rest days. I would say I'm 7/10 hitting my macros. It goes a little haywire on vacation but I try to eat as intuitively as I can when I can't track. I eat mostly healthy: an easy day of eating for me would be:

* Greek Yogurt, frozen fruit smoothie
* Overnight oats
* White rice, rotisserie chicken, eggs and kimchi
* Tofu, avocado, peanut butter sauce spring rolls
* Protein shake

__Current Routine__


I'm currently running a 5 day 2 push/2 pull split + an extra glute, core, stability focused day. I have an online trainer that I work with (mostly just to keep me accountable and plan my workouts/macros for me). I started with her early February because I was tired of not getting my butt to the gym. Prior to that, I had a good case of ""fuckarounditis"" at the gym for about 1.5 years. I dabbled in compound lifts and bootcamp classes, but there was no set program. Since starting with my trainer (and she hasn't done much for me in terms of guiding me on form besides giving me a good program split every 2 weeks based on my feedback each week, I think I'm fairly well-educated due to this subreddit and personal research), I've been able to see much more progress. This is probably due to actually taking progressive overload seriously, and the fact that I'm paying for it, checking in each week, I haven't missed a day at the gym (even on vacations!). We're doing mostly hypertrophy training with 2 weeks of strength sprinkled in every 1.5 months. My lifts have increased quite a bit in 4 months with 1RM being somewhere around:

* Deadlift - 260lbs
* Squat - 230lbs
* Bench - 135lbs

The good news is I don't feel like I've plateaued yet! I think there are still some good walls to break down and form gains to make. I'm still on a fairly linear progression, I think.

__Going forward__

I'm aiming to lose 10lbs of fat while maintaining the same amount of lean mass. I'm hoping this can be accomplished over the next 4-5 months. Honestly, I'm not taking my programmed HIIT/LISS as seriously as I should be (it's just so boring), but I know that's potentially what's holding me back. Thanks for reading! I really enjoy reading DEXA Scan posts, so I hope this helps some people decide where they want to be, and being heavy set isn't all that bad.",2019-06-28 21:19:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/c6pwgi/dexa_scan_56_160lbs_285_bf_hypertrophystrength/

I hope this wasn't answered elsewhere, I tried searching.

&#x200B;

I have some doubts about how to eat around exercising. I am always hungry late at night (years of hospitality / bar work) and struggle to eat breakfast. I have the time to exercise around 8-9pm (and enjoy it most this way, just something to close the day) and am always hungry after. I have to go to bed around 1am or I won't get up for work. I don't manage to eat a lot at once.

&#x200B;

I've been tracking my eating and exercising every day for like two weeks now and every day I have the dilemma of when to eat. I try to eat as much as I can before 8pm / before exercising to just have a small snack afterwards. I don't manage to eat more than 1500 kcal before I head out for some moving. I am always hungry after and I've mostly been doing banana-soy milk-protein-whatever smoothies. I don't feel like eating eggs at night... I'm not trying to lose weight either, I actually hope to gain some muscle. 

&#x200B;

Is it really so bad to have sugar / carbs an hour or two before bed with all that in mind? Should I get all anxious about this or go on with this if my body feels okay?

So first of all, I'm a 28 year old woman, 5'8"", currently 150 pounds.  
I was always around 140 pounds between 16 and 24 years old. Then I started gaining weight and I eventually became pregnant. I gave birth at a whopping 245 pounds in November 2015.   


Around April 2016, I decided to take matters in my own hands and start eating healthier. Little by little I made permanent changes to my diet and I lost most of my weight just by eating better, without exercise. Now I drink only water, or matcha w/ soy milk in the morning. I did keto for one month in june 2017. I started at 1500 cal/day back in april 2016 and I've been at about 1800 cal/day allowance since approx summer 2017. I've had periods when I didn't pay attention though, but it hasnt affected my weight loss too much, just had me maintain or gain+lose the same 1-2 pounds... I also quit drinking a year ago. I try to eat a varied diet with plenty of veggies, fruits, meats, seafoods. No junk, no premade stuff. Almost all homecooked.   


Now (like this week onwards lol) I'm trying to add more nutrients to my diet and do time restricted eating (10 hour eating window). So I have 3 meals + a nutritive smoothie with some flaxmeal, chia seeds, protein powder n stuff.   
My current TDEE is 2168 calories/day. As mentionned earlier, I restrict at 1800 cal/day approx.  


So that's it for the food.  


Now for exercise :   


A few months ago I decided to add exercise because I want to tone up, build muscle mass, get definition but keep losing fat as my % is high (according to my measurements, this app called Body Measurement Tracker says I have a 31.62 body fat percentage as of today). When I started exercising back in August, I was at about 155-160 pounds (fluctuating). Don't have my measurements from back then though (I started tracking those too late).  


I did David Costa's Strong is the new Sexy 12 week program in august. Took a break after. Started Strong Curves Bootyful Beginnings in November. I try to do 1 or 2 cardio days with 3-4 days of the strong curves workouts. Gotta say I got a bit lazy for the holidays lol   
I have a bunch of equipment and workout at home (single mom with a fulltime job so it's kinda hard for me to find time to go to the gym, so I do it at home) like a bench, barbell, plates, pilates ball, dumbbells, resistance bands, pull up bar... I can get a good workout in with those.   


So, with all this being said; ''what do you need help with?''   


Well, I got this far on my own right? But I wanna do things right and as efficiently as possible. I'm not looking at the scale so much anymore. I want to lose fat, build muscle, get definition (thankfully I don't have much loose skin since I lost the weight kinda slowly, but I'm still pretty ''soft''), kinda focus on glutes for DEM BOOTY GAINZ loll   


I've read about cutting, bulking, recomp... and I'm clueless as to what's best for my situation considering the weight lost so far. I want to keep eating healthy and try to get plenty of nutrients daily. What should I do? Should I up or lower my caloric allowance? Should I bulk then cut? Low more fat first then start strength training? I'm so lost lol  


Please share with me any advice or pointers or suggestions you'd have that I should apply to my plan in order to optimize it all!  


Here are my measurements :   


Chest - 37""  
Waist - 31""  
Hips - 41""  
Left thigh - 22.5""  
Right thigh - 23""  
Left & right calf - 14""  
Left bicep - 10.5""  
Right bicep - 11""  
Left forearm - 9""  
Right forearm - 9.5""  
Neck - 13""  


Recap : Height - 5'8"", weight 150 pounds, daily cal allowance 1800, Strong Curves 3-4x a week + 1-2 days low impact cardio ",2019-01-04 21:23:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/acmuh9/lost_almost_100_pounds_by_eating_better_want_to/
9uqg5z,xxfitness,Can we discuss winter health?,"What do you do when the weather turns frightful to keep your body in tip-top shape? As we know, cold weather means exposing your sweaty skin to harsh climates after a workout sesh. It means fighting off colds. It means less motivation because baby, it's cold outside. 

Hoping to open a discussion about your stay-warm, healthy immune system and ""really want to stay under this blanket"" hacks.

Couple of things I thought of off the bat:

\- Vitamin C supplements in smoothies or shakes

\- What to wear in the cold that can transition inside/outside

\- To walk outside with your hair wet or not? That is the question...

\- \[Without crossing over too much into a beauty sub\], how to keep your skin and hair moisturized 

\- Finding motivation when you wake up and it's dark and you leave work and...it's still dark.

\- SOUP SZN RECIPES

\- What else do you eat that makes you feel cozy and toasty? Veggies and fruit seem SO last season...

\- Mental health break -- darker times means darker minds. How do you keep your Vitamin D levels up when the sun never shines?

\- New year means busier gyms. How do you deal with stress of more people?

9rqmjc,xxfitness,Intense hunger after breakfast smoothie,"A couple mornings a week I'll make myself a smoothie for breakfast. I usually put 50-60g of frozen banana, 35-45g of frozen berries, 56g of frozen spinach, 1 oz of avocado, 1 scoop of vanilla or chocolate whey protein powder, sometimes 6g pb2 and 1/2-3/4 cup of 2% milk before adding water to get the right consistency. I then top it with some granola. I'll eat it around 7 and by 10, sometimes sooner, I'll have intense hunger pangs and audible grumbling. I usually snack in between meals but with other breakfast choices I am sustained for longer and when it does hit my mid-morning hunger isn't so intense.

Am I not putting enough in my smoothie? Should I eat something else with it? If you've had similar experiences, please share what you've done. I'm starting to think I should avoid smoothies as a breakfast item and save them for a snack.

I have noticed a little more fluidity in my joints which is why I started taking it in the first place. Excited to see if hair and skin improve as well.

I am curious to know if there are any plant substitutes out there that compare. Though I am an omnivore I am not thrilled that it comes from cow skins. Plus, don't animal proteins cause inflammation in the GI? It feels silly that I use nut milk in my smoothie to avoid the inflammation from dairy, only to be dumping collagen powder in there.

995tcg,xxfitness,Beginner who plateaued and needs advice,"Background: I'm female, 5'3, and probably around 167lbs (I don't own a scale but this is where my  body naturally sits). About years ago I decided to get my life in check. I did blogilates calendars from about February 2016-May 2016. I ate mostly stir fry, yogurt, smoothies, and a frozen pizza on cheat days. I went from 167lbs to 145lbs and gained a ton of muscle! And I got super flexible. 

It all went downhill when I went to visit a friend for the summer. She got me a job in a restaurant. I walked everywhere and ate very little. By the end of the summer I was still 146/147lbs but by Christmas I'd gained everything back since I wasn't exercising and stopped watching what I ate. 

I've had a tough past couple years. I met the boy of my dreams that summer of 2016 and we've been living together ever since. Jobs have been a struggle but he finally got a full-time job and I have a part-time job while going to University. 

Advice please: I've got MyFitnessPal back and I've been using it for a week. I've calculated that I need to eat 1246 calories a week to lose 1lb a week, and a deficit of 500 calories will make me lose 2lbs a week. I also changed the macros to fit my body type and weight loss plan so my carbs are really low and protein and fat are high. 

I don't have the money to join a gym (and I don't own proper running shoes). I did Pilates because I have asthma and need low intensity workouts (basically no cardio or cardio with lots of breaks). I loved doing Pilates but a few weeks ago I did one calendar day and I needed three to recover. I still walk everywhere (though most places I have nowhere to go). 

I want to be strong, not just skinny. Should I suck it up and start doing Pilates again? Should I just focus on my food intake for now? In the long run I want to lift weights. But honestly I've never been a fitness person and have no idea where to start. I just know Pilates worked last time to lose 20lbs in 4 months while also gaining muscle. 

Also I'm measuring my legs, hips, waist, etc. instead of weighing myself since I don't have a scale. And 145lbs is my goal weight but I think (even with my big bones) I should hover more around 120lbs.

98mktz,xxfitness,Adding coffee to a protein smoothie after a morning workout is amazing,"Maybe I am the only one who hadn't thought of this before, but posting just in case I can help any other caffeine addicts on here!

Anyway, I have been on a kick of making coffee ahead of time and then adding it to my protein smoothie after I do a morning workout. It is AMAZING. I usually add a banana, coco powder, pnut butter powder and other goodies. It turns out fantastic and is a huge breakfast for me with tons of protein. 

Typical recipe for what I make after a long run: 

- 1 banana (frozen if you can think ahead, add ice if you didn't freeze)
- 1 cup of coffee, chilled
- 1/2 cup of almond milk (whatever milk you like)
- coco powder (anywhere around 1-2 tbsp)
- 2 tbsp of peanut butter powder
- 1 or 2 scoops of protein powder (I use pea protein)
- handful of whatever greens you like (I bought a ""super food"" type mix)
- 2 tbsp of collagen powder (optional, I just like it)
- finish off with water or coconut water until you feel like there is enough liquid in the blender


You're end result will be a wonderful chocolate pbutter coffee concoction! Here is a screenshot of the nutrition info from the smoothie I made this morning: https://imgur.com/a/O0ncsmC. I weighed the ingredients as I added them so those numbers should be pretty accurate.

8xz33g,xxfitness,Caffeine and Recovery,"Hi all!

So, I've just hired a personal trainer (reputable, since that seems to have been a concern on other parts of reddit) and he's given me a pretty strict diet. The only thing I'm trying to keep is my unsweetened green tea that I get from Starbucks a few times a week. My question is - is the caffeine in my tea going to keep me from recovering? I don't drink coffee and I gave up my diet cokes a few weeks ago. I have a fruit smoothie I drink mid-morning and I probably drink close to a gallon of water a day. But, I did legs last night and I already know I'm about to have the wrath of that hit me full force tomorrow and want to make sure I'm not prolonging my torture.

8wf4mu,xxfitness,My second (semi) gym experience....much better than the first!,"So the other day I posted [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/8vwbsf/felt_pressured_at_the_gym_today_so_i_left/) about visiting a gym for the first time. To recap, I always workout at home, but I‚Äôm ‚Äúoutgrowing‚Äù my dumbbells, so I‚Äôve been considering joining a gym. I visited one the other day, just for a tour of the facility, but they kept pressing me for my personal info before they would show me around, so I left.


Fast forward to today.... I decided to check out another gym. It‚Äôs a smaller gym, family-owned, and next to the grocery store I use.  I didn‚Äôt really consider it at first because I don‚Äôt get a discount there through my work like the first gym and I knew it would be more expensive, but I decided to check it out.

This experience was MUCH BETTER!  I came in and told the front desk guy that I wanted to check out their facility and he immediately said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy to show you around!‚Äù  And he didn‚Äôt ask for any of my info!  

The facility was really nice‚Äî a good mix of cardio, weight machines, dumbbells, a couple of squat racks, some CrossFit type equipment, a smoothie bar. There was a side room for classes that he said I could use for stretching or whatever if no classes were going on.  The pricing was pretty good too. Not as expensive as I was expecting, and they have an option to pay for 3, 6, or 12 months in advance with NO AUTO RENEWAL!  

He offered me a three-day pass. I told him I wasn‚Äôt working out today, but he gave me the pass and said I could use it anytime. And he never pressed me for any info other than my name to write on the pass. 

I felt much better about the interaction and I‚Äôm really considering it. My hesitation now is that I would need a bit of a tutorial on some of the machines, and definitely on how to use the squat rack, but would it be wrong to ask for help on my ‚Äúfree‚Äù pass?  (A training session is included in the membership, but obviously not for the free pass).

8vk24q,xxfitness,What am I doing wrong? Advice needed.,"Ok...I've been trying to get fit and lose weight for over 2 months now. I am 34 and have gained 30 lbs over the last few years, mostly from being married and living the domestic life (and also eating/drinking as much as my husband does who is a 6'4"" 225lb man). I was always fit and active (equestrian) in my youth and 20's...so I've never had to ""work"" to lose weight until now. I feel like my metabolism now is just...dead.

Now I've gone from being sedentary to doing 1-1.5 hour workouts 5-6 times a week. I do 30-60 min of cardio (treadmill) and then spend the rest of the workout doing free weights or a HIIT workout. Sometimes I will do an hour of yoga instead of the cardio/weights (I have a subscription to Erica Vetra Yoga on PowHow). I also live on a farm and have to do daily chores which is somewhat physical but I think my body has gotten used to that. 

I am in a daily calorie deficit. I have also been doing intermittent fasting along with working out. I fast everyday from 10pm-3pm the next day. As far as diet goes:  no sugar, no alcohol, no processed foods, very low carb (always whole grain). I usually have a light snack after my workout (some celery & protein shake, or smoothie with protein powder) and for dinner I will have a salad or roasted veggies with some lean meat or tofu. I have been very aware of portion sizes and only eat from a small plate for dinner to avoid over eating. I do enjoy a square of dark chocolate after dinner. I also drink over a gallon of water every day. I've tried using MyFitness Pal to count calories but I find I get obsessive and I prefer intuitive eating if at all possible. 

All this effort -more effort than I've ever put in to getting fit- and the scale says I've only lost 6 lbs. I am feeling frustrated to say the least. My goal is to shed that 30 lbs and simply fit into my clothes comfortably again. I should mention I had my thyroid tested about 6 months ago and the results were normal. 

Is my workout just junk? I really dont want to join a gym..I live in the boonies and work from home so actually driving to go workout everyday would be a huge time suck for me. I was thinking about getting some resistance bands and some heavier weights (right now I just have 2-3 lbs) and trying to find some workouts online that incorporate them. 

Any advice? What am I doing wrong here?",2018-07-02 16:36:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/8vk24q/what_am_i_doing_wrong_advice_needed/

The people who say ‚Äúthis workout and smoothie will make your boobs bigger!‚Äù is what I‚Äôm angry about. It‚Äôs false. And encouraging people to do XYZ to look a specific body type that‚Äôs generally unattainable because genetics is disgusting to me. 

If that‚Äôs you then go you. I‚Äôm sorry I hit a nerve to where you feel attacked. I‚Äôm not attacking you. I‚Äôm attacking people who try to sell shit or get likes by spreading false info and telling people to try to look like you or Kim k or whoever the next sexy insta model they can find is. No one should be told they have to look a certain way. Or that we have to get fit to look like what‚Äôs sexy for other people now. Do what inspires you but keep in mind most of it is unrealistic and trying to make a buck off you.

8e4w2w,xxfitness,Question about weight loss/muscle strengthening in a particular area,"Hi! I'm new to this sub but not to necessarily to fitness. For context, I'm about 5'1, 125 pounds, and 20 years old. I gain weight around my thighs, upper arms, boobs and lower abdomen - the rest of me is smaller in comparison to these areas. I think I come under the 'skinnyfat' class - my body resembles the before photos [here](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e3/71/35/e3713596d229e016a37498274504d21c--fitness-before-after--pounds-before-and-after.jpg) and [here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3a/83/6e/3a836e7951a98b1ba0f90c0d92bc96bd.png). I did some research on macros etc last year and attempted to get into a workout routine, which involved counting macros and calories using MyFitnessPal. This didn't work out as I found it to be quite distracting to count calories, and didn't like the MFP calorie estimations - I also found it difficult to find the food combos I eat on the app, so I was always uncertain of how many calories I was actually eating.

I have read the FAQ (very helpful and well written) and completely understand that there is no way you can lose fat from a particular body part - you can't predict where the fat will come off on your body. However, I had a question about targeting certain areas and also about aiming to 'resemble' models or celebrities?

I don't want my body look like any model/celeb in particular, but I do have an idea of what I want my thighs and upper arms to look like. Back in 2014 I was able to reach my goal of slimmer thighs using [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ypfq0Y-SGg) [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZTGgEWPbLk) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8ebTRik9Qw&t=233s) by Psychetruth. I found stretching my legs regularly + 3 times a week inner thigh workout + 4 times a week legs & butt workout was able to reduce the fat quite significantly, making them toned and slimmer. It also made them feel stronger, but they didn't look 'bulky' or anything like that. I was also able to reduce my butt, though I don't really gain weight there.

I'm a huge fan of the strong, muscled thigh look that many rock on Instagram etc. However, as I'm so short, I don't think overly thick thighs would suit my body type. My thighs currently rub together at the top as I have gained weight. They used to be slimmer just above the knee but as I have now gained weight there, they basically look fatter all the way down. I want to shift the fat, then work on the muscle as I don't want them to continue to be this thick; it's uncomfortable and saddening for me as I used to look so different. For context, I put on weight as I used to overeat at meals due to stress. Ironically, these were healthy foods I was consuming, but with no workouts and eating over my daily calorie recommendation most days I was bound to gain weight.

My upper arms are also a massive source of frustration. I have never succeeded in slimming them down or toning them - maybe only slightly. I used to do a lot of ballet 'swan arm' workouts using Mary Helen Bowers' YouTube videos. I recently acquired some 5kg weights and have been doing some lifting - bent over with one knee/hand on a chair, 20 reps on each side (not sure what the name of the exercise is). My problem is probably that I did these workouts in fits and starts, with no regularity and not enough calorie cutting. I used to eat different amounts of food every day - some days almost nothing, some days twice as much as I should for my height and weight. I also had terrible sleeping habits, but I'm working on that. I cannot afford the gym at the moment but I've taken a look at r/bodyweightfitness and am happy to work with what I have atm.

I've been eating intuitively for the past week or so - increasing vegetable portions and reducing all others, basically. I've switched milk and butter for oat milk and coconut oil (for ethical as well as health reasons). I also do not eat cheese. I currently eat fish (wild salmon mostly) about 3 times a week, and have many days where I eat vegetarian (vegetable curry, roasted veg, veggies with rice, avocado toast, yoghurt, eggs very rarely). I also mainly have oatmeal made with water and a splash of coconut cream for breakfast, with some sort of fruit, or a smoothie instead. Sometimes I have chia seed toast, with nothing else. I measure ingredients very carefully now - I used to eat way too much simply because I didn't think about portion size. I don't eat out at all and I don't eat junk food like crisps/biscuits/carbonated drinks/sweets - I never really have. I also don't drink. I don't think I need to change what I eat - just how much (more veg/fruit, less of everything else).

Any advice about reducing and maintaining weight loss, as well as targeting arms and thighs would be really appreciated! I know you guys don't like the word toned here as it's subjective. However, the look and feel of strong yet taut, toned and slim arms and thighs is a major goal for me. I want to improve my core strength massively and try to get abs but my thighs and arms are in a lot worse shape than my abdomen right now, so I'm determined to focus on them and shift the weight there first, using equipment at home.

Another thing is that I'm quite sensitive to the feeling of hunger, so I used to snack regularly due to this. I understand that to lose weight you have to eat at a calorie deficit, but how do you resist the hunger pangs in between meals - especially if you're at work with people around you snacking away at 11am and 3pm and offering you food?

Here's a [pic](https://healthylivingpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/model-legs.png) of what my current thigh and calf shape resembles (bit slimmer and smaller as I'm hella short but that's the general shape). I want to aim for [this](https://i0.wp.com/familyfitnesscenters.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Summer-Legs-Challenge.png) and [this](https://www.fitnessmagazine.com/sites/fitnessmagazine.com/files/sculpt-strong-toned-legs-and-glutes-too_276928.jpg). I also like [this look](https://www.femniqe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/THINNER-THIGHS.jpg) but as this is an obvious pose, I'm not sure if it's something to 'aim' for. Not sure how to plan for this and if it's even possible without the gym :/

My arms currently look similar to [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS3woFfe1VRW_4dRgPNKeSAwZeU9zlK7HklbaQ78vqz9bpMSnVK) and [this](https://thumb9.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/166839848/1007572012/stock-photo-woman-in-sports-bra-pinching-arm-fat-on-a-white-background-1007572012.jpg).

88v5di,xxfitness,Is it okay to eat pretty much the exact same thing every day if its healthy?,"I'm trying to gain muscle and weight. I work out 4 days a week, for at least an hour (legs 2X, glutes 3X, upper body 3X per week). I also really want to eat healthy, and just downloaded the myfittnesspal app.


This being said, I work a very busy schedule and am normally exhausted by the time I get home and work out. If I can just have the same healthy food every day, that would save me SO much time and energy. (I've checked- the food I eat every day meets my needed macros)


If it helps, I have: Breakfast- cheerios and coconut milk. Snack- 600 calorie homemade smoothie. Lunch- steel cut oats. After work snack- 3 egg whites and cheddar cheese. Dinner- the only thing that changes day to day.


The only thing from this point on that would change day to day would be my dinner, which I'll either have fish, chicken, or turkey, with a green veggie and sweet potatoes or quinoa.

7wmvgq,xxfitness,Need help with new diet plan,"29 [F] 5'3"" 118lbs

I had a stable weight all my life as long as I ate clean. Now, I am on a contraceptive that is renown for weight gain and I am struggling to stay stable.

To go in a little bit of details, 6 months ago my iron was depleted to the point where I needed intravenous iron infusion. One semi-long term solution for that problem was to stop my menses with depo-provera.

I gained 7lbs in the course of a month, mostly around my hips. Dieting is new territory for me; I don't really know what I am doing and I've never restricted myself prior to this. 

Here is my meal plan including macros: https://www.eatthismuch.com/dietset/326148911/

It consists of 1800cal/day. I weight everything so I am assuming that the caloric calculation is correct. I eat at 8am, 12pm, and 6pm I exercise the same as before: I work standing up and go rock climbing 3 times a week. I used to eat at any time of the day, a cereal bowl before bed was not uncommon, double portions where a thing too.

I've been trying it for a week now and I managed gain 0.2lbs(not enough to consider it a real weight gain, but still). Some days I do fine but others I can barely get through, especially yesterday where I had to shovel for one hour in the morning before work.

I was recommended: intermitted fasting, go down to 1500cals or to replace the smoothie with eggs. I am not a fan of lowering my cal intake even more as I am already finding it very difficult. ",2018-02-10 17:42:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/7wmvgq/need_help_with_new_diet_plan/

That's pretty much the bottom line. I either get lazy or busy or just flat out don't feel like eating them by the time I get home. So I want to start adding in a ""green smoothie"". I don't need it to taste amazing, and it doesn't *have* to be green. 

I'm wondering if you guys can help me out with what would be the most nutrient-dense things to add to the smoothie. I'm planning to add a little protein powder because I'm also crap at getting enough protein, though I don't want this to be too caloric because I'm in weight-loss mode and prefer to eat my calories. 

I read up on the whole blending spinach and water and making ice cubes deal, and plan to do that. Probably kale as well. Other than that I am a little lost. When I google it, most of the smoothies have way more fruit than veggies, and seem to be more about taste than nutrients. As of now I'd just planned to add some apple and/or pineapple to help with the taste a little. I usually eat an apple or banana most days anyway.

Thanks for any suggestions you guys have!

My hair has been falling out like crazy (started taking iron supps again to help out with that and energy levels).

Does anyone have any experience drinking this kind of protein broth powder and how to mask its flavor (i.e. smoothie, baking)? It's REALLY strong... I tried mixing about a third serving of it with a scoop of chocolate protein and it was like I was drinking a chocolate vanilla chicken milkshake. Thanks everyone!

6vzm4i,xxfitness,What do you eat for pre and post workout- if anything?,"I have been eating fairly healthy for most of my adult life, although I often go through swings of good and better phases. I don't count macros or calories, as it brings me too close to my eating disorder of high school. However, I do regularly attempt to eat a balanced amount of protein, healthy fats, complex carbs, and fruits and vegetables and such.

Recently I've begun to work out more regularly as well, something that I was never that good at. This includes some cardio/dance each day but I've also begun doing light weights and more strength building exercises. What smart types of snacks should I be consuming before or after my workout? I eat pretty organic and natural and honestly am kind of hesitant to buy actual preworkout on the shelf. I'm looking for suggestions of food that could help energize me before and repair muscle after- I don't want to be struggling through these workouts and then not fuel my body efficiently! Honestly, I don't even know what types of macros you are supposed to eat before or after strength building regimens.

If it makes a difference, I usually do my workouts a few hours after I wake up. Usually, I eat a smoothie with lots of greens and fruit or a egg, bean + vegetable hash for breakfast. I often don't eat again until lunch, unless I'm really fatigued and famished, and then I'll eat some peanut or almond butter with a banana or something similar.

tldr: new to regular exercise and looking for snack/food ideas to consume before my workouts for fuel and after for muscle repair. ",2017-08-25 16:34:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/6vzm4i/what_do_you_eat_for_pre_and_post_workout_if/
6s0724,xxfitness,Confessions: Do you have a weird food combo and/or night routine that you love?,"As a single lady who really enjoys my own oh-so-adult lifestyle (*cough* I'm 30), I question the normalcy of some of my habits.

I toyed with asking this question from either a positive or negative perspective:

1) Ughhh....Why do I do this weird song and dance every night (even if I'm not hungry)?

2) This is the healthy, albeit silly, snack and routine I have found that I enjoy before bed! 

Let's go with 2. though it feels silly doing it, I realize it's probably not that weird and it's simply my night routine. It doesn't mean it's bad! (Look at this positive self talk!)

In my quest to get off of my added sugar addiction, I finally started making this snack after dinner: An almond milk protein shake with vegan pea protein powder (Stevia sweetened) before bed. Sounds normal, right? 

Well now, it's become a production. I first blob natural peanut butter in on top of the protein scoop, mix it up so the pb and powder sorta squish together, shred up a date or two,  sometimes chop up a half of a frozen banana, add some cocoa powder and/or cinnamon, and then pour in the almond milk over the mix.

You'd think I was making a shake, right? Or at least I was gonna mix that all up? Nah, that's no fun!

Instead, I eat it just like that. Slowly. I watch one episode of whatever show I'm currently watching, and nosh on this weird combo in bed. I love the peanut butter and chocolate chunks at the bottom, sometimes with the sweet date or banana pieces mixed in.

It's sorta like a liquid ice cream sundae with toppings, right? Only... they're on the bottom. Like a surprise.

The only thing I hate about this is that now I look forward to it so much (and it's become quite a calorie hit if I'm not careful) and I want it every single night! I think it's great if I've trained that day, but I have it even when I haven't, or even when I'm not hungry! It's this mental ""thing"" that I need this or my night isn't complete. I could cut down on my calories earlier in the day, but part of me doesn't know if I need to. (I'm 5'4'', 121 lb, training an upper/lower 4 day split plan about 1 hour each w/o, maybe 1 day of cardio a week in the form of 30 minutes on/off sprints, a HIIT class or bootcamp, or a 3-4 mile run. Office job, but at least I stand! I also live in London and walk everywhere). 

What's your weird food vice and/or must-do night routine? Does anyone else not mix up their smoothie and eat it chunky-style? 

Also...do I need to be concerned based off my stats? Or just enjoy?",2017-08-06 19:00:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/6s0724/confessions_do_you_have_a_weird_food_combo_andor/

Brief background: When I was in my mid to late twenties a decade ago, my back would buckle in pain when I stood too long. I was 20-25lbs overweight, and after incorporating juicing over the course of half a year, I lost the excess weight and felt amazing. Had no pain at all. I basically had a big juice in the morning, are fruit all day, and maybe had a small lunch then dinner. Doctor told me smoothies are better for fiber, so I switched and gradually went back to eating whatever and not worrying about calories. 

Wondering if it's simply because I'm 20-25lbs overweight again or if it's due to inflammation from bad diet, but I feel achy again. Wanting something long term other than a juice fast as I am not a vegan and think that is a short term solution to a management problem.

And yet, dietary calcium has been studied to NOT have the same risks that[ supplemental calcium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31625814/) have. Though this is not a surprise, I wish more people would realize that supplemental nutrients are not the same as food nutrients but that could be a whole other post on its own.

They do have a few other trace minerals and nutrients but from my research they seem to be negligible sources. BUT another thing that justifies my weird habit is the fact that by eating a whole hardboiled egg I am also eating the eggshell membrane that is typically thrown away. This membrane is a very good source of collagen,¬†elastin, and hyaluronic acid eating it can indeed have[ anti-wrinkle benefits](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4597828/). 

  
""But what about salmonella""

Well that's why I say hard boiled so that I can ensure I eliminate any risk of salmonella on the eggshell. I supposed if you wanted to be civilized you could grind the eggshell into a powder and add it to a shake or smoothie or something. I personally like to eat it whole while I make eye contact with the mailman as he delivers my mail. 

As a caveat I make sure not to always do this because I don't necessarily have a calcium deficiency or anything and too much of any one nutrient can have consequences. ",2025-07-10 15:48:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1lwg5js/i_sometimes_eat_a_hardboiled_egg_with_the/
1locoi2,Biohackers,Avmacol vs Prostaphane,"Hi friends :)

I dunno if this the right sub to post this question, but I couldn‚Äôt find a better one.

I tried incorporating broccoli sprouts and seeds into my smoothie, but they literally taste and smell so foul that it made it completely undrinkable for me. It‚Äôs legit like a rotten corpse or something. 

So, I‚Äôve been looking into supplements. 

Prostaphane is cheaper in my country. Especially if you buy the big packs when they‚Äôre on sale, they become reasonably affordable per pill.

Avmacol has a much fancier looking bottle, but it‚Äôs quite pricy and it‚Äôs more difficult for me to get my hand on. Prostaphane‚Äôs packaging just looks like prescription medication. 

Anyway, what‚Äôs the best option you reckon? I‚Äôm a blonde and I have no idea how to interpret studies and suchlike üôÉ

Thank you!

1liehen,Biohackers,New to biohacking stack,"###Shorter version:
Omega-3, B12, Creatine (w/ Chia Seeds), L-Theanine, 15g coffee grounds (~300+ caffeine) have made my brain a machine, ‚Äúno placebo‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm very sorry if this is too long!
###Longer version:
I‚Äôm a student and was tired of constant zoning out when reading or watching lectures. I was researching how to focus better and that led me here. 

After a bit of reading others post, and doing some light research on certain vitamins(?), I decided I‚Äôd take Omega-3 with B12. I was already taking Creatine due to my gym life. 

It was very subtle, and I may be sensitive to these things, or placebo, but I noticed a shift in focus after a bit of time. 

It‚Äôs been about 2 months of the above supplements and I now added L-Theanine, because I‚Äôm addicted to coffee, like everyone else, and the little research I did, I found that it could help me take advantage of the focus attribute coffee gives and avoid the anxiety and jitters.

MAIN POINT: I didn‚Äôt take anything yesterday and felt the worst brain fog and desire to brain rot (I try to avoid dopamine heightening screen time until after 5pm).

I was drained when I went to sleep last night and today I woke up and went to the gym but with no desire of anything but wanting to mindlessly scroll. 

I got back from the gym, made my ‚Äúpower‚Äù smoothie‚Äù and took my supplements (omega-3, b12, L-Theanine) and chugged my creatine water. 

I succumbed to my desire to brain rot and tried justifying it by saying I was on tik tok to ‚Äúwatch educational‚Äù content. And I was, but then I felt it. A hard shift of focus, a fuzzy/warm feeling on my forehead, and the locking in/narrowing in sensation. I quickly got off tik tok, to well procrastinate a bit to share this lol. But now I go study! 

But I wanted to share my ‚Äúquick‚Äù testimony of how these brain stack stuff works, or at least for me. And I‚Äôm sure it isn‚Äôt placebo because I took my stuff without a care or desire to go through my day, I was tempted to brain rot and sleep.

1l3f93h,Biohackers,5 Benefits of Kefir‚Äîthe Fermented Superfood You Should Be Drinking Daily,"Kefir is often recommended for gut health, and for good reason. It has many beneficial bacteria and yeasts, including various strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Regular consumption has been linked to improved digestion, enhanced immune response, and better microbial diversity.

But as beneficial as kefir is, not everyone can‚Äîor wants to‚Äîdrink it. While it can be used creatively in smoothies, salad dressings, or even overnight oats, some people don‚Äôt like the taste or texture, others avoid dairy, and for some, it just doesn‚Äôt fit their routine.

If kefir isn‚Äôt a good fit for you, there are several other ways to support gut health naturally:

‚Ä¢ Increase prebiotic fiber intake. Foods like onions, garlic, leeks, bananas, and oats help feed beneficial gut bacteria.

‚Ä¢ Eat other fermented foods. Sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, and kombucha can offer live cultures and microbial diversity.

‚Ä¢ Stay well-hydrated. Water supports the mucosal lining of the intestines and helps with overall digestion.
	
‚Ä¢ Manage stress and sleep. Both directly influence the gut-brain axis and the balance of gut bacteria.
	
‚Ä¢ Exercise regularly. Physical activity is associated with increased microbial diversity and better gut motility.


What About Probiotics?

For those who want more targeted support, a well-formulated probiotic supplement can be helpful‚Äîbut there‚Äôs a big quality gap in the market that many people aren‚Äôt aware of.

One strain worth knowing about is Lactobacillus plantarum. It‚Äôs been widely studied and is known for its ability to:

‚Ä¢ Help reduce gas, bloating, and discomfort
	
‚Ä¢ Strengthen the intestinal barrier

‚Ä¢ Survive exposure to stomach acid better than many other strains

‚Ä¢ Interact with the immune system in beneficial ways

However, how a probiotic is delivered matters just as much as which strain it contains. Many traditional probiotics‚Äîespecially cheaper or generic store-bought options‚Äîlack the proper delivery system to get the bacteria through the stomach and into the intestines alive. Without that protection, the bacteria are often destroyed by stomach acid before they can do any good.

This is where enteric-coated capsules come in. These capsules are designed to resist stomach acid and dissolve only once they reach the small intestine, increasing the chances that the bacteria remain viable and effective.

Why This Matters:

Many people take probiotics faithfully and feel no difference‚Äîoften because the product they‚Äôre using doesn‚Äôt deliver live bacteria where they‚Äôre needed. The strain, the dosage, the delivery method, and storage conditions (like whether it requires refrigeration) all matter more than flashy marketing or high CFU numbers.

Whether you get your probiotics through kefir, food, or supplements, the key is making informed choices that work for your individual needs and digestive system.

1knw49e,Biohackers,"Is this the Ultimate Bio hack using DNA testing, Genetic Reports and LLM's?","So in short.

Got my DNA test through Ancestry.

Uploaded the data into Genetic Genie at first. Got insights.

Then found Genetic Life Hacks, paid for a monthly subscription, downloaded all the reports in one click. 119 pages.

Then fed it into Claude, chat gpt and chat gpt deep research. (The deep research took ages, but it produced a very in-depth report I can understand based on my results)

And then prompted all 3 to highlight the red flags and green flags.

Then I went down the red flag list 1 by 1 creating a supplement plan along the way.

I did this multiple times across multiple GPTS as a stop gap to get the most accurate information.

I then went and spoke to naturopaths at my local health food store confirming my findings and cross referencing the AI's feedback with their personal experience.

So far its been very effective.

These are my red flags -

# üö© Red Flags Affecting Energy, Focus, and Productivity

# 1. COMT Met/Met (rs4680 A/A) ‚Äì Low COMT enzyme activity

* **What it does:** Slower breakdown of dopamine, adrenaline, and norepinephrine.
* **Why it matters:** Can cause **mental fatigue**, overwhelm, **sensitivity to stress**, and difficulty focusing under pressure. Often leads to mental overactivity or racing thoughts, especially in high-stimulus environments.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Wired-but-tired feeling, overstimulation, anxious procrastination, mental crash after stress.

# 2. MAOA High-Activity (rs6323 G/G) ‚Äì Faster serotonin & dopamine breakdown

* **What it does:** Reduces levels of calming neurotransmitters like serotonin more quickly.
* **Why it matters:** Can lead to **lower baseline mood**, **less resilience to stress**, and a higher likelihood of fatigue or burnout in high-demand environments.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Flat mood, irritability, low motivation, sensitivity to sleep loss.

# 3. SOD2 Ala/Ala (rs4880 A/A) ‚Äì Weaker mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme

* **What it does:** Reduces your ability to clear mitochondrial oxidative stress.
* **Why it matters:** Leads to **less efficient cellular energy production**, and **faster mitochondrial fatigue**, especially under stress, high training loads, or poor sleep.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Physical tiredness, sluggishness, headaches, or fatigue that hits earlier in the day than it should.

# 4. GSTM1 Null (gene deleted) ‚Äì Reduced detox capacity

* **What it does:** Limits your ability to detox free radicals and chemical byproducts.
* **Why it matters:** If exposed to toxins, pollution, poor diet, or stress, you‚Äôll accumulate oxidative stress **faster**, which wears down energy and mental clarity.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Brain fog, slower recovery, fatigue after alcohol or junk food, sluggish mornings.

# 5. MTHFR A1298C Homozygous (rs1801131 G/G) ‚Äì Mild methylation bottleneck

* **What it does:** Slightly reduces conversion of folate to its active form.
* **Why it matters:** May cause **lower neurotransmitter and energy molecule production**, especially if B2, B6, folate, or B12 are suboptimal.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Low mental energy, slow mental start in the morning, difficulty focusing, more tired on low-carb or low-protein diets.

# 6. FMO3 Variants + BHMT Heterozygous ‚Äì Choline and methylation backup pathway compromise

* **What it does:** Reduces efficiency of homocysteine recycling and choline metabolism.
* **Why it matters:** Choline is needed for acetylcholine (key for focus), methylation (energy + detox), and liver function. Low choline = low productivity.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Afternoon slumps, foggy thinking, or mental fatigue with low-protein intake or skipping eggs/meat.

# 7. DAO Variants (rs10156191 + rs2052129) ‚Äì Histamine intolerance

* **What it does:** Slows breakdown of dietary histamine.
* **Why it matters:** **High histamine = brain fog, anxiety, disrupted sleep**, and even energy crashes after eating high-histamine foods (wine, cheese, aged meat, leftovers).
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Energy swings, headaches, irritability after meals, trouble winding down at night.

Supplements I have started taking and will be adding to my existing stack:

# ‚úÖ Suggested Integration Plan (No Overlap, Best Timing)

# üöÄ Morning (Fasting window) ‚Äî Focus + Dopamine Priming

Take with water or light liquid:

* NAC
* L-Tyrosine
* Alpha-GPC
* TMG
* ALCAR
* Mega Magnesium
* Cordyceps
* B-complex
* Zinc
* Alpha Lipoic
* CoQ10
* Fusion Memory
* Stress Ease
* Theanine

‚úÖ *Optional: add 5‚Äì10g sunflower lecithin in liquid (coffee or shake) for early choline support*

# üçΩ 12:30 PM (Meal 1 ‚Äì Break Fast) ‚Äî Dopamine Receptor Growth

Take with food + fats:

* Uridine Monophosphate (300mg)
* Fish Oil (for DHA synergy)
* Sunflower Lecithin (add remainder to meal/smoothie)
* Primal Multi
* Primal Body
* Liver Care
* Methyl B12 + L-Methylfolate
* DIM + I3C with PQQ

# üåô Night (Before Bed) ‚Äî Recovery + Neurobalance

* Switch Nutrition Sleep
* Body Ripped GABA
* Optional: L-Theanine (if needed)

# üîÑ Optional Cycling Notes

* **L-Tyrosine** ‚Äì can be skipped 1‚Äì2x per week to avoid overstimulation (especially COMT Met/Met)
* **Uridine Monophosphate** ‚Äì cycle 5 days on / 2 off or 4 weeks on / 1 off
* **Alpha-GPC** ‚Äì consider cycling opposite uridine if you want to test sensitivity changes
* **DIM** ‚Äì monitor over time; may not need to take continuously

I am still in the process of ordering and being shipped a few supps.

A major AHA moment came today with this little gem:

DRD2 A1 allele (reduced dopamine receptor density) Your reward system might not feel the ‚Äúhit‚Äù from slow progress ‚Äî you need stronger stimuli or more novelty to stay engaged. This makes you crave the start of something new, but disengage when the grind starts. So I should take this?

Uridine Monophosphate (150‚Äì300mg) ‚Üí Supports dopamine receptor density (especially helpful with your DRD2 A1) ‚Üí Great for long-term mood and drive stability

I am getting Uridine next week and combined with choline and fish oil and I cant wait to see what happens.

\------------------------------------------------

This week though ive added in Herbs of gold Stress Ease and Liver Care, COq10 and NAC.

And I've felt the best i have in years. I think a lot of my trouble was clearing away the toxins and also supporting my slow COMT gene with adaptogens like rhodiola and Ashwaghanda (which is in Stress Ease)

I am more focus, clear headed, less time chronically tired and overall feel much lighter already and I have only just started.

**TL;DR**¬†

Using my DNA, Genetic health reports and LLMS I built a personalized supplement stack and I am already seeing fantastic results within the first week of trying it.

1kf8dzo,Biohackers,Whey Protein Isolate and Amino Acids MAP,"I'm looking to supplement my protein intake as I find it challenging to get enough through regular meals. A friend in Europe who is very knowledgeable about fitness has suggested Whey Protein Powder (isolate) and essential amino acids (MAP). I don't know if MAP is a specific brand or a type of amino acids and she is preparing for an event so I don't want to bombard her with questions.¬†¬†She mentioned that using both (whey protein and amino acids MA) is beneficial, even though many people tend to use one or the other.¬†

1. I would appreciate your recommendations for a good whey protein isolate powder available in the US.
2. Regarding protein powder usage, I understand the general guideline is 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. Could you share your thoughts on the best way to incorporate protein powder into my daily routine? For example, would it be more effective to take a larger serving (like two scoops) in a morning smoothie with fruit and coconut milk and then focus on reaching my remaining protein needs through real food at lunch and dinner? Or would you suggest splitting the intake, perhaps with one scoop in the morning and another at night?
3. As I said above, my¬†friend also mentioned specific essential amino acids called MAP. Are you familiar with any reputable brands or sources for these in the US?
4. She also suggested that the combination of whey protein and MAP could improve skin health by providing the necessary building blocks for collagen production. Have you or anyone you know experienced any skin improvements from taking both?
5. Additionally, she recommended taking 5 grams of creatine daily. I'm aware there are varying opinions on creatine supplementation. Do you have any experience with creatine IN ADDITION to whey protein and amino acids, and if so, what dosage do you find effective?

For context, I primarily lift weights at home using the Heather Robertson program. My goal isn't to bulk up significantly, but rather to maintain my current muscle mass and perhaps make slight improvements.

I use a yogurt maker for the warm spot. You can use literally any milk you want, dairy milk, coconut milk, etc, doesn't matter. 

After 24 hours you will see separation of the liquid and solids, this means fermentation has taken place. If you see no evidence of fermentation...guess what? your expensive probiotic is bunk, worthless junk that does nothing. I have tested several that turned out like that. 

After 24 hours shake it up vigorously then put in frig. Drink small amounts every day. Add to smoothies or whatever.

* **1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil**
* **1 tablespoon of black seed oil (Nigella sativa)**

I‚Äôm doing this primarily for the anti-inflammatory and gut-healing benefits. I‚Äôve read quite a bit about the benefits of high-quality fats, especially for people with autoimmune issues, which I‚Äôve been dealing with.

* I eat clean otherwise‚Äîno processed food, no refined sugar, and I avoid gluten/dairy.
* I treat this as a form of supplementation, not cooking oil. I drink them directly or sometimes mix into smoothies.

1j3xfb6,Biohackers,Cravings vs Willpower: why sequence matters,"Cravings do not reflect weak self-control. They follow a clear biological chain reaction triggered by glucose spikes and crashes.

Every time glucose spikes, insulin floods in to clear the excess. Sometimes insulin overshoots, causing glucose to dip too low. That dip flips the craving switch in the brain, making food feel urgent, even if you are full. Granola, smoothies, or even so-called healthy snacks can start this cycle.

Yale fMRI scans show the craving center lights up when glucose crashes. This is not a mental flaw or a lack of discipline. The fastest way to break the cycle is not to cut all carbs, but to change how meals are built.

Eating vegetables first slows glucose absorption. Protein at breakfast steadies blood sugar for the rest of the day. A spoon of vinegar before meals blunts glucose release. Moving after eating gives muscles a chance to clear glucose before insulin has to.

For me, changing the order of eating reduced cravings by half. No cutting carbs. No calorie math. Just learning how glucose works.

Has anyone here tried meal sequencing? I am collecting stories like this with others tracking glucose patterns at r/MetabolicKitchen . If you have tested your own strategies, come share them.",2025-03-05 07:05:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1j3xfb6/cravings_vs_willpower_why_sequence_matters/
1izkgja,Biohackers,"Continuous Glucose monitor overestimates Glycemia, with the magnitude of bias varying by postprandial test and individual ‚Äì A randomized crossover trial","# Background

Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are used to characterize postprandial glycemia, yet no study has directly tested how different test foods/beverages alter CGM accuracy.

# Objective

Assess glycemic responses to test foods/drinks using CGM¬†*versus*¬†capillary sampling (criterion).

# Methods

Fifteen healthy females(*n*=9) and males(*n*=6) completed 7 laboratory visits in a randomized crossover design with ‚â•48h washout between visits. During each visit, participants consumed an oral carbohydrate challenge comprising either 50g glucose(CONTROL), or equivalent carbohydrate as whole-fruits(WHOLE), blended-fruits(BLEND), commercial fruit smoothie(PRODUCT), commercial smoothie ingested over 30¬±4min(SLOW), commercial smoothie with 5g inulin(FIBER), commercial smoothie providing 30g carbohydrate(DOSE). Glycemia was recorded from both CGM and capillary samples every 15min for 120min and expressed as incremental areas under the curve(iAUC). Glycemic index(GI) was calculated relative to CONTROL where appropriate. Exploratory analyses examined 1) inter-individual heterogeneity of CGM bias¬†*versus*¬†criterion; and 2) whether CGM bias could be improved with adjustment for baseline differences.

# Results

CGM-estimated fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations were(mean¬±SD) 0.9¬±0.6 and 0.9¬±0.5 mmol/L higher than capillary estimates, respectively(both,¬†*p*<0.001). CGM bias varied by postprandial test such that GI for PRODUCT was higher with CGM(69, 95%CI: 48, 99)¬†*versus*¬†capillary(53, 95%CI: 40,69;¬†*P*=0.05). Furthermore, differences in CGM¬†*versus*¬†capillary fasting glucose concentrations varied by participant(*p*=0.001). Unadjusted, CGM overestimated time >7.8mmol/L by ‚àº4-fold, and adjustment for baseline differences reduced this overestimate to ‚àº2-fold(both¬†*p*<0.01).

# Conclusions

CGM overestimated glycemic responses in numerous contexts. At times this can mischaracterize the GI. In addition, there is inter-individual heterogeneity of the accuracy of CGM to estimate fasting glucose concentrations. Correction for this difference reduces, but does not eliminate, postprandial overestimate of glycemia by CGM. Caution should be applied when inferring absolute or relative glycemic responses to foods using CGM, and capillary sampling should be prioritised for accurate quantification of glycemic response.

Did full panel bloodwork as I've struggled with a myriad of mental health issues and wanted more insight. Have high cholesterol for my age and liver enzymes show some indication of fatty liver. 

Otherwise, showing that I have mostly heathy ranges on my bloodwork. 

Mentally my drive is medium/low without some form of stimulant. I drink 2-3 coffees per day. Libido is low. Energy levels feel sub optimal. I work in Sales and sit most of the day, also live in a place with limited sunlight exposure at the moment. 

Here's what I'm doing to combat it right now:

* Lifting weights 3-6 times per week, high intensity
* 15 min of cardio \~3 times per week
* Sauna for 15-30 minutes, 3-5 times per week
* Sleep before 11, wake at 8:30 (3mg Liposomal melatonin + sleep mask)
* Eliminated refined sugars besides honey 
* Eliminated dairy and grain products 
* Eliminated 90% processed foods
* Rare use of boxers/briefs - mainly cotton when using
* Supplement list for test includes: Boron (3mg), Shilajit, Zinc (50mg), Beef Organ Supplement, Pine Pollen Tincture, butea superba (800mg powder, 33mg extract), Methylated B complex.  

  
Diet currently is pretty restrictive, as I'm working on an intense gut healing protocol. The daily diet looks like:

**Breakfast:** huge morning smoothie with mixed berries, avocado, spinach, broccoli sprouts, 10-20g fiber, 25G collagen, and more. Aiming for 50-60g protein. 

**Lunch:** 250g Ground beef, sweet potato, olive oil, sauerkraut, lettuce

**Snack:** Sardines, Dates, dark chocolate, Raw honey

**Dinner:** Chicken/beef, sweet potato, mixed root veggies. 

I add salt/mineral packs to my water.

I am 100% sober.

  
I've been following this for about a month and feeling definitely better, however I'm looking to absolutely maximize this and get my levels to like 700+ at least. I'm convinced this is a root problem of many of my issues mentally has to do with my test being low, or my test being low is hinting at a deeper root cause. I did blood work back at age 23-24 and had very similar numbers. For additional context, I smoked a shit load of weed from age 14-22 and figure that has crashed my test in development.

I live in NYC so I walk quite a bit but this year I'm looking to incorporate an actual workout routine with strength training. (I've noticed muscle mass decreases since I turned 30).

I don't have issues sleeping most of the time. If any restlessness, it's mostly due to light levels (ex. full moon brightness can keep me up and I should look into darker shades).

I used to add flax oil and collagen powder to my morning smoothie, and take Fish Oil and a Probiotic. But I was in my mid 20's so I didn't really notice anything and stopped around 4 years ago.

I don't have any health issues besides feeling burnt-out mentally, and I do have a bit of PCOS. I struggle with a bit of acne and I'm starting to see signs of aging in my face - but thats pretty much it.

1hwkn8m,Biohackers,Should I Take Creatine?,"A review of literature in the efficacy of creatine supplementation: Not intended as medical advice.

I see this question being asked a lot more, and I think that‚Äôs because in spite of creatine being relatively ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù, the stream it was mostly found in was the mass of people looking to improve their physical performance and appearance, with the added hope of putting on some serious muscle. Of course, creatine is not going to magically give you rippling delts, huge lats, and a 6-pack to boot. But now, it seems that ‚Äòregular‚Äô people are showing a lot more interest. 

I‚Äôm not sure where that interest stems from, but it‚Äôs certainly worth diving into creatine as a supplement and whether your mom should be dipping into your supplement cupboard to sneak a scoop. 

So, what is creatine and should you supplement with it?

Creatine is a naturally occurring compound synthesized from the amino acids glycine and arginine, and is predominantly stored in skeletal muscles and the brain. It plays a critical role in regenerating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy carrier in cells, thereby supporting energy intensive activities - running, lifting weights, and even cognition.

Because of the importance of creatine the body creates it endogenously, meaning it produces it without having to obtain it through it dietary sources, although it is also contained in foods like red meat and seafood, but this is where supplementation comes into play - is your boy making enough for you to perform optimally? Certainly, if you can walk around, run, lift weights etc. you have a sufficient amount being made and obtained through your diet, but what about if you want to perform even better, run further, get those extra reps, and maybe even eek out a few extra marks on that test or find those key words during a presentation, is creatine the answer? Based on hundreds of studies performed over the last couple of decades, the likely answer is yes!

Impact on Muscular Performance and Strength

Extensive research has demonstrated that creatine supplementation enhances muscular performance, particularly during high-intensity, short duration exercises such as weightlifting and sprinting. A study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition reported that creatine supplementation, combined with resistance training, significantly increased muscle strength across various populations (Wang et al., 2024). Now, if living and living well until you turn 100 is a goal of yours like it is mine, than you should know just how important strength is as you age. Want to pick up your grand or great-grand kids? What about travelling? Those suitcase wheels aren‚Äôt going to put it into the overhead compartment for you. And oh no, the elevator is down (as it always is) are you going to spend the next 48 hours in the lobby waiting for the repairman? Not if you‚Äôve got well established strength! Additionally, a review in Sports Medicine found that creatine use can increase maximum power and performance in high-intensity anaerobic repetitive work by 5-15%, that may not seem like much, but ask any gym bro if they want to increase their bench press by 15% and they‚Äôll ask where they need to stick the needle‚Ä¶ maybe its not that impressive, but for a regular person this could be the addition of an extra 1-2 reps per exercise, or a faster sprint. It also means overtime becoming stronger and improving your performance and ability to handle strenuous activity, which in turn benefits almost every physical process in your body - think arterial and cardiovascular system.

Effects on Cognition

Beyond its physical benefits, creatine has been investigated for its potential cognitive advantages. A systematic review in Experimental Gerontology indicated that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning might be improved by creatine supplementation, though results across studies	were conflicting. Another study in Scientific Reports found that a single does of creatine (5g) improved cognitive performance and induced changes in cerebral high-energy phosphates during sleep deprivation.

For those that struggle with sleep, creatine may also be a useful addition to one‚Äôs morning smoothie or on the side of a cup of coffee, especially on days where you were only able to clock 3-5 hours. A 2024 study that subjected participants to 3-5 hours of sleep per night were then given supplemental creatine. The results showed that participants receiving creatine showed better results in both cognitive and physical tests than the control group. 


Additional Benefits

Neuroprotection and the delaying of certain neurodegenerative diseases has become far more mainstream, rightly so. Clinical trials involving creatine supplementation have examined it‚Äôs use in the treatment and delaying of progression and symptoms in Huntington‚Äôs Disease (HD) and Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. In one double blind study doses of up to 30 grams of creatine were administered to participants daily, while the other group received a placebo. MRI looked at brain atrophy at different times throughout the study to examine disease progression and brain atrophy. It was found at the 6 month mark through MRI that the participants receiving creatine showed lower rates of brain atrophy compared to the placebo group, suggesting the creatine may be useful in slowing the progression of HD. Of course, we have to consider this is only one study, and 30 grams is a fairly significant does compared to what is recommended for the general population, but the mechanism by which they believe creatine to be neuroprotective by providing additional ATP resources to the brain appear to attenuate the disease‚Äôs impact on the brain. 




Dosing and Safety
Creatine has repeatedly been found to be safe for most people with few side effects apart from gastrointestinal issues in some individuals, especially at higher doses, above 5 grams per day. There are always exceptions, and anyone that may have kidney disease or that is taking prescription medication that may impact kidney function should be cautioned when considering supplementing with creatine. As with all supplements, consideration and discussion with their physician is recommended. The typical recommended dose is 5g, though it would appear higher dosing, in the 10g, 15g, even 30g range depending is tolerated, depending on your reason for supplementing with creatine will likely dictate the amount needed. For muscular strength and performance 5g seems to be sufficient, though someone carrying a significant amount of muscle may require more. It would also appear that there are diminishing returns and taking 20g+ would not be more beneficial, unless looking for neurological benefits, though I think larger and more studies are needed to support the use of creatine in those applications. Finally, there has often been discussion about ‚Äòloading phases‚Äô, where a higher dose is consumed in the first week to saturate muscles, which typically lasts 5-7 days and then tapers to a regular 5g dose proceeding the loading phase. There‚Äôs been debate about whether or not that is effective, and given some people‚Äôs intolerance of higher dosing, it‚Äôs recommended to simply take 5g daily. It can take up to 4 weeks of daily creatine use for muscles to become fully saturated. Though there should still be benefit from periodic use, the studies seem to indicate benefit of a daily dose.

I don‚Äôt believe creatine to be a polarizing supplement but if you‚Äôve had positive or negative experiences please share. Additionally, if you would like to see more posts in R/Biohacking about a specific topic or supplement leave a comment and I‚Äôll do a deep dive.

She's on budesonide nebulized daily, oral Montelukast, and Albuterol as needed, has been daily since September and likely will be until March, until pollen smacks her in May. I also have her taking daily; 

1.) kids b complex with benfotiamine for b1, p5p, methylfolate and hydroxycobalamin

2.) 1g of both EPA and DHA

3.) Multi mineral w/ trace minerals

4.) A solid pre/probiotic regimen that's helped cut down on the frequency of attacks. All of it is in a smoothie for breakfast along with all sorts of fruits and greens.

5.) 500mg liposomal vitamin c 


We've been thinking about giving serrapeptase a shot for awhile, and after tonight we're gonna go ahead and do that. I looked into NAC since it's a good bronchial mucolytic, but apparently it's contraindicated in children with asthma, as it can cause brocnchiospasm. 


Aside from that though, I'm hoping someone has any other solid ideas. It would be very much appreciated. ",2025-01-08 04:06:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1hwb0ti/suggestions_for_severe_asthma_in_child/

1hqfope,Biohackers,Reverse effects of 2 months of smoking?,"Hello everyone, recently I went through a difficult phase in my life and sadly started smoking cigarettes for the first time. I had a couple days of taking breaks here and there but all in all was smoking up to 10 cigarettes a day. 
I feel like it changed the area around my eyes, in the eye bags area. My veins are much more visible there now, due to restricted blood flow I guess. I'm looking like I aged a decade. 
I regret picking up this bad habits a lot ans stopped a week ago.

Is it possible to somehow reverse these side effects? 
I take omega 3, reduced my coffee intake, doing more sports, drinking smoothies, all which helped my skin a lot but just around my eyes the darkening of the skin I don't find a solution for.

1gqwszv,Biohackers,"Have High Homocysteine, and I‚Äôm running HRT/TRT. Can‚Äôt take methylated B-vitamins or Folate to lower it because of complex situation. See explanation. Need help from biohackers.","Hey there. I really need some help.m

Have MTHFR gene and high homocysteine.

My story is complex and requires an open mind and people to believe me, so please bear with me.

I‚Äôm 23 years old, male, I live in Seattle, WA USA.

9 months ago, I took 2 pills (1 mg each) of finasteride for hair loss. I got hit with a long list of side effects. So many in the beginning it would take forever to list them all. 9 months later, I‚Äôm only left with the sexual side effects, so I technically have PFS. 

I have paid a biohacker to put me on a TRT/HRT protocol to fix my remaining side effects. And I should start that protocol somewhat soon. 

Anyways, I got multiple blood panels done this year and they showed high homocysteine. My mother has MTHFR, so I‚Äôm assuming I do as well.

My homocysteine on my blood panel was 21.3 umol/L. The reference range is 5-15.

On the forums for PFS/PSSD I have seen close to 25-30+ anecdotes claiming that people with PFS/PSSD improved over time, but they ‚Äúcrashed‚Äù (reverted back to how they were in the beginning of the side effects) because of taking high dose methylated b-complex or methyl folate. This of course has scared me, and I cannot afford to regress back to how I was by taking this risk.

However, I still need to find a way to get my homocysteine down, as I will be running androgen therapies for PFS, and high homocysteine will probably magnify negative implications that could come with this. Like inflammation, bad methylation, etc.

I want to find a way to make a DAILY SMOOTHIE or find some way to eat foods which will help with my homocysteine levels and balance my methylation levels from MTHFR.

As biohackers, I need your guys‚Äôs help and expertise. I‚Äôm not smart enough for this. 

If you guys could come up with a daily smoothie recipe for me to drink to help with this I‚Äôd really appreciate it. 

Also, I‚Äôd take any other advice you guys have in general about my problems.

Thank you for your consideration of me. ",2024-11-14 04:29:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1gqwszv/have_high_homocysteine_and_im_running_hrttrt_cant/

1m5bxkv,Supplements,10 Signs Your Gut Might Be in Trouble And What You Can Do About It!,"If you ever feel like something‚Äôs just¬†*o*ff with your body, like bloating, weird cravings, or being tired all the time, but you can't figure out why, it might be your gut.

Let's learn about 10 common signs your gut is struggling:

1. **Constant bloating and gas:**¬†It's not always about overeating! It could be how your gut handles carbs/fiber.
2. **Bathroom troubles:**¬†Diarrhea, constipation, or irregular bowel movements? Gut imbalance might be the culprit.
3. **Getting sick a lot:**¬†70% of your immune system lives in your gut. So, Weak gut = weak defenses.
4. **Craving sugar non-stop:**¬†Bad gut bugs love sugar and can¬†*influence*¬†your cravings.
5. **Always tired (even with sleep):**¬†Poor nutrient absorption drains your energy.
6. **Skin acting up:**¬†Acne, eczema, or rosacea can be linked to internal gut inflammation.
7. **Anxious or moody:**¬†The gut is often called the ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù because it produces¬†over¬†90%¬†of your serotonin, which is¬†your mood-stabilizing chemical.¬†
8. **Sleep issues:**¬†Trouble falling/staying asleep? A troubled gut can affect the production of¬†melatonin (a sleep-regulating hormone).
9. **Bad breath:**¬†Especially if brushing doesn‚Äôt help. It could be reflux or other gut issues.
10. **Food sensitivities out of nowhere:**¬†If old favorites now upset your stomach, your gut might be inflamed or unbalanced.

**So what can you do?**  
Begin making small changes in your lifestyle. These habits help most people:

1. **Eat more fiber:**¬†Fiber feeds your good gut bacteria. Add leafy greens to your meals, throw chia or flax seeds in smoothies, and eat dal or lentils a few times a week.
2. **Try a good probiotic**: Helps balance gut bacteria, especially after antibiotics or digestive issues. Choose one with diverse strains like¬†*Lactobacillus*¬†and¬†*Bifidobacterium*, or get probiotics naturally from plain yogurt, kefir, kimchi, or sauerkraut.
3. **Cut back on sugar & processed foods:**¬†Swap soda for lemon water, candy for dark chocolate (70%+), and chips for roasted chickpeas or makhana.
4. **Manage stress**: Practice deep breathing (like 4-4-4-4 box breathing), go for a short nature walk, or do 10 minutes of yoga/stretching at night.
5. **Prioritize good sleep:**¬†Your gut repairs while you sleep. Stick to a regular sleep schedule, unplug from screens an hour before bed, and try chamomile or lemon balm tea if you're restless.
6. **Stay hydrated**: Aim for 8‚Äì10 glasses of water per day; add cucumber, mint, or lemon if plain water feels boring.
7. **Move your body**: Even a 15-minute daily walk helps gut motility. Look into the Japanese practice of ‚Äúafter-meal walking‚Äù (a gentle 15-20 min stroll after dinner).
8. **Don‚Äôt overuse antibiotics:**¬†Take only when necessary, and always support your gut afterward with probiotics and fiber.
9. **Chew your food slowly**: It sounds simple, but it jumpstarts digestion and reduces bloating.
10. **Listen to your body**: If certain foods regularly make you tired, bloated, or foggy, consider keeping a food journal and getting tested for sensitivities.",2025-07-21 06:54:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1m5bxkv/10_signs_your_gut_might_be_in_trouble_and_what/

1lw6et5,Supplements,Why is adding fiber (chia and psyllium and dried fruit) wrecking my digestion???,"I've got guts that crush things down with the intensity of a collapsing star and the gastrically cosmic battle to pass my dark matter has only become more dire with age.

Obviously increasing water and a more gut-supportive diet are essential - I tend to run as parched as Arrakis if I'm not careful so watering the sacred palms must be done with 128oz of intention - and my diet now contains more fruit and vegetables, real not replicated - but in addition to taking those measures to normalize systems, I've added 1tbs of psyllium husk in 16oz of water at night and 2tbs of chia in a probiotic fruit protein smoothie chased with 32oz of black tea in the morning. 

All of this is done in pursuit of one perfect daily captain's log, but instead I am launching escape pods 3-4 times a day and they've got all the cohesion of the Maya Pei Brigade. Not to mention a newly eye-watering olfactory quality of a mismanaged nutrient recycler. In perhaps more generationally appropriate terms, it wasn't ever giving roses, but now it's serving construction porta-potty in mid-August. 

And the gas. The groaning inflation and obnoxious slow venting of a frothy trapped nebula that not even Janeway could be tempted to explore. Bloating is a familiar enemy, but adding fiber seems to have only made it worse. 

I don't need a transwarp conduit or a razorback racing rig - just a reliable, boring transport freighter. Thoughts on my guts or exhausted mixed metaphors are welcome.  ",2025-07-10 07:15:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1lw6et5/why_is_adding_fiber_chia_and_psyllium_and_dried/
1lvt4k2,Supplements,How to take iron when you cant swallow pills or stand the taste of liquid iron?,"I really need help. I had like 10 mg/dl of iron in May, and i did take 200mg of iron liquid (with blueberry flavor) for 3 weeks straight, then started stuggling with nausea of everything so i had to stop for like 2 weeks. And then i started taking em in smaller doses (100mg) but a week later i got rushed to the ER. It had gone down to 6.7 mg/dl even if i did take iron at all. It feels like a waste.

Now i have to go to the hospital in like 2 weeks, but got told to try taking iron meanwhile. The issue is that my body works in a way that makes it hate stuff i've been consuming for a long period of time. Its so annoying, now suddenly i cant stand the taste at all. I've tried mango juice (it covers a lot of the aftertaste but still), cola and ginger smoothies. Mango juice is the best, but i use wayyy too much time on drinking it now.

And my current stepmom has a ferro-rtard pill box that she wanted me to try. I cant. So we were thinking bout cutting em in 4 pieces, but we read the box and it said not to. Because it can cause nausea, but i dont understand how. The inside was also white. I really really need help, this is bad. I dont want to go to the hospital eighter, i hope it will get better so they maybe dont have to stuff iron in a syringe or transfer blood :l",2025-07-09 20:17:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1lvt4k2/how_to_take_iron_when_you_cant_swallow_pills_or/

1kwbl5p,Supplements,DNA Test Shows I Need 9x Normal Choline - Safe to Use Food-Grade Sunflower Lecithin?,"My Situation:

Got genetic testing that analysed my choline metabolism. Results show some significant variants that increase my choline requirements:

**Key Findings:**

* MTHFR C677T: homozygous (+/+)
* PEMT 5465G>A: homozygous (+/+)
* Combined effect: 78% decrease in methylfolate production
* Calculator recommends **9 egg yolk equivalents of choline daily** vs normal \~1-2

# My Supplement Plan - Looking for Input:

**Primary Source:** Food-grade ""Sunflower Lecithin Powder 250g Premium Quality, Vegan, Non-GMO, Gluten Free""

* Says it's a natural source of phospholipids and choline
* 1 tablespoon = \~1 egg yolk equivalent according to my results

**Proposed Protocol:**

* Start: 1-2 tablespoons sunflower lecithin daily (mixed in smoothies/food)
* Eat: 2-3 boiled eggs daily
* Gradually increase if well-tolerated and beneficial

**Current Stack:** Vitamin B complex, Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin D3+K2, Magnesium Bisglycinate, Melatonin (rare)

# Questions for the Community:

1. **Anyone used food-grade lecithin as a daily supplement?** Quality/safety compared to supplement-grade?
2. **High-dose lecithin experiences?** Looking for real-world feedback on 1-3+ tablespoons daily
3. **Stacking with my current supplements?** Any synergies or concerns with B-complex + high choline?
4. **MTHFR/PEMT folks?** Anyone with similar genetics found lecithin helpful for energy/methylation support?

# Why I'm Trying This:

Chronic fatigue despite normal blood work. Given my genetic methylation issues, thinking inadequate choline might be a factor. The food-grade lecithin seems like a cost-effective way to test this theory.

Through more research from my DNA results, I would do well with CDP choline aswell.

Otherwise, I cook sometimes (usually chicken with a LOT of seasonings, brown sugar, and I add knorrs chicken/beef flavor which I know has msg), or eat what my kids are havig, which can range from McDs to pho soup to frozen pizza.

1j8le6u,Supplements,Genuine feedback wanted on my stack,"Hi all,

I've been slack with my supplements and general health for the last few years after going through some trauma and am now trying to get back on top of things.

My plan is to create a blend of powder form supplements to add into a smoothie with banana & honey in the morning and evenings, for consistency and simplicity. Hopefully making it easier to stick with the regime opposed to my previous method of taking a bunch of pills (which I hate) and measuring out each ingredient every day.

I'm 32, male, 186cm tall, currently 100kg but on my way back down to 90kg, fairly muscular but also have a decent beer gut, work a high intensity stressful sales job 9-5, 5 days a week.

I usually go for a 2 hour hike or cycle on Tuesdays, and a 30 min hike/run followed by 2 hours of weights on Thursdays. On the weekends I'll either be doing gardening, renovations, hanging at the beach or national parks, or nothing physical at all, so 50/50 whether I'll be active on the weekends.

I have had lifelong issues with anxiety, depression, lethargy, insomnia, sleep apnoea. I'm an alcoholic & have a nicotine addiction (ex smoker, now vaper). Also I've been told by a psych I have ADHD, which I already knew, but I don't find it to be a problem, more of a super power.

I smoke a joint before bed to help with sleep, take 15mg Mirtazapine before bed, and have a CPAP machine which helps immensely (AHI of 45 now down to 1)

My average diet usually consists of a coffee for breakfast, large lunch usually consisting of a salad, chicken & pasta, and either skip dinner or have something light.

My goal is to just generally feel better, more energetic, less anxious, more focused throughout the day, and be able to relax and sleep better at night without relying on crutches like alcohol and THC.

Before you comment ""just stop drinking"" I KNOW, I know it will fix the majority of my issues, but as anyone here who has had a problem with alcohol you will know that it's not that simple. I still suffer from the anxiety, sleep problems and depression even when I'm clean for 6+ months, and that eventually leads me back down the rabbit hole. This daily supplement routine is designed to help me keep out of that damn hole.

Here's my current list, I'd love to hear some feedback, additions, changes, advice, experiences.

Morning:

Agmatine Sulphate 1000mg  
Creatine Monohydrate 5000mg  
L-Tyrosine 500mg  
L-Theanine 200mg  
Vitamin B6 (P-5-P) 100mg

Is there any vitamin or nutrient that I'm missing or I'm being deficient in my routine? Of course I'm not counting foods here, but I'm listing what I consume daily. What would you recommend? Take anything away or add anything?

1ir7kvl,Supplements,A few questions regarding Milk Thistle.,"I (37M) recently had my bloodwork done and my AST and ALT levels were high. My doctor wants me to report back in 3 months, and the nurse recommended I try milk thistle. She says it could possibly help bring those levels back to normal and help my liver in general. 

I‚Äôve been doing a bit of research, also coming across some reddit posts, and my biggest questions are what‚Äôs the best way to take it and how frequently?

I saw one user say that if you‚Äôre taking meds it could possibly interfere. I‚Äôm currently only taking Atenolol which I understand is processed mostly through the kidneys. I saw another user in a different thread recommend not taking it daily or for long periods of time, so I‚Äôm just looking for a bit of clarity. 

I see on Amazon they have capsules, but I understand there‚Äôs also a powder that I could possibly add to my smoothies? For what it‚Äôs worth the only other supplement I‚Äôm taking is the Bulletproof Zinc + Copper.

I also bought a bunch of turmeric root and yesterday I used about 2 roots which was like 40g and made a smoothie with some pepper corns and olive oil in almond milk. It was delicious and i want to have it every night.

Has anyone had benefits from eating it that way too? Or any reason I should be weary of eating actual turmeric root fresh every day?

I am using Ozempic and have dropped from 160kg to 138kg in 14 weeks but some days struggle to get my protein in and am lookling for recommendations for protein powders. I start strength training next week so thats something to consider but its really more about just getting my protein intake.

I'm taking 30g of collagen peptides everyday and it's done great things for my skin but I get the impression it should not be counted towards protein intake, even though I makes sure to include foods with plenty of l-tryptophan in the smoothie I have it in each day.

So any suggestions welcome. I'll be mixing into a smoothie so taste is not a huge factor for me.

It looks like Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard gets pretty great views but its a little bit exxy for me. WIll go that way if I need to but something similar and a little less pricy would be good.

I have been doing gym for last three years, with a big long gap in between due to personal reasons. I am now getting back to the gym after the break. Now, I regularly go to the gym and keep a healthy and active lifestyle. I am interested in building decent muscle (not aiming for huge pumps already), fit looking body, and keeping a straight posture. 

In my previous stint, I have not taken any supplements besides consumption of whey protein in smoothies, though not regularly or with a regime. I am now thinking to start taking supplements to aid muscle building and keeping up the energy during the workout session. For that purpose, I have been able to come up with a stack comprised of different supplements. I need any suggestions and advice on the composition, and insights if there will be any interactions between these components. The stack that I am aiming to start with has: Allmax ALLMASS (Post workout), Allmax ALLPRO WHEY (Postworkout), Grindstone Blend Rice Cereal (Pre-Workout), Purely Inspired Collagen Peptides, and Biosteel Hydration Mix. I will keep the use of AllMass and Whey Protein regular, and the use of pre-workout material not that regular because of lifestyle factors. 

Does this stack look good, lets say for a beginner, who is getting back to active and disciplined workout routine again?

I came back slim, lost 5 lbs and felt great, but tired..I didn't have access to clean water all the time, so probably drank less if it makes a difference.

28 yo female, 120 lbs, 5""7. 
Stay at home mom (don't move much during the day, but to stretch a few times a day ).  I run 6miles twice a week, swim 30 mins twice a week, practice ashtanga yoga once a week, Pilates once a week. 

Diet:
Morning:
Chocolate smoothie (raw cacao powder, 1 cup almond milk, 1 banana, chia seeds, cacao nibs and walnuts). I gives me a whole lot of energy and u just can't leave without cacao.

Lunch: 
Pretty much it's a big bowl of salad (3 cups of greens, leek, carrot, quinoa/brown rice, lentils, other vegetables). Sometimes I have veg stew or soup.

Dinner.
Normally some bites. I rare feel hunger in the evening. 

Staying home with the child makes it harder to eat small meals every few hours or cook. I have lunch when he is asleep most if the time.

I have been making a smoothie in the morning for the past couple weeks, and my girlfriend insists that it is not good for me. I want to know what you all think. So, here is what goes into my smoothie:

* Half of a large banana = 60 calories
* About 10 almonds = 70 calories
* 1 tbsp of nonfat Greek yogurt = 20 calories
* 4 Brussels sprouts = 35 calories
* 1 cup of spinach = 10 calories
* About 7 berries (cherries or raspberries) = 30 calories
* 1.5 cups of medium pulp orange juice = 160 calories

In total, this comes to about 385 calories. My girlfriend claims that the orange juice is too much, and spikes my blood sugar. She also said that this is a very high calorie smoothie, and that I should be probably cut it in half. I am not so sure. To me this seems like a very healthy smoothie. Lots of greens, and fat free. 

I wanted to ask /r/health though, since you guys know more about this stuff than me. What do you think? Is this a healthy smoothie, or is it too much? Also keep in mind that this smoothie IS my breakfast. I am not drinking this in addition to an actual meal.

It was a super thin hollow circle at about 0.6cm in diameter.

What's going on?  Any clues?  I don't feel massive pain so obviously I didn't wreck my liver or gall bladder or anything.

I had somehow ended up on the floor. She asks if I'm alright now and tries to help me to the bathroom. I say yeah, and start to make my way there, when it happens again. I end up on the floor in the hallway, just completely out of it, burning up and sweating pretty bad. Once again, I snap out of it pretty quickly, go sit on the toilet, and calm myself down. After that, I was good. My friend got a ride home and I went to bed. My head really hurt the rest of the night. My friend mentioned that I hit my head when I fell in the hallway. She also told me that (at some point) it looked like I had started to have a seizure.

I can't really describe what it was like... It felt like I just got lost in my own thoughts... Or like I was dozing in and out of a really deep sleep with a really intense dream... I'll provide any more information you want. Thanks for the help.

Extra random information:

- Earlier that day, I had been sitting in all sorts of weird positions because I was writing on a bed. My back felt like it was out of place or just felt weird.

- I seem to have a hard time regulating my body temperature, so it could have been I just overheated?

- I feel perfectly normal now... My friend said I was shaking ""a fair amount""... When I came out of it, she seemed relatively freaked out, I felt as though nothing had happened...

- I have an anxiety disorder. Could possibly have been an anxiety attack? My mind had been racing all day and I had been getting increasingly paranoid for some reason.",2012-08-01 15:32:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/xiclm/did_i_have_a_seizure_last_night/
un198,Health,I cycled my way back to good health - here's the proof,"I've been suffering from a Rheumatoid Arthritis-like condition called Mixed Connective Tissue disease for almost 15 years.  The medications I was taking helped me make it through the day but came with aweful side effects.  

Last July I participated in Bike for Breathe at my wife's insistence.  I tried everything I could to get out of it because I was worried about how my joints would be affected by such a long ride(particularly my wrists!).  Somehow I completed the 18 mile journey, but I was thoroughly exhausted when I got home.  As I lay down for a nap, I noticed two things: 1) it felt GREAT to feel soooo tired, and 2) I was not experiencing the pain I was so dreading.  In fact I proceeded to have the best nap of my life.

When I woke up, I decided that I wanted to feel like that again.  I decided to start cycling on a regular basis.  I didn't have a specific goal other than maybe shedding a few pounds.  I started with a simple 3-5 mile route.  Although I initially did not change my diet, I noticed my waist gradually shrinking (my weight was initially 215 lbs).

Eventually I became invested in my weight loss and wondered what else I could do to lose even more.  I paid closer attention to what I was eating.  For example I started making kale smoothies for breakfast and cut down on my intake of sweets.  Of course I'm not perfect, so I would still indulge in the occasional hamburger and fries (and still do...).  Most importantly, as time went on I dabbled with reducing my intake of anti inflammatories and pain meds.  After a few false starts, I found that I was able to get by with less and less medication.

Last week I went in for a yearly physical exam.  My doctor ordered a complete set of blood tests to gauge the level of inflammation in my body.  When the results came in, he called with the best news I could have ever hoped for: he gave me a clean bill of health. All my tests for inflamation can in at the normal range!!!  I've posted a pic of one of these: C-Reactive Protein.  http://imgur.com/2Pcvk

The thrill of this moment was made even better by knowing I had not taken an anti-inflammatory in more than two months.  I took pride in knowing these results were the direct outcome of my exercise and diet changes.

It has been 11 months since I started cycling and have increased my route to cover 30 miles.  I have lost more than 30 pounds and no longer need to take any prescription medication.  After so many years of feeling desperate, weak, and hopeless, I now feel stronger than ever, more confident, and am loving life.  

This has been an incredible journey for me and I wanted to share it with the Reddit community.",2012-06-06 00:27:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/un198/i_cycled_my_way_back_to_good_health_heres_the/

mxcrb,Health,"I'd like to hear your perspective on fish oil, please! (x-post from /AdvancedFitness, /keto, /Supplement, /nutrition)","I'm sorry for x-posting between 5 subreddits, but I feel that my question is specific and requires a specific answer. The more kaleidoscopic the perspective, the better; thanks Bruce Lee.

I exercise very rigorously: running to and fro class 3 miles per day with Vibram Five Fingers, practicing martial arts 7x per week (about 2 hours each day) and lifting (normally a CrossFit WOD) 3-4x per week. I haven't started swimming 500 meters 7x per week yet as a part of my regimen, but let's pretend I have hypothetically.

I'm not a vegetarian, but rather a pescatarian (or is it pescetarian? I always see both and have never been able to figure it out), meaning I make exceptions for fish. I eat fish, namely tuna or salmon in the form of organic canned fish, about once or twice a week. I also take NutraOrigin brand fish oil supplements 4x per day (morning, afternoon, with dinner, before bed). That's a total of 4,000mg fish oil and 2,400mg of omega-3's.

Nuts (cashews, walnuts), omega-3 organic eggs now and then, raw chia seeds, flax, hemp, and occasionally frozen acai puree are all staples of my ""diet"" (I hate that word). I eat about 2-3 servings of nuts per day (also almonds, Brazil nuts, pecans, peanuts). The raw chia seeds, flax, hemp, and acai are either eaten by the tablespoonful, or added to plant-based protein smoothies every other day, so I'm getting plenty of omegas there as well, I'm well aware.

Given my ""diet"" and highly active regimen, how do you feel about me taking fish oil 4x per day?

I also intermittently fast on a small scale (""Warrior Diet""-esque), so I don't eat breakfast and nothing up until around noon, which is when I eat half a day's worth of fruit and vegetables, and a few hours later I'll eat some more fruit and some nuts, or a protein shake, depending if I worked out earlier in the day or not. I'll then eat a huge salad along with the rest of the vegetables for the day at about 6pm, and an hour later, I'll have my main meal. My calorie counts for the day vary anywhere from scat to the brink of 2,000, averaging at about 1,500.

Would you recommend I completely drop the fish oil supplements and eat actual fish one or two more times per week (3-4 times)?

If not, which ""organic"" fish oil supplements do you find the most trust-worthy? I've read that the coasts off of New Zealand offer some of the cleanest and lesser polluted waters, and thus the best fish oil comes from there(?)

Thanks!",2011-12-02 09:03:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/mxcrb/id_like_to_hear_your_perspective_on_fish_oil/

k7ybd,Health,Common Health Food Confusion - Explained by a health food store employee of 5 years,"Hello all.  I had offered to do a ‚ÄúHealth Food Q&A‚Äù on another subreddit (r/90daysgoal) some time ago and took questions in regards to health food myths and realities and diet/nutrition.  I do not claim to be a nutritionist or dietitian or anything official at all; what I share below are strictly things I have learned firsthand from working at a health food store for 5 years.  The topic is fascinating to me so please feel free to ask more questions which I will answer the best I can, or correct me on things I could be wrong on.  Below I will quote Michael Pollan‚Äôs book *‚ÄúIn Defense of Food‚Äù* which I recently read and think everyone should read along with *‚ÄúThe Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma‚Äù* - they will change your life and how you look at food for the better.  And yes, I'm going to cross-post this crap out of this after typing this all up.

General Info:

**Yogurt:**  Yogurt is good for you if done right.  Personally I prefer nonfat plain organic yogurt with as few ingredients as possible (usually milk and probiotics or some variation on that) and then add things to it like granola, honey, cinnamon, fruit, etc.  I do this because at some point in the past someone had told me that any sugar added to yogurt kills the beneficial bacteria, but now I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs true.  Brands don‚Äôt matter so much as the ingredients ‚Äì is there corn syrup, artificial flavors or colors, etc?  Even flavored organic yogurt contains added sugars and it skyrockets the calorie count ‚Äì you‚Äôre better off adding fresh fruit or other stuff of your choice.  Styles (Greek, European, etc) are a matter of personal preference.  And Activia did great marketing but there‚Äôs nothing special about it and they had a lawsuit filed against them.

**Alternative Milks:**  If you‚Äôre lactose intolerant or vegan or just curious there‚Äôs a ton of different ‚Äòmilks‚Äô out there to try.  Oat, hazelnut, rice, soy, multigrain, hemp, coconut, and I‚Äôm sure others I‚Äôm not thinking of are available.  Personally I prefer the taste of rice or oat milk but I noticed the ingredients of all these are going to have added oils along with possibly sweeteners, flavors, or other stuff, and the calorie count may be higher than that of good ol‚Äô tried-and-true cow milk.  I say try it out and if you like it or it agrees with you, go for it, but aside from allergies I have yet to see a reason why it trumps cow or goat milk entirely from a nutritional standpoint.

**Chia/Flax Seeds:** Flax claims to be high in omegas, chia in fiber and other goodies - People swear by these things but personally I don‚Äôt ever ‚Äòfeel‚Äô any better with our without them.  They both have a pleasant subtle flavor and get stuck in your teeth so some people get flax or chia meal/powder or flax oil.  You can eat them with all kinds of stuff‚Ä¶ the powder can be added to smoothies, the seeds can be sprinkled on baked goods, oatmeal, bagels, yogurt, all sorts of stuff.  Just get creative and try it out.  Chia will be more expensive than flax these days because it‚Äôs newer on the market.  These almost kind of overlap with the next section, raw/super foods.

**Raw/Fancy Superfoods and Marketing:**  Goji and acai berries, raw anything, maca this and cacao that and mesquite powder and frankly, wtf?  Don‚Äôt be fooled into this stuff.  If food has to tell you how good it is for you, it must be insecure.  Acai berries claim to be multitudes higher in antioxidants than blueberries ‚Äì aside from the fact that antioxidants are still very scrutinized as even being a true source of healthfulness, the blueberry was tested by the USDA as all fruits are in its fresh raw form for antioxidant content, while the acai berry was tested by an independent lab in a concentrated form so of course it‚Äôs going to look like it has a higher antioxidant content.  Furthermore, the surf bums who brought the acai berry to market in the US from Brazil have exploited it so much that the locals in Brazil can‚Äôt even afford it anymore.  It really doesn‚Äôt even taste that good to me.  Fresh apples, celery, lettuce, and bell peppers sit on the shelf with no unnecessary claims or reminders that they‚Äôre healthy.  These products are generally a mish-mash of sundried or low-heat treated nuts, seeds, berries, and powders or herbs that are fancily packaged with all sorts of miracle claims to get you to spend $8 on a 2oz chocolate bar.  I‚Äôm not saying these products are bad for you or unhealthy ‚Äì they‚Äôre definitely better than some potato chips or soda ‚Äì but there is no such thing as a miracle food, *period.*  Don‚Äôt waste your money on this stuff, it usually doesn‚Äôt even taste that good.

**Rice:** There are many types of rice out there (there used to be thousands of varieties in the wild) and I‚Äôm definitely no expert on that.  But just like whole wheat vs. white flour I‚Äôm a fan of the brown rice or whole wheat because the germ of the grain is left intact (so it goes rancid faster) and there‚Äôs no bleaching of the grain.  As for wild, red, bamboo-infused, basmati, jasmine, sushi, etc kinds of rice ‚Ä¶ I think they all have a culinary place but I have no idea about the nutrition content.   I think wild rice tastes great though!

**Soy Protein and Problems with Soy:**  My understanding is that when large monocrop farmers intermittently plant soy to fix nitrogen in the soil they‚Äôre left with this huge soy crop and don‚Äôt know what to do with it so now it‚Äôs being shoved down our throats in all these different forms or soy protein powder or bars or drinks, soy milk, soy nuts, soy cakes (like rice cakes), etc‚Ä¶  that aren‚Äôt necessarily the best thing for us.  Personally I try not to eat too much soy, I‚Äôll eat tofu occasionally but I mostly prefer vegetables if I‚Äôm going to skip out on meat briefly.  Michael Pollan (in *In Defense of Food*) says, ‚ÄúThe ancient Asian practice of fermenting soybeans and eating soy in the form of curds called tofu makes a healthy diet from a plant that eaten almost any other way would make people ill.  The soybean itself is a notably inauspicious staple food; it contains a whole assortment of ‚Äòantinutrients‚Äô ‚Äì compounds that actually block the body‚Äôs absorption of vitamins and minerals, interfere with the hormonal system, and prevent the body from breaking down the proteins in soy itself.‚Äù

**Couscous; The Food So Nice They Named it Twice**  There are all types of tasty grains out there besides rice that are worth giving a try because they‚Äôre whole, good, simple foods that are good for you.  They all need to be cooked slightly different but all have their own great flavors and are great side dishes.  There's quinoa (keen-wah) in black and red as well as the traditional pale tan color, millet, lentils, and more. Try them as a substitute for rice.

More Specific and Health-Related Tips:

**The Best Diet Soda I‚Äôve Found:**  Look for Zevia brand soda made with Stevia sweetener (all-natural).  Stevia is known for sometimes having a gross aftertaste, but Zevia sodas actually taste great!  Also good are R.W. Knudsen Sparkling Essence drinks which are flavored bubble water but calorie-free and in great flavors like Coconut.

**The Best Meal Replacers I‚Äôve Found:**  Protein/meal replacement bars don‚Äôt have to be nasty.  My favorites include Clif bars (but the Luna bars gross me out), ThinkThin bars (lots of great flavors and very filling), and PureFit bars (also very filling and tasty).  Finally, the Orgain meal replacement drinks are downright delicious (only chocolate and vanilla flavors right now).

**Nature‚Äôs Gatorade:  Coconut Water.**  Coconut water gets a lot of flack because ‚ÄúIt makes you poop right?‚Äù ‚Äì wrong.  I love coconut water after I exercise and it never makes me shit.  Perhaps if you have never drunk coconut water in your life and you chug a gallon, yeah, it is a mild laxative, so watch out.  But if your system is used to it, you‚Äôll be okay, I promise.  It is extremely hydrating, contains all the electrolytes you lose in exercise, and was even used as IV fluid for soliders in Vietnam.  The coconut really is that awesome, so enjoy it, and cut out all the added colors, flavors, and sweeteners you find in Gatorade (if you must, R.W. Knudsen makes an all-natural alternative with grape juice and salt called Recharge).

**Low-Cal Treats:**  All the sweets marketed for dieters in the supermarket are full of scary ingredients.  I saw an ad for Skinny Cow stuff and was excited for about two seconds before seeing the ingredient list ‚Äì yikes!  I‚Äôm not saying any one of these ingredients may so bad in and of itself ‚Äì but a list of ingredients a mile long, full of things I can‚Äôt pronounce, is a marker of a product that is processed beyond recognition.  I would rather have a tiny serving of ice cream made with cream and sugar or a couple small squares of a rich real chocolate bar.

**Delicious Low-Cal Snack:** Sea‚Äôs Gift or Annie Chun‚Äôs seaweed snacks are addicting.

**Sugar-free Chocolate:**  Dolphin chocolates taste great and are sweetened with barley malt.

**Filling Foods that are Healthy:**  Try to make it through one big bowl of oatmeal and not feel absolutely stuffed.  Oatmeal is great, I put everything in it ‚Äì fresh or dried fruits, nuts, seeds, spices, etc.  Beans and rice can be filling, or a nice big artichoke or eggplant, or almond butter on apples or celery, hummus and some veggies, etc‚Ä¶ really instead of viewing ‚Äòhealth food‚Äô as this separate world, try to convert a favorite meal into something more healthy.  Like steak and potatoes?  Try to find a local butcher (I go straight to the source and local grass-fed beef is way cheaper than the factory farm corn-fed stuff on the grocery store shelf) and fill up your freezer with it.  And try some gourmet red or Yukon gold potatoes with it instead of russets.  The flavor is so much better, and maybe if you take the time to prepare a delicious meal and savor it you‚Äôll end up eating less of it.",2011-09-07 20:06:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/k7ybd/common_health_food_confusion_explained_by_a/
j11j1,Health,"Reddit, I have back pain that seems to be linked to my diet. Any ideas?","For at least six years, I have been getting lower back pain roughly in the area of my kidneys. Sometimes it's a dull ache, sometimes it's debilitating, but it's always located around my kidneys, although sometimes it's hard to locate and can cause pressure in my bowel or on my testicles.

I started keeping track of it, and based on what I've noted down it appears to be linked to drinking some form of drink when I have an empty stomach. I've had it happen to me to varying degrees with cola, with various different types of concentrate or non-concentrate fruit juice and smoothies, with cider and beer. Given that it doesn't happen with milk or water (or, at least, hasn't yet - I don't drink much of either) I've guessed that it's the sugar or acid content of these drinks that's doing it, but that's really a guess. The thing is, I can drink any of the drinks that give me this problem if I've eaten recently - not necessarily just after the first meal of the day, but I can drink as much of these drinks as I like as long as I've eaten beforehand. There's a definite link between the contents of my stomach and whether or not I feel the pain. Overwhelmingly I get this pain either when drinking something with the first meal of the day or before it.

I have a history of Type-II diabetes in my family (my father and my maternal grandmother) and my father died of kidney failure, so given that there seemed to be a sugar and kidney link I went to the doctor on these grounds. I had a (non-fasting) blood test which showed nothing out of the ordinary except high cholesterol (that despite it not being a fasting test, I'm still working to reduce), and an ultrasound on my kidneys that also showed no apparent issues.

I'm aware that one possible solution is simply to ensure that I don't drink anything that might trigger it before I've had a meal, or to just ensure that I eat a decent breakfast every day, but I feel like while that'll solve the immediate issue I'm also very curious as to why this might happen and if it might indicate a wider health issue. Does anyone have any experience with this or could steer me to something that might help me figure out what's going on? If I've missed something vital I'll edit it in or if you need more info please ask.",2011-07-27 10:27:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/j11j1/reddit_i_have_back_pain_that_seems_to_be_linked/

Foods i can't eat (intolerance/allergies or just make me sick): Indian food, like curry and butter chicken (unfortunate since it looks delicious), tomatoes, salmon, pickles, sushi, coconut, eggs (on their own, if they're mixed with stuff its fine)

Foods i want to eat: more fruits and veggies, rice (this is a big one I want to be able to eat since its a great base for a lot of meals), stir frys, and salad (this comes with the veggies and fruits). also any new ways to serve foods i already eat would be appreciated",2023-06-03 06:18:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/13z367t/help_with_eating_healthy/

# What is jetty punch tropical smoothie:

Tropical¬†Smoothie Caf√© is a¬†network¬†of¬†fast-casual¬†beaneries¬†that specialized on¬†serving¬†smoothies and¬†other¬†menu¬†particulars. Jetty Punch is one of the¬†flavors¬†of their¬†tropical¬†smoothies.¬†Tropical¬†fruits¬†including¬†orange, mango, and pineapple are¬†combined¬†in the Jetty Punch smoothie to¬†produce¬†a¬†succulent¬†and¬†amping¬†drink.

The Tropical Smoothie Jetty Punch is a fruity,¬†succulent¬†smoothie¬†made¬†with bananas, strawberries, Greek vanilla yogurt, agave¬†saccharinity, and cashew milk.

For¬†quick,¬†stimulating¬†potables¬†during¬†events¬†or¬†other¬†times, it works¬†great. When you¬†apply¬†this¬†form¬†for Tropical Smoothie Jetty Punch, you can¬†be¬†certain¬†to¬†have¬†a¬†succulent¬†smoothie that will¬†round¬†any¬†occasion.

  

## How to store jetty punch tropical smoothie:

1. Refrigerate: If you‚Äôre not going to drink your tropical smoothie immediately, you should refrigerate it as soon as possible. Store the smoothie in an airtight container and place it in the fridge for up to 24 hours. This will help to keep the smoothie fresh and prevent it from spoiling.
2. Freeze: If you want to store your tropical smoothie for a longer period of time, you can freeze it. Pour the smoothie into an airtight container, leaving some space at the top for expansion. You can store the smoothie in the freezer for up to 3 months. When you‚Äôre ready to drink it, let it thaw in the fridge overnight.
3. Separate ingredients: If you want to store the ingredients separately, you can do so by placing them in individual containers. For example, you can store the frozen fruit in one container and the liquid (such as coconut milk or orange juice) in another container. When you‚Äôre ready to make the smoothie, simply blend the ingredients together.
4. Keep it cool: If you‚Äôre taking your tropical smoothie on the go, it‚Äôs important to keep it cool. Use an insulated container or add ice to keep the smoothie at a cool temperature. This will help to prevent it from spoiling and keep it fresh and tasty.

UK guy here. Semi recently I've been trying to get my 5 a day to see if it helps with my weight loss coupled with a smaller amount of food/calorie, fat and sugar restriction as well as exercise,and so far its been going pretty well, I've gotten 5 most of the time, with occasional 4s and 3s. Working in a hospital the best place to get something for lunch is M&S but I'm completely dumbfounded as to how they categorise how many of your 5 a day some of these are. For instance:
Tropical Fruit Salad-2 of your 5 a day. 300g. Melon, Kiwi, Dragonfruit, Mango and Pineapple.
Classic Fruit Salad-1 of your 5 a day. 350g. Orange, Stawberries, Apple, Melon and Grapes.
Mango, Pineapple and Melon. 1 of your 5 a day. 300g. 100g of each fruit.
Berry Medley-1 of your 5 a day. 250g. Strawberries, Grapes, Blueberries and Raspberries. 
Mango, Stawberries, Raspberries, Blueberries. 1 of your 5 a day. Mostly Mango and Strawberries.
The juices and smoothies are numerous but all are 1 of 5 a day despite some having 5 or more different fruit and veg.
Now, I know a serving of 1 of your 5 a day can be a bit murky, but how come fairly substantial fruit salads with 5 different types of fruit in them can only count for 1, in only one case 2? And even in the 2, which is the tropical salad, why is that 2 as opposed to the others? It just confuses me.

This isn't even a huge issue on my days off because I can just wait those 4-6 hours to eat at all, but on my work days I do need to eat before I leave the house. My go-to breakfast is usually a smoothie with Greek yogurt and either fruit or vegetables, but I can't do that with my meds. 

Ideally, I would like to still have something pretty high in protein because I only get 1 meal break per 12 hour shift at work. So far I've managed to figure out that I can't have yogurt, eggs, milk, or non-dairy milk (they're all fortified with calcium) or any of the protein powders I keep on hand. I'm also sort of loosely vegetarian, but if I have no other options I'll eat a very small bit of meat on my work days.

For today I'm doing morning star veggie breakfast sausage which is... Okay, but not ideal. I'd like to find something less processed than that.",2021-08-12 13:52:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/p309tz/breakfast_ideas_with_little_or_no_calcium_vitamin/

nnzvse,healthyeating,Advice on Improving my Meals?,"Apologies for the formatting in advance, I'm on mobile.

I've been trying to eat healthier lately and I've actually managed to lose about 20 pounds the last few months and I'm looking for areas to improve.  I generally go for an hour long walk/jog after work each day and try stay relatively active on weekends, but I know I could improve there.

My breakfasts and lunches during the week are 99% the same, and lunches on weekends usually consist of leftovers from dinner, but here's how it all breaks down:

Breakfast:
-16oz Hazelnut Coldbrew Coffee with a scoop of generic brand whey protein and a teaspoon of half and half
-A Kale Smoothie consisting of 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 2 Tbsp Flax Seed, 1 Medjool Date, several small slices of ginger root, 1/3 cup mixed berries (raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, and blueberry), and 1/2 cup of Kale greens, with water, obviously
-Either two small egg bites which are homemade (consisting of 1 Tbsp cheddar cheese and 1 Tbsp cottage cheese, along with one slice of bacon wrapped around the egg Bite) OR a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich on a White mini Bagel (consisting of mostly the same ingredients minus the cottage cheese

Lunch:
-2 cups pasta with homemade marinara sauce (sauce is made from a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, one medium white onion, and 1 cup of mixed Italian cheese blend)
-2 cups Kale Salad (about one cup of Kale with a pinch of sea salt and lemon juice to break down the greens, 1 Tbsp Sunflower seeds, 1 Tbsp dried cranberries, and 1/2 Tbsp Greek Salad Dressing)
-One Generic Brand Fruit Yogurt (usually strawberry or blueberry)
-One Cracker Barrell Cheddar Cheese Stick
-One Nature Valley Granola Bar (usually the chocolate peanut kind)
-One MacIntosh Apple OR two clementines
-4 homemade minimuffins 

Throughout the day, I refill a 24 oz water bottle that usually has a dash of lime juice in it for flavor, but is obviously just plain water when I refill it (generally 4 times a day).

Dinner varies, but usually is a meat with a side of veggies and some carbs.  Last night was half a skirt steak with a decent helping of roasted Roma tomatoes and pablano peppers and a scoop of grits, tonight was a quarter of a flank steak with roasted broccoli and fingerling potatoes.

g9oy42,healthyeating,Downsides of snacking (too much) on almonds and pistachios ?,"Hello everyone !

So... a couple months ago, I finally started to take care of my body a little bit more.

Completely stopped smoking and started exercising again (running for cardio and push-ups, abs for muscle mass). At 29 yo and starting to have a 30's crisis, it was damn time.

One issue remaining, my alimentation... I'm French and as a typical French, I'm addicted to cheese. Good ol' *tartines de fromage* are life, that and some fine-ass smoothies, that was (and kinda still is) the basis of my snacks.

But now, I'm really trying to stop to have the healthiest lifestyle possible. Ideally, one should totally stop snacking between meals, I know, but things seldom go ideally. And better swapping unhealthy snacks with healthier ones rather than going from all to nothing.

I've decided to go for nuts, mainly almonds and pistachios after my work-out and jogging routines. Still, I'm not the kind of guy that easily manages to do things halfway and I eat a lot of them.

From all I know, they are among the healthiest things to snack on, but as with everything else in life, there's probably a ""too much"" limit to them.

So... keeping in mind I eat much less at my regular meals (and try to have them as healthy and vegetably/fibery as possible), what are the main downsides of snacking too much on nuts between meals ?

1lc87bs,keto,I‚Äôve successfully entered ketosis. Was 200lbs now 150 (5‚Äô9‚Äù 34 male),"
When I hit 33 years old, I had a bad stunt with junk food and experienced rapid weight gain from 130 pounds to 200 pounds probably within about five or six months. 

Part of this was due to depression from unemployment and living on stimulus money, we all have our excuses, but that is my trek into being overweight or nearing obesity.


About four months ago, I started doing some moderate exercise and doing some diet changes by cutting out any white bread and sugary drinks. Part of this is due to some symptoms I was having with my bladder, and I was trying to figure out what was causing this. 


I also decided to try the factor meal service and order many options that were high in protein, low in carbohydrates and high in saturated fat.  I‚Äôve started ramping up my walks from 4 miles a day  to 5 miles a day to 6 miles a day. I average two hours of intense to moderate exercise per day.

I‚Äôm mixing that with one factor meal and maybe some chicken in the morning or an egg or two or a smoothie. 

My energy levels are the highest that they have ever been, and I can tell that my bladder issues have been alleviated by losing the weight in my abdomen area, although my doctor is somewhat concerned because I experienced rapid weight loss within months. 

When I had a urinalysis done, it showed that my ketones were above 80 md/dl, but my glucose and blood sugar levels were normal and showed no signs of diabetes or pre-diabetes. I also had a test a year ago showing that I had no diabetes.

But my AST and ALT dropped by almost 15. I went from 49 AST to 31, which I am positive is due to these positive health and lifestyle changes I‚Äôve made.

My liver is better functioning that it was in my 20s for reference. 

I think ketosis is beneficial to the body and moderate exercise mixed with a high protein Diet is a great recipe for better health and weight loss.

The weightloss has already been incredible (3kg so far!) but it‚Äôs the other stuff that‚Äôs been life changing for me.

I'm currently not doing keto, so just being honest.  But I am low carb. 

With both I must be on a low fodmap, no seed oils or pro inflammatory foods, low to no phytoestrogenic foods. All are major issues based on diagnosed health issues.

Must haves, fermented foods,  red abd organ meat, etc. Also based on health history. Oh and try keeping higher iodine levels and higher potassium in my diet as well. Low sodium to avoid the laxative affects, no magnesium supplements and plenty of dairy for sane reasons. 

Balancing keto with my specific restrictions was hard, low carb not as bad but still difficult. 

Now, I do a wide variety of foods. Thus includes foods typically not low carb friendly in moderation or with alterations.

For example making potato cakes with actual potato or sweet potato but using very little and making them savory or sugar free for sweet.  

Now, sad diet really is a fan of 2 things that if made the standard way are high as hell in carbs. They also typically have high fodmap  foods as a major component. 


These are green smoothies and green juices. Both tend to use leafy greens and or spinach, typically raw. That's very high fodmap. 

Added in typically are not only loads of high carb fruits, but also things like honey which is high sugar.

Now, with green smoothies you can maje them with tye typical ingredients but add things like kombucha, water keifer, acv, or gingerbug to ferment for anywhere from a few days to a week or two. That makes it low carb or keto friendly. 

You could also first ferment with whey from yogurt, then later add to yogurt with things like alvacado for a yogurt based smoothie. Yogurt based fruit smoothies are one of my fave things I have in my meal rotation, especially in summer. Sometimes I add alvacado, and or protien powder. But that's how to make the smoothies both keto or low carb friendly abd ibs friendly/low fodmap.

Now green juice, well just ferment with any of the above cultures. 

Also,  on the non yogurt options, pro tip is also you can dilute in cold water or tea abd sip all day like lemon or acv water.

Just thought I'd add this tip if anybody truly likes having those in rotation but hadn't behind carbs or digestive issues. ",2025-05-16 18:08:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ko7nm0/how_to_add_green_juice_or_green_smoothies_to_keto/

Specifically anywhere from 2-2.75 oz almond or cashew butter *topped*, yes topped, with an additional 1oz pecans or pumpkin seeds‚Äî and a 16oz black coffee to drink. This is anywhere from 600-800cal easily.

It‚Äôs so bizarre. I have been eating this every morning for months‚Äî it keeps me full and energized from around 9:30am-6pm. 

As mentioned before, I am maintaining. I think this obsession came out of the initial weight loss and craving fats‚Ä¶ I just came to love it and have always loved nut butters.
However, now I realize I need to break this habit because there are some days where I get less movement and I wish I had a lower calorie but still satiating easy breakfast alternative. I don‚Äôt like that this is now engrained in my routine.
Any advice or others who commiserate? 

I‚Äôve considered smoothies but I‚Äôm clean keto, so no artificial sweeteners.

Thank you in advance.

Something feels off about those numbers? I'm a newbie to keto but I thought the sugar factored into the carb count, like if there's 10g sugar there should be at least 10g carbs? (It's relatively small, but it has sweet ingredients like bananas and milk.)

1ikt8rd,keto,"8 months in, getting sick often for last 3, am I missing micronutrients?","First off, my calories are exactly maintenance, I haven't gained or lost weight though my bf% is now less than before, around 10%.

My diet is as follows:  
chicken (heavy cream, boullion, spices) daily  
eggs in butter daily  
smoothie: whey protein, cocoa powder, cinnamon, coconut oil, milk daily  
chicken liver - around 4 times a week  
broccoli - around 5 times a week  
200ish g of sardines once a week  
less standardized: occasional salads depending on season, cheeses, sometimes ground beef, cured meats

supplementation: vit c,d,k, psillium, creatine, magnesium citrate  
of note is that I eat around 50 to 100 g of mayo per day (sunflower oil)

I also drink coffee, and consume smokeless nicotine

Now my question is more of a micronutrient question, since I know my macros are good, is anything missing from here? I think my sodium is good since I salt food and use boullions, sometimes I eat salt in the morning. My potassium is good from the coffee. Initial electrolyte suspects are zinc and calcium, but I don't know about the other micronutrients which I might be missing.

I have lost a few pounds, however, I'm having trouble meeting my calories some days. Some days I'm only eating 800-1000 calories. I am assuming being under 1200 cal will hinder my progress?? I have not had a hunger feeling (and off and on no full feeling) for 10+ years. I just eat on a schedule, i eat portioned amounts, and if I don't eat for long periods of time I get nauseated and dizzy and I know i need to eat. 

I'd like to incorporate some snacks, but i also have high blood pressure & previously my cholesterol was a bit high(got it back down easily in 6months). I am concerned about eating most things people suggest as snacks like lots of cheese, lunch meat, charcuterie, bacon. While i do eat these on occasion, due to my other risk factors I'd like to stay away from stuff like that and pork rinds too. 
***I'd love some cholesterol friendly suggestions for snacking. I truly miss fruit & smoothies which were my go to snacks üò≠ 
***Also, I'd love to incorporate greek yogurt, but i cannot stand the taste of sucralose so I can't eat the keto friendly store brands. Would plain greek yogurt throw me out of ketosis? It only has about 7g of carbs, but also 7g of natural sugar...
***Anyone have a quick easy keto friendly granola that does NOT have coconut & almonds?

Breakfast: keto tortilla, eggs, salsa Verde, avocado, sour cream
Lunch: salmon & roasted veggies or chicken wings and roasted veggies
Dinner: fish& veggies, chicken & veggies.

1gv2g0l,keto,How do you cut out desserts? ,"I think I can call myself an advanced faster.
In my early 20s, I only ate one meal a day, and my protein source was the same thing every day, which was chicken breast and pea protein along with smoked salmon only once a week.
 Leafy greens were eaten only twice a week, which was the only vegetable source I consumed.
The only fruit I ate once a week was cherries. Oatmeals occasionally and the small amount of chocolates almost every day. 
Drinks were only water, no alcohol, no coffee, no juice, no tea, no green smoothie things, no milk. 
Fasting more than 18 hours every day, dry fasting 36 to 48 hours about once in two weeks. 
I think I did this 3 years. After this, I just started working out at gym and had a normal diet for 2 years. 
I did it back then because of my weight management, not knowing there's actually a type of diet called a keto diet or how to maximize the benefit from doing it without going this extreme.

Now I'm addicted to lattes, sweets, and cakes. 
Recently I'm doing 2 hours of yoga at home that includes a little core and hip exercises. 
30 minutes of walking, and sometimes I walk my apartment stairs from the first floor to the 12th floor. 

I normally fast 20 hours and eat within 4 hours. I'm eating animal proteins like eggs, chickens, yogurt, and mackerels. I've recently included broccolis, avocados, ans olive oils in my diet. 
But the problem is I can't cut out sugar. 
I eat a piece of cake or other desserts daily. 
I somehow developed this habit, got addicted to it, and can't get out of it.
Is it accepatble to drink a cup of latte or eat small desserts daily when doing a keto diet? 
or did you guys cut out sugar 100 percent?

1g65nna,keto,I messed up...,"Update: I gained a 3/4 pound, but not as bad as expected...so happy about that at least. Stomach is still not happy, so only taking in fluids and electrolytes today. Atkins bars are now trash.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the support. To make myself more clear, I am not beating myself up. My mess-up was more about the fact that my eating choice caused me a negative painful consequence, reminding me why I started trying to change my eating habits. I wasn't trying to imply that I had made some terrible mistake causing me to want to give up. Or that I had eaten a ridiculous amount of calories or anything like that.

But last night I got stressed and ate an Atkins chocolate bar. It just made me want more. Today I ate 3. I'm still in a calorie deficit, but my stomach is definitely not happy with me.

1flww95,keto,Peanut Butter Chocolate fans,"If you‚Äôre a fan of peanut butter, chocolate, and have been having a hard time reaching your macros, try this smoothie: (to have this smoothie, you need to have ~20g of net carbs you can part with. I start or end my day with this depending on how I‚Äôm feeling.)

- 30g banana (7g Carbs) OR avocado (idk the macros for that but it‚Äôs a great substitute and adds healthy fats!)
- Fairlife Chocolate protein shake (30g protein, 3 net carbs)
- 1/2 oikos vanilla protein yogurt (I used the 15g one so it shakes out to about ~7.5g of protein, 3.5 carbs)
- 1 to 1.5 tbsp skippy natural creamy peanut butter (4 net carbs for TWO tbsp, 7g protein. I didn‚Äôt use two bc I don‚Äôt love peanut butter, but it cuts the chalky aftertaste of protein shakes and adds to the sweetness!)
- as much ice as you‚Äôd like. The more, the better honestly. 

This came out to 17.5 carbs for me with nearly 43 grams of protein. It filled a 16oz cup with a small amount left over. If the carb count is too high, you can always split this and save the other half for the next day since it has no acids and will likely have minimal separation, just add more ice, blend and go!

 I had a very long day of running around and only ate one thing all day, and that was straight protein. I was ending my day with nearly all of my carbs left over and a huge amount of protein I needed to reach. Not only did this taste good, it satisfied whatever sweet craving I would have had by the end of the day, helped me reach the majority of my protein goal, kept me in ketosis, and helped me get full. I realize it‚Äôs not for everyone but I‚Äôve worked really hard to try to adjust to this lifestyle without giving myself an eating disorder, which proves hard every day because with an increase in protein comes the lack of appetite and suddenly it‚Äôs 6pm and you haven‚Äôt eaten anything all day. In doing that, I‚Äôve found really healthy, productive, and effective ways of eating that don‚Äôt feel as restrictive as they actually are. If anyone is missing their fix or wants to try something new, I recommend giving this a shot.

Happy eating, everyone! ‚ó°Ãà 

Edit: I am aware that this totals out to a large amount of carbohydrates for the average person on keto. I acknowledge that twice. What I also mentioned that I don‚Äôt think people are grasping is that I know what‚Äôs best for my body just like I‚Äôm assuming the vast majority of you do. With that, I also know how many carbs I should consume to keep me losing fat and in ketosis. It‚Äôs really important for all of us to recognize that not everyone is living with the same guidelines as the next person. Some people require higher or lower carbs than what google recommends when people attempt to start this, and that could be for a number of reasons. For me, I have always been successful on keto but the constant yo-yoing in my weight put my body into starvation and where I was once someone who could lose weight very quickly, it was now taking months to see the same weight fall off. After seeing a nutritionist and a huge series of evals from a number of specialists, I learned what I need to be most effective in this lifestyle. That means being flexible but mindful with MY carb intake. Everyone‚Äôs bodies and needs are different. If this post/recipe inspires you or is exactly what you needed, I‚Äôm so glad I could give that to you. If this isn‚Äôt for you, then it‚Äôs not for you. Adjust to your needs or ignore me all together but the messages and disrespect I‚Äôm getting are insane. If you lack self control, don‚Äôt buy, use or eat the damn banana. Why do I even have to say that to you????",2024-09-21 06:37:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1flww95/peanut_butter_chocolate_fans/
1f3ztpn,keto,Constant Dehydration/Waking up multiple times at night,"Hello everyone, I am looking for some advice. Yes I have checked the FAQs and have done A LOT of research into keto over the past couple of years.

I started keto about 2 years ago. I remember the flu and feeling sick then quickly feeling the best I have ever felt in my life. I cannot recall exactly what I was eating or how much water/electrolytes I consumed on a daily basis.

One day I started waking up at 3AM and it was like clockwork. I woke up at that time every morning no matter what. I looked into this and started taking potassium before bed. This seemed to solve the issue.

Can't remember the exact reason why (Maybe because dating on keto was tough) but I ended up stopping keto and going low carb.

I then tried animal based (High protein and fat and high fruits/no vegetables) this ended up completely screwing me up again and I found myself waking up sweating at 3AM again.

I started experimenting with carbs right after this and ended up being able to sleep through the night. 

Recently, I went on a vacation where I just said F it and ate everything in site. I was sleeping great on vacation. I came back and went back on my diet.

After vacation, my sleep was completed jacked up again and no matter what I did I could not fix it. I decided I wanted to go back to the good ole days of keto since those were the best times I can recall. 

Getting back into keto was quite easy. No flu this time around. The problem now is that I do not for the life of me know how to properly distribute my electrolytes (Again, I have tried the FAQs for this to no avail). 

I constantly feel dehydrated every second of the day and have a pounding headache most days. I also wake up sweating at 3AM with my mind racing.

Please let me know if I should change anything? I would love to be told I am doing something wrong at this point lol. 

FYI I am a 31 year old athlete, 6'5 210lbs and find I can consume more carbs while staying in ketosis. I work out 6 days a week and have done this for the past 15 years.

  
Diet: All meals are salted with the Redmond's/Potassium blend

1ep1uix,keto,How I Successfully Started Keto: My Practical Tips and What Worked for Me,"Hey, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of questions from people just starting on keto, so I wanted to share exactly what I did when I first began my journey. I have shared my journey in this community ""Lost 35kg, Reversed Diabetes & BP, and Dropped 13 Inches on Keto ‚Äì All While Cooking Everything at Home!"" These practical steps helped me, and hopefully, they can help you too!

**I Kept It Simple:**I didn‚Äôt overwhelm myself with complex recipes or trying to recreate carb-heavy dishes. I stuck to whole, unprocessed foods like meat, eggs, low-carb veggies, and healthy fats. For example, a typical meal for me was grilled chicken or chicken with curry, chicken cutlets, or chicken meatballs. I tried to stick to one recipe for a week, and the next week I tried the second one. It saved my time and mental energy.

**Staying Within Limits:** I focused on keeping my daily carb intake very low (under 20g) to get into ketosis quickly.

**Water Intake and Electrolyte Boost:** I drank plenty of water throughout the day‚ÄîMore than 3-4 Liters. This helped prevent dehydration, which can be a common issue in keto. I also used electrolyte water made from Lemon, Ginger, and Apple Cider with pink salt daily.

**Necessory Supplements:** I also took magnesium and potassium supplements which are necessary on Keto. If you are taking green leafy vegetable raw Salad or making smoothies and nuts regularly then supplements are not necessary. Smoothies or Salads and Nuts fulfill your magnesium and potassium requirements. I was taking Vitamin D3 and K2 tablets daily.

**Avoiding Processed Foods:** I steered clear of ‚Äúketo-friendly‚Äù processed products. Instead, I stuck to whole foods like meat, fish, eggs, nuts, and low-carb vegetables. This kept my diet clean and helped me avoid hidden carbs. Instead of using processed oil, I used Mustard oil only or Desi Ghee (made from butter). I could Olive oil on Keto but I didn't as it is a little bit expensive.

**Exercise:** I started walking for 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening. This also helped me lose weight quickly.

**Intermittent Fasting:** I started a Keto diet combined with intermittent fasting. I fasted for 16 hours and had 2 meals within an 8-hour window. During the fasting period, I drank electrolyte water and herbal tea but refrained from eating anything. It was difficult at first, but I eventually got used to it.

My entire lower is being done first (my upper will be a partial later).  I've read of things to eat and it's things like bananas, mashed potatoes, oatmeal, broth soups, eggs, smoothies, protein drinks, etc.  Soft foods, no spicy, no dairy, no tomatoes or acidic foods.

1dt0zh7,keto,"I want opinions, I guess kinda doing a pole here on things...","Hi all, long time lurker who infrequently posts now.

I'm currently no longer doing keto because of medical reasons after almost 2 years sudden nasty side effects popped up id has prior to keto.

On that note I'm still extreme low carb just not keto still high protein though.

But that said with my current needs the emphasis is more on lean protein. 

During keto I found high protein worked best anyway and protein powders helped a bunch. Plus they were a good way to flavor yogurt bowls or smoothies without added sugars.

Now, I'm a mentally disabled single mom on SSI and currently my snap is cut because of state of Texas f up.

I couldn't buy my normal bulk amount of protein powder because of that when I ran out last month. I get usually now sport which is why based and stevia sweetened off of Amazon. A 5 pound thing is less than $80. 

However I recently won a visa gift carb and went to a local heb looking at protein powders. I was looking for sucralose free and seed oils free because of my autoimmune condition and I avoid sucralose the most aside from sugar behind recent studies on its affects. I'm not particular on animal vs plant based but tend to have both because of seasonal allergies and the sinus and respiratory infections I sometimes get from them. I avoid dairy milk products during those times and whey powder is a nope because of that. 

That said most of the plant protein powders I've tried are slightly gritty so not really my thing. Well, id heard lots about sun warriors powder which is plant based. I know Thomas de lauer is a point of contension and he was the first I came across vouching for it. 

Well, heb had it and it was the best bang for buck at the time. It's not as gritty as the other ones I've used but enough I'm not a fan. I'm keeping it and using it until I can get better.

But after that id like to ask the community about their own protein powder preferences if you use them. I'm kinda wanting suggestions of stuff to try. And who better to ask then people who like me may have found it a life saver on a low carb protocol. 

Any ideas and suggestions? I'm all ears. Could definitely use some good input. ",2024-07-01 18:59:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1dt0zh7/i_want_opinions_i_guess_kinda_doing_a_pole_here/

My macros are 1710cal,25NC,112P,129F
I started late on cooking today 2pm but had cooked chicken thighs (skin-on), used salt free Dash seasoning, and used Birds Eye brocolli florets and cauliflower ate that felt satisfied full

My bad obviously didn‚Äôt research as much as i thought, just curious if I should tough it out bc I was eating a ridiculous amount of carbs/sugars (loved shredded wheat, baked potatoes, protein bars, smoothies etc). so figured maybe just the sudden change might be the cause but any help would be appreciated ",2024-06-10 01:08:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1dc9f2m/1st_day_keto_sudden_headache/
1d13k62,keto,Fifteen weeks in report,"Im 6ft 42yo M, currently 220ish.  my peak weight was about 330 in 2019 and Ive had multiple ups and downs in the loss process, although GW is somewhere in the 180-190 region.   Ive also  lost 100 lbs, 70lbs x 2, 50lbs x 2 before the 2019 peak and my tested RMR is about 500 cal per day lower than ""calculated value"" so I regain weight easily.

This is my third time committing to long term keto, and so far Im down around 30lbs in a little over 3 months, which Im very happy with.  I had previously gotten down to about 205 using a combination of keto, exercise, CICO and fasting, and I think Ive had 2 x 40-50lb regains, 1 x 30lb regains and 1 x 20lb regain in this process.  I had bumped back up close to 250 when I restarted keto a few months back.

**The good:**

Im almost never hungry despite only eating around 1500-1750 cal per day and losing on average close to 2 pounds a week on average so far

I have had far fewer sugar cravings since the first 3 weeks, which I definitely attribute to almost completely cutting out fake sugars (I have realized reliance on fake sugars is likely what led to keto being unsustainable for me other times), and also drinking very minimally and mostly avoiding processed foods helps.

I was  able to take a couple short holidays, drop off keto and hop right back on with no difficulty

Im successfully wearing the slimmest pants I was wearing before during my weight loss again

Have been able to maintain all my lifts during this time despite the weight loss, and body weight exercises like dips, pushups, pull-ups  reps are up significantly

I have a pretty busy life with work, masters classes, parenting and still doing social things, and if anything I have more energy now despite taking in less energy

**The bad:**

was hoping I would feel a benefit for ADHD and that has not happened, but my ADHD isnt too bad

I feel like my sleep quality  has gotten worse, and Im waking up more.  It's not awful but Im spending an extra 30-60 min in bed a day to compensate.

Definitely when Ive done HIIT sessions I do have less burst energy overall which is expected.

**Foods / macros:**

I try to get at least 100g protein, target 140ish , usually probably 110-125,   carbs under 30 rest in fat.

I do eat a lot of the same foods so I don't have to think about it, which many would find boring .

My breakfast most mornings is a smoothie with unflavored casein / whey (flavored protein powders have tons of fake sugar BTW) cut with cocoa, Ceylon cinnamon and inulin, 8oz water, golden milk inspired spices that I blend (turmeric, ginger, cayenne, five-spice), greens powder, creatine,  frozen Nespresso (about 1/2 shot), 1/4 cup frozen blueberries, frozen cream 100 cal and maybe a little extra cream depending on hunger, and around 5 drops of monk fruit extract.

My work lunch many days is frozen sliced grilled chicken about 40g protein worth, and about 6oz frozen chopped spinach, microwaved then I add about a TBLsp EVOO and some keto friendly sauce like avocado salsa, buffalo sauce, chimichuri, etc.

cheese or meat sticks available for snack, usually close to 100 cal

Beyond that, most of my meals follow the protein + veg + sauce.  I like using the egg white cartons and I'll usually mix about 5 eggs worth of whites with 2 whole eggs in a shakshuka.  Riced cauliflower, broccoli florets and asparagus are also common veg for me.

Right now Im planning to do keto indefinitely.  Could see experimenting with carb cycling at night if sleep gets worse",2024-05-26 15:15:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1d13k62/fifteen_weeks_in_report/

Now that I'm post-menopausal, I started again about two weeks ago and haven't experienced the loss I have in the past.

I've had the energy to get through my workouts and don't feel fatigued. My macros are 125 protein, 20 carbs, 125 fat and I've been about 50g short in both protein and fat most days.  I feel like I have to really force it to meet those macros.  I have a high fiber (psyllium, chia, flaxseed) superfood smoothie with my salad at lunch and it fills me up so much, I find I don't need the extra fat to stay satiated.  It ends up being about 1300 calories/day however, which is likely not enough to fuel my workouts.  I feel like my body is holding onto the extra fat rather than using it for fuel this time.

198jki1,keto,"Wanting to incorporate more veggies and leafy greens, help!","Hi everyone, me again! I'm hoping to find some good recipes or methods of cooking different veggies? I'm finding most of my meals have almost no veggies, and my carbs are mostly coming from the little bits of dairy I consume. I'm not wanting to go the carnivore route, so I figured I'd come here. 

I love roasting vegetables, particularly broccoli and brussel sprouts, but there's only so many times I can eat those. Though admittedly, I haven't even been doing that much. Frozen veg is always an option, but at least for what I can find, its mostly more broccoli, green beans, or a carrot/broccoli/cauliflower mix. Frozen veggies have been a life saver, and I'd totally love some ideas about that as well, because right now I basically microwave, drain, dump in a tupperware with some salt and pepper and that's about it. Which ends up kinda flavorless. 

I'd like to incorporate more veg and especially leafy greens, but I'm just not a salad eater, nor a smoothie drinker, and adding cooked spinach to something like eggs or soup is typically not an enjoyable experience for me. My solutions so far have been to coat veggies in olive oil, salt and pepper and roast, or in the case of leafy greens, I've found I enjoy kale sauted in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper, or, I tried out swiss chard sauted in bacon grease with bits of crispy bacon mixed in, and it was AMAZING. But that was ages ago (I really, really need to make that again), and I'm hoping for more variety than brussel sprouts, broccoli, kale and swiss chard.

How can I sneak veggies/leafy greens in? I'd love to become a salad person, and I'd love to eat more produce. I used to eat loads more produce pre-keto, I genuinely like veggies. For some reason, I'm finding it difficult now that I'm back on keto.

18avuny,keto,Giving myself new ground rules for starting keto again,"LONG post: just thought I should share this because I thought it might help some people if they‚Äôre wondering what they could do to lose weight faster or why they might be struggling to lose. Not everything is gonna be applicable here to everybody of course but it could help some people. 

Background about me and my personal keto journeys: 
In summer 2020 and spring of 2021, I had great success doing my first and second rounds of keto. I‚Äôm female, early 20s, 5‚Äô1‚Äù and before the first time doing keto, I was about 160lbs. After I finished keto the second time, I was around 125lbs and my body actually stayed at around 130-135lbs without any dieting. Both times I did keto, I was only on the diet for short periods of time and the weight just flew off of me (with a combination of being in school or doing work where I was standing/moving all day.)

But then I go pregnant in the summer of 2021 and my body has been a mess ever since. After baby I had some issues with my thyroid that caused massive weight gain and at my heaviest I was about 190lbs, actually getting close to 200lbs briefly. Which is mind boggling for me to think about. I‚Äôm currently around 170lbs and the weight just slowly came off when I got off maternity leave and went to work again where I was standing/moving all day. I tried and failed a handful of times to get back into keto because previously, it had been so easy. Imagine my frustration when the weight just would NOT budge. And then recently I‚Äôve realized that there‚Äôs a lot of things I need to do differently this time around on keto if I want it to work for me. My ultimate goal is to be about 120lbs and lean/muscular but my more reasonable goal is to get to around 130lbs. By the time I‚Äôm about 140lbs, I know I‚Äôll already feel much happier and healthier than I am now. 

I‚Äôve just come off a 3 day water fast (primarily for spiritual reasons but I also decided to take this as an opportunity to start keto again but to do it ‚Äúproperly‚Äù, for me personally) 

Here is my personal list of ground rules that I think is really going to help me see the results I want: 

1. Limit dairy and absolutely NO cheese. Since having baby, there‚Äôs just something about my body/metabolism and cheese that nulls any sort of progress from keto for me. I‚Äôm not lactose intolerant but cheese just backs me up so badly in the bathroom when I‚Äôm on keto. I used it as a crutch a lot for any of my cravings during the times I tried to do keto after having my son. I know now that it‚Äôll just make it not even worth it for me to do keto cuz I just won‚Äôt see any progress if I do. 

2. No keto approved sweets/desserts, either store made or from a recipe at home. There just seems to be something about the sweeteners that sets me back and again, makes it not even worth it for me to do keto anyway cuz I just don‚Äôt see any progress when I eat these things. 

3. Intermittent fasting for sure and hopefully OMAD will be part of my routine this time around (but I will leave room for some keto snacks that I will list later). I‚Äôve been doing intermittent fasting without keto for a bit more than a month now and it‚Äôs become pretty easy so I think that will help. My eating window has been between 1pm-9pm and if I do OMAD I think I‚Äôll just have supper at home around 6-7pm

4. Stick to a basic meal that I can make and eat easily everyday and make small changes to so I don‚Äôt get bored. So it‚Äôll be: 
- a protein like chicken, beef or pork (seasoned obviously and maybe with a bit of tzatziki for some extra fat)
- two strips of bacon
- green veg like broccoli, brussel sprouts, asparagus etc. cooked in a lot of butter or coconut oil
-Pork rinds with half a salted avocado to dip it in 
- I can also have a bio steel electrolyte drink, even though it has stevia, it thankfully doesn‚Äôt seem to set me back or hurt my stomach. (But things like zevia soda do some gnarly things to my guts and also give me wicked calf cramps so those are gonna be a no for me)
- if necessary for satiety/ additional nutrients, I also have a keto smoothie recipe that I can make if I‚Äôm not feeling satisfied by all that. Recipe: (not exact measurements cuz I always just eye-ball it)
1 tbsp each of ground hemp, flax, chia
Roughly 1 cup of goat milk or low carb nut milk
Probably half a cup spinach
1/4 cup or so of mixed frozen berries
1 scoop Genuine Health brand fermented organic vegan protein -vanilla flavour. (This seems to be the only protein powder I can have that doesn‚Äôt 1. Rip my guts apart like Premier brand does and 2. Isn‚Äôt disgusting like the Vegan Pure brand)

I personally feel like I really need to have consistency in this form of knowing exactly what I‚Äôm going to eat because having too many options gives me decision paralysis. Plus then I know exactly what to buy in the store and don‚Äôt blow a bunch of money on stuff that‚Äôs just gonna sit in the freezer or go bad. Some people may not like this idea but for me, I think this is the only way I can see the results I want quickly. I‚Äôm not aiming to do keto as a long term lifestyle diet, it‚Äôs just something that I know has worked for me in the past to drop weight quickly and usually it stays off for awhile afterward too as long as I remain moderately active and mindful of what I‚Äôm eating. 

5. Heavily limit any snacks but I have a good list to go to if I feel I need it: 
- medium boiled eggs 
- poached eggs with hollandaise and a splash of Valentina sauce
- smoked salmon 
- shrimp fried in butter and seasoned with steak spice (huge dopamine hit in my brain from this one lol)
- kale chips 
- bacon 
These are all great keto things that seem to scratch that reward centre itch in my brain when I want to treat myself. 
I also have a few other keto meal options I can make if I‚Äôm feeling really bored from the daily one I listed earlier. 

6. Having a cheat day goal in mind. Christmas is coming up and I am not gonna cheat once until then. I am so determined about this and I think seeing that I could do a 3 day fast with little issue will be a great motivator for me to not fall off the wagon

7. After I get to a point where I‚Äôm happy with my results, I am going to get involved in some sort of physical activity as a hobby. I don‚Äôt like going to the gym and I don‚Äôt like exercising. I‚Äôm just not the kind of person who can motivate myself solo at the gym. But when I do some sort of class, it makes it fun for me. I did tae kwon do as a kid and I think I will do that again. The reason I want to lose weight through keto first is because I am incredibly out of shape now and I don‚Äôt think I would enjoy it as much now as I would when I‚Äôm not winded after 2 mins of running. When I did keto the first two times successfully, I had tons of energy and I felt so physically strong so I know that will help when I start exercising more.

17za1x7,keto,weak/heavy legs on keto,"After ditching the banana in my daily green smoothie (that I did not realize was super high in sugar) about two weeks ago, I am finally *actually* on a keto diet and not just a low carb one. 

Problem is, I've been noticing that my legs often feel heavy and get calf cramps when I stretch my legs after waking up in the morning. The worst part, however, is that my legs feel weaker as well. I play competitive soccer, and I've noticed that my legs tire out a lot quicker than pre-keto.

From what I've seen, the usual suspect is electrolytes - but I take magnesium supplements daily (350mg) and have about 5~10 spinach leaves in my aforementioned smoothie alongside an avocado or two a day, so that should be enough magnesium and potassium. That just leaves sodium, which I admittedly do not consume anywhere close to the recommended 5000mg. The amount I usually consume in a day through various foods is about 2000~3000mg.

Is the difference between 5000mg and 2/3000mg of sodium significant enough to be causing this? Or should I suspect something else?",2023-11-19 23:18:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/17za1x7/weakheavy_legs_on_keto/

I'm eating about 20-25 grams of carbohydrates a day and lots of fat (e.g. beef, pork, olive oil, butter, sour cream, cheese, eggs, etc.). But I still feel pretty hungry within a couple of hours of most meals.

For example, my breakfast today was a smoothie made with nut milk, whey isolate protein powder, 1/2 avocado, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, 2 teaspoons of MCT oil, a tablespoon of flax seed, and a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa.  With a couple of ice cubes added to the blender it came to about 2 cups.  Lots of fat, under five net carbs,  and plenty of calories. But I was hungry again in less than three hours.

Any thoughts and/or suggestions?  Thanks!

170tifn,keto,Title: Liberated from Diabetes: My Keto Journey,"In May 2022, I embarked on a life-changing journey towards better health through the ketogenic diet. At that time, my lab results were alarming‚Äîmy HbA1c was at a worrisome 9.7, and my total cholesterol had reached 202. It's important to note that these cholesterol readings were taken after I had been consuming oats three times a day consistently for five years. Unfortunately, despite my dedication to oats, they had failed to make any significant impact on my diabetes or total cholesterol levels.

Today, I'm thrilled to share the remarkable progress I've made on my keto journey. After consistent dedication and commitment to this lifestyle, my HbA1c has plummeted to an astonishing 5%, and my total cholesterol has significantly improved, now standing at 170.

So, what's been my secret? I've been following a strict keto diet, focusing on wholesome and nourishing choices. Here's a glimpse of my daily routine:

Minimal Cheese: While cheese can be a delicious part of keto, I've chosen to consume it in moderation to maintain a balanced approach.

Avocado Mayonnaise: A creamy and healthy choice, I've replaced traditional mayonnaise with avocado mayonnaise to keep my fats healthy and heart-friendly.

Eggs Daily: Incorporating eggs into my daily diet has been a game-changer. They provide essential nutrients and healthy fats.

Sardines and Salmon: These fatty fish are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, helping support heart health and overall well-being.

Moderate Meat Consumption: I've found a balanced approach to meat consumption that works for me, ensuring I meet my protein needs without overindulging.

Keto Smoothies: My mornings begin with keto-friendly smoothies. I blend almond milk, avocado oil, plain whey protein powder, raspberries, and blackberries for a delicious and nutritious start to the day.

My journey to better health has been nothing short of transformative. The keto lifestyle has not only helped me regain control over my diabetes but has also drastically improved my overall cholesterol levels. It's a testament to the power of making informed dietary choices and embracing a lifestyle that prioritizes well-being.

I hope my journey serves as an inspiration to those seeking to take control of their health through dietary changes. Remember, every small step toward a healthier you is a victory worth celebrating. Here's to a brighter, healthier future for us all! üí™üåü

14z848h,keto,MY KETO STAPLE FOODS,"Here‚Äôs the list of my keto staple foods, hope some of you will find it useful üëç

1Ô∏è‚É£COFFEE-> coffee helps me to get into ketosis faster. If I can afford it I buy organic, mold free coffee, but if I am low on a budget I just stick to regular instant coffee. I drink it black with a pinch of salt (it enhances the flavor). 

2Ô∏è‚É£DARK CHOCOLATE (99-100%)& raw cacao powder-> I love to have dark chocolate as a dessert or hot chocolate drink (just raw cacao powder, a pinch of salt, hot water and maybe a splash of coconut milk). Chocolate is high in magnesium, it makes me feel good and relaxed. It‚Äôs such a treat for me. 

3Ô∏è‚É£SALT-> I like Maldon salt flakes, but I usually stick to pink Himalayan salt as it‚Äôs more affordable for me. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ELECTROLYTES-> I always neglected electrolytes. I thought I don‚Äôt need them and I am doing just fine without them. But when I incorporate them during my fasting window I felt a big difference in the way I feel. My energy levels increased a lot and I felt more hydrated. 

5Ô∏è‚É£NON-STARCHY VEGETABLES-> my favorite one is cauliflower. You can make so much with this stuff. Add it to smoothies, replace mash potatoes with cauliflower mush. I also like stuff like broccoli, zucchini, Brussels sprouts, eggplant, spinach, mushrooms. I find salads and raw vegetables not as appealing and not as digestible as cooked vegetables.

6Ô∏è‚É£MEAT-> I personally love all types of meat poultry, ruminant meats, offal. I like both lean and fatty cuts. If I have time I like to experiment with different types of meat. But I usually stick to simple stuff: ground turkey/ chicken/ beef, chicken  rotisserie, beef/ pork roast. If I feel like I need extra iron I would have stuff like chicken/ beef liver. I also like to have some bone marrow for extra fat.

7Ô∏è‚É£EGGS-> scramble eggs, boiled eggs, PSMF bread. I am not a big fan of yolks. Shame on me because they are super nutritious. So I mostly have whites and just throw a yolk here and there. 

8Ô∏è‚É£FISH-> I love fish. Canned tuna and salmon are super convenient. But fresh cod, tuna lion, salmon are also great options. 

9Ô∏è‚É£SEAFOOD-> prawns and shrimps are my favorite seafood. I also like scallops, octopus, calamari but they tend to be more expensive. 

üîüCONDIMENTS/ SPICES-> I am not a big fan of condiments and spices. So I usually end up just using salt and pepper. For the condiments I like to put vinegar/ lemon juice on my food. Sometimes I would also have some quality mayo, mustard, hot sauce if I fancy it. 

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£COLLAGEN/ BEEF PROTEIN ISOLATE/ EGG WHITE POWDER-> if I feel that I need extra protein or I am baking something I would use these protein powders/ supplements. 

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£DAIRY-> I try to avoid dairy as best as I can. It does not agree with my body, I get headaches, breakouts and digestive issues when I have it. But sometimes I will indulge in some sour cream, Greek yoghurt, cottage cheese or tvarog. I treat dairy more like a treat. I have it maybe once/ twice a month. 

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£SWEETENER (MONK FRUIT/ STEVIA)-> I use them in mostly in my coffee. They are not ideal as they still cause the desire/ craving for sweet taste. But I use just the tiny amount (few drops) and it‚Äôs only in my coffee at morning and afternoon so I don‚Äôt get too harsh on myself for it. 

I do high protein version of keto (Maria Emmerich style) most of my fat intake is coming from fatty meat I eat. I don‚Äôt use stuff like added oils. Sometimes I would you some butter, ghee, tallow, coconut cream if I feel that I need some extra fat. 

Other thing I would also consume from time to time are non-fortified nutritional yeast flakes. They are a extra source of B-vitamins. 

But really if I just want to simply my life and make my diet as effortless and easy as possible I would just stick to eating animal flesh (meat/ fish/ offal/ seafood) and vegetables.",2023-07-14 06:05:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/14z848h/my_keto_staple_foods/
14q1xyo,keto,planning for fourth of july meals two days after treat on my sons 13th b day,"Hi all, been here for a bit. Been doing keto and if for 1.5 Years now and almost reached all my goals. I did a year baby stepping changes using more of a cico method prior.

Yesturday was my sons 13th b day. I mostly stuck with keto safe foods, i originally planned his mommy and me celebration to be is goibg to a local public park with a splash pad and grilling hot dogs, having some kibd of chip sub, and some store bought mini vanilla cupcakes. I can fit one cupcake which is 1/3 serving in my macros if i nix doing the keto hot dog bun.

It was dangerously hot so we nixed that amd did at home cuddle time and podcasts instead. Still had a hot dog, keto coffee, smoothie, whisps, and one cupcake myself. Kid had 3 hot dogs, home made low carb electrolyte water, a sunkist soda, life savers, and 6 mini cupcakes . I usually dont allow that much sugar for him but its his b day, so i let him cut loose. 

Anywho, tomorrow is the fourth of july. Big holiday, celebrating as party of 1. Fourth of july usially means lots of chips, dips, hot dogs, burgers, bbq ribs, potato salad, coleslaw, fries, sweets including ambrosia with marshmallows, armadillo eggs, etc.

Those are things im familiar with for fourth of july. Since i recentky did a treat im kinda trying to be conservative with what i eat. Add in im dealing with that time of the month and kinda loading up on organ meats or red meat because i bleed heavy and have a history of anemia.

Well, lets say my celebratory meal im thinking fresh green beans cooked with beef heart, skin on chicken thighs shredded and cooked with 2 tbsp of a pretty low carb bbq sauce, and a potato salad knock off made from turnip, egg, onion, pickle, and a expensive organic alvacado oil mayo ive got on hand. Its not a huge variety of foods but i think its a decent meal.

Ive calculated the cals for that as well as macros and we are talking 7.9 G carbs, 815 cals, 91.2 G protien, 41.7 G fat just with this meal.

My carb limit is 30g net, doing more of a high protien keto, and aiming to hit 1315 cals dead on between my strict 2mad meal structure. 

Figured giving a post like this aroubd the holiday might help others with ideas to work arpubd multiple back to back celebrations and how u can every now and then indulge with a really inhealtgy option for a very special occasion but it not harm ur progress if u think and plan ahead and only choose one treat not entire treat meal or tteat day. 

And, next day go back to business as usual with what u have been doing . I mean a kids 13th b day with a kid who likes to share, well my bot wants me tp eat the same meal as him and share cake with him. So  we both had hot dogs and mini cupcakes. Him with bun and ketchup and 2 servings of cupcakes. Me sans bun dry and paired with other things and 1/3 serving cupcakes. We ate some of the same food which made my boy happy but threw in things that were very much strict clean keto for me to get my needs met.  Its doeable for those out there struggling with these issues if u think and plan properly",2023-07-04 02:10:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/14q1xyo/planning_for_fourth_of_july_meals_two_days_after/

In a ¬£5 meal deal you could get a steak sandwich that sells for ¬£4.50 while you may only have 1 poor vegetarian sandwich option.

Or Co-Op. A bland vegetable samosa as a snack and the most basic cheese sandwiches for the main.

I finally thought I'd hit the jackpot with Waitrose offering. A pesto pasta salad, a large vegetable samosa, and a smoothie for a fiver, until I checked my receipt and discovered that the pesto pasta wasn't included.

Sainsbury's haloumi wrap is nice but then you've got the lack of snack options. A nice big sausage roll, or some carrot sticks and hummus. However this still remains my go-to, opting for Dairylea Dunkers as a snack which at least provides some entertainment.

12ydegb,vegetarian,Greek inspired Lentil and Rice Pilaf Soup,"Hi all!

I made this dish tonight and it was so tasty I had two bowls (it was also my main meal of the day as I‚Äôm on an anti inflammatory diet and eat a proper meal once or twice a day outside a smoothie).

Benefits:
Nutrient dense and filling

Protein and good carb rich meaning a satiated belly, and no blood sugar spikes for those concerned with glucose issues

Gluten free and irritant free.


Recipe:

In olive oil, I saut√©ed some garlic and onions. 

Dried onions will do in a pinch.


Added some Celtic salt and a pinch of black pepper, a little oregano and parsley. 


Once that has browned, add fresh dill and tomato passata and about a cup and a half of water along with half a vegetable stock cube.

Separately I had boiled some rice which I added. Along with half a can or so of tinned lentils. 

Leave to simmer for about 10-15.

Added some more lentils.  More olive oil.  A little more herbs to taste. 

Added baby spinach in the last 5 minutes.  Turn up the heat to let the mixture thicken and reduce.  

Final dash of olive oil over plated dish. 

This was so quick, and delicious.  It will be lunch tomorrow, too! 
This would work well as a frozen meal prep.  Would go well with added capsicum, mushrooms, zucchini I think.

If you make it, let me know! And don‚Äôt be afraid to be generous with the dill, olive oil and garlic.

Maybe homemade or another brand is better, but it tasted 'wild' if you get my drift. I made milk with Great Northern Beans and it was pretty good, but I liked it better warm then when it chilled.

Coconut- The best on here in terms of health. It is full of fats that help keep you full and do other wonderful things. I get the Silk brand. If you make a smoothie with that, beans, and some kinda sweet fruit and a touch of greens, you can pretty much live off of it.

Oat- The silk oat milk was pretty good, but the homemade one was too starchy for my taste. It is the easiest and fastest to make as you do not need to cook it, but it is the worst one one here, the times I made it anyway. 

Pea-If made with yellow peas it is pretty good, reminds me of health drinks in aftertaste, which I like. Black eyed peas make okay milk, but it needs to be sweetened and maybe just used for smooties or cooking.

Rice-Not bad but very watery. My second pant milk I drunk for a while.",2022-03-26 16:42:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/toxhxz/my_take_on_a_few_plant_milks_i_have_tried/
tc65c6,vegetarian,How have you adjusted your vegetarian meals as food costs have risen?,"Many parts of the world are being hit with significant inflation.  I saw a segment on MSNBC saying that in parts of the USA grocery costs were up 10% over last year. In my country grocery prices are up by about 6% compared to last year. A lot of the increases have been in meat, so I‚Äôm not affected, but fruits, vegetables and most packaged basics (like canned beans or flour) are up too.  Have prices risen in your area?  How have you adapted your eating? 

Personally, I‚Äôm using more frozen veggies (I love roasting broccoli and cauliflower straight from frozen!) and making more smoothies with frozen fruit. I‚Äôm also working really hard to use up what I have in my pantry before I buy more of anything. For example, I made a baked pasta dish that was supposed to use penne, but I had some gluten-free bean-based spaghetti in the pantry so I used that instead, even though it changed the look and feel (and taste!) of the recipe.",2022-03-12 02:14:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/tc65c6/how_have_you_adjusted_your_vegetarian_meals_as/

nuu52a,vegetarian,Using cashews to bulk out foods- is possible to over-consume?,"Hi all, beginner here :) to preface my question, my partner and I are exploring vegetarian diets. I'm not totally new to cooking vegetarian meals but my partner is, and he is more inclined at this time to buy pre-processed meat substitutes. I am taking a different approach and thinking about starting from the whole foods and making my own substitutes for our favourite meals.

I bought a bulk pack of cashew pieces (baker's quality cashew crumbs) so I can put them into vegan yoghurt, smoothies, curries, etc. I also know there are some yummy recipes out there to make cashew cream and desserts, and loads more things. I'm basically going to go to town and trial out a bunch of things.

I'm not too concerned about consuming too much fat from nuts. But are there any other things I should be mindful of, such as toxins from eating cashews and other seeds and nuts in large quantities? I don't expect I'll be eating them raw very often, so they will go into meals.

n4z8x5,vegetarian,Unintentionally vegetarian and now committed!,"Hello all. Apologies if this is not a normal post for the subreddit. I just thought I'd give a quick explanation as to how I've become vegetarian.

After I regained taste due to its loss when I had COVID, meat began to taste very...disgusting. Apparently, this is not a common thing, something around 7% of people post-COVID find meat (specifically red meat) to taste like raw flesh. That happened to me!

Up until this, I loved BBQ, cheeseburgers, pepperoni pizza, steak, so on and so forth. I did have a vegetarian phase in college (lasted a month, not a bad month!), so I'm not totally new to this. But it's definitely surprised me so far.

Okay, it's only been a week. But I'm someone who orders through DoorDash a lot. I like to find hot dog carts on the street. I'm not healthy overall and food is usually what makes me happy when going through a tough time.

I guess I'm just surprised. I'm loving this.

I discovered the other day I absolutely adore zucchini. And yellow peppers!

For the first few days, I ate mostly protein; bread with peanut butter, honey and granola. KIND bars. Nuts. Beans. That sort of thing.

Then, I got a frozen veggie pizza. I've had salads, stir fry, avocado toast, smoothies, etc. They've all been great. Nothing beats the feeling of *not* being a total greaseball. My acid reflux is real bad. But it's already gotten better.

Anyway, point is: I didn't mean to become vegetarian. I involuntarily lost my love for meat. And it's starting to be replaced by a love for much more natural foods!

I've even lost a little bit of my gross beer belly...wow!

I might stick around here and see what cool recipes y'all cook up. I could use the help.",2021-05-04 21:47:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/n4z8x5/unintentionally_vegetarian_and_now_committed/

le41zb,vegetarian,"In a recent post, a lot of people are claiming it's tone deaf to say being vegetarian is cheaper/easier. I'm here, along with the entire developing world, to tell you about how to create a foundational diet, and just how privileged you sound.","I'm in awe of the sheer number of people in a recent post who said it's cheaper and easier to be an omnivore than it is to be a vegetarian.  While there are a select few instances of extreme conditions, such as being disabled in a food desert where you rely on meals prepared by others, the majority of people are able to eat for much cheaper if they eat vegetarian.

Living in developed countries has led to an abundance of meat products available, however, this is a luxury.  Vegetables grow from sunlight, water, and soil.  This is basically free.  Animals need food, water, space, time, and fancy processing to not get you sick.  This inherently makes it more expensive to grow meat compared to growing vegetables.

The universal stable diet is rice and beans/lentils.  You can survive on this.  You can survive on potatoes and butter.  You can survive on a lot of things you wouldn't realize are enough.  These things aren't glamorous, but they're just as glamarous and easy to prepare as meat containing dishes.  You don't need refrigeration for beans or rice, and it has an extremely long shelf life, either dried or canned.  Again, these are universally available and universally consumed by even the poorest.

If you want a cheap and easy vegetarian diet, you need to start with these staples.  Meal prep, plan ahead, find a system that works for you.  Do you need canned beans and a rice cooker?  Go for it.  Dried beans are honestly just as easy, but they do require an hour or two on the stove after soaking overnight.  I have a pressure cooker and rarely use it because when you make beans as a staple of your diet, you can start soaking them at any time.  It makes no difference if they won't be ready for tonight, because I'll just cook and eat them tomorrow.

Pressure cookers are also getting increasingly affordable, and things like instantpots can be used for tons of different things besides pressure cooking.  There's a great market of secondhand kitchen appliances that are still perfectly good, so check Craigslist, check Facebook market place, check with relatives and friends who might have an old machine they are willing to sell.  Also, they make non-electric pressure cookers that go right on the stove, so look for those too.

Also, remember that beans exist in many forms.  Black beans, red lentils, black lentils, kidney beans, chickpeas, red beans, adzuki (sp?) beans, besan, and more.  Hummus, refried beans, dessert bean paste, sambar, daal, dosa (which also contains rice), tofu, and soy milk are all made of beans.  You don't always have to have them in their whole form.

Once you've gotten that down to a good system, you're set to build off it.  Buy what's available and within your means to enhance the staples.  The general rule is to prioritize nutrition and then focus on the flavor.  Most of the time, just adding basic proteins and fats will naturally enhance the flavor.

The first add-in tier is eggs, dairy products (ignore if vegan).  Eggs are easy and cheap, I add them to any meal for increased nutrients.  Sour cream is cheap and tastey.  Cheese is a vegetarian's closest cousin to meat if you miss the flavor.  Cottage cheese, paneer, ricotta, and yogurt are also awesome and can be made at home just from milk and a one agent (either an acid for the first three or from existing yogurt for yogurt).  Egg/dairy products can really enhance both flavor and nutrition (animal fats for healthy hormone production, B12 for energy and metabolism, and certain amino acids for general life functions), and are usually a quick add-in.  The best part is they're still cheaper and easier than meat.  

Next is vegan proteins like tofu and seitan.  I don't recommend putting it this high in the priority if you are ovo-lacto, but I do recommend if you're vegan.  Get tofu at an Asian market and it'll be dirt cheap, like $1.50 for a brick which is enough for at least two meals.  Look online for the cheapest wheat gluten powder, mix with oil, water, and spices (especially soy sauce, besan/chickpea flour, mushroom powder, and nutritional yeast for the amino acids and B12) and MSG for that umami flavor, then boil or steam until cooked.  It takes time, but it's so cheap and tasty. 

I also strongly recommend building up an arsenal of spices.  The first things I'd get are iodized salt, sugar, vinegar, oil, and MSG.  These are cheap codes for your taste buds and are very cheap and shelf stable.  Also, some sort of broth base or bullion.  I use ""better than bullion vegetable broth base"" which is $5 for like 76 servings.  It drastically elevates flavor for cheap.

After that look for spice blends you like.  They're more expensive than the individual spices, but you can recreate it once you like it.  Adobo, garam masala, curry powder, five spice powder, and a good chili powder are great starts.  I recommend anything with little to no salt so you're just paying for flavor and not spiking your sodium intake.

The next thing to get is flour.  It's cheap and can be made into infinite forms.  Wheat flour can make tortillas, roti, bread, pasta, you name it.  Make a roux and turn that into various sauces for dishes.  Perfect for if you either get bored with rice or if you have extra time and want to make a meal special.  Don't forget about other grains as well.  Chickpea flour has good nutrition (and is dirt cheap at indian stores under the name besan), rice flour can be made into mochi, and there's plenty of others than may be cheap in your area.  Even potato flakes are practically as cheap and easy to store as flour.

Next, get you some long term vegetables.  These should be available everywhere without question and can keep for weeks.  Onions, garlic, ginger, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, cabbage, certain squashes, dried peppers (learn how to use them, ask me if you want to know more).  These can add cheap nutrition and bulk.  They can also serve as the basis for many homemade sauces and soups.

The next level is canned and frozen vegetables.  This is a fast easy way to add nutrition that's available everywhere and will keep a long time.  One great meal is a stir fry with all frozen vegetables, a stir fry sauce, and tofu.  Get the stir fry sauce and tofu from the nearest Asian market to cut costs, then sprinkle in MSG for authentic flavor.  Serve with rice or noodles for a super quick and cheap meal that will be on the table faster and cheaper than ordering takeout.  

I'm also a huge fan of pickling my own vegetables.  1 cup boiling water, 1/2 cup vinegar (white or apple cider), 1 tablespoon sugar, and 1 teaspoon of salt.  This is the pickling liquid recipe I use, then just toss in chopped vegetables that are close to going bad.  Cabbage, carrots, peppers, cauliflower, and onions are some of my favorites.  Add a few whole mustard seed and whole black peppercorns for even more flavor.

The next tier is cheap sauces.  Salsas of all different kinds, tomato sauces, stir-fry sauces, ketchup, mustard, simmer sauces/curries/gravies.  Look for things in a can, as they can be cheaper but still really tastey.  These are all enhancers and don't add a ton of necessary nutrition.  However, they tend to last a long time and can transform the flavor of these same old foundational items.  Once you start to like a certain sauce, learn how to make it at home for cheap.

The next tier of add-ins are the mid-tier stable vegetables.  Peppers are in a league of their own, and are almost necessary for flavor.  Tomatoes are as well.  Then there's virtually anything in stock and on sale at your local market.  Learn how to prepare things and remember the recipes from year to year when that vegetable is in season.  I'm hesitant to put this so far down the list, as you should probably try to get a least one of these each time you go shopping, but it's technically not *necessary*.

The next tier is short term items, strictly for flavor, like fresh herbs.  Cilantro, green onion/scallion, parsley, basil, mint, etc.  Buy these only if you have an immediate use because they'll go bad faster than a cop with a complex given some power and immunity.  I personally but cilantro every week and green onion every other week.  It costs like $0.50 or $1.00 each at most, but I also cook almost everything fresh because I have the time, and these really transform a dish.

The penultimate tier is meat substitutes.  These are an expensive luxury, but they're fast and tastey.  Add to a dish to really elevate it.  Tbh, I rarely buy these (except a pack of frozen veggie burgers once a month for a really quick meal) because once you learn how to cook with spices, these no longer taste that good.

The last tier is supplements.  If you're not getting enough of something from your diet, get a supplement.  They're not usually as good as getting it from food, and you should try to change your diet to increase the amount of that nutrient you're getting.  For example, use cast iron pans to get more iron or just eat more beans and lentils (I know it's obvious, but look into the specifics for whatever nutrient you need).  Protein powders/bars can also be a very cheap source of protein, so don't think they're just for body builders!

______

In a separate category are fruits and nuts.  These are optional, but are great for added nutrition.  I'm blessed to have some good money, so I eat dried fruit and nuts with yogurt everyday for breakfast.  There are cheaper options like bananas and apples with peanut butter.  Some other options are mixing peanut butter, hoisin sauce, and sriracha in equal parts for a delicious asian peanut sauce, mixing peanut butter with milk (dairy or non-dairy substitute) to make a dessert peanut sauce, or grinding cashews into paste and adding it to sauces to make them creamier.

For fruits, frozen fruit can be a good way to introduce otherwise expensive fruit into your diet for cheaper.  They can go in smoothies, be turned into sauces, or even just eaten.  Frozen fruit doesn't go bad quickly (unless you keep thawing it), and it's usually fully prepared.  I personally love making mango lassi with yogurt, milk, frozen mangos, and green cardamom or cinnamon as a cheaper alternative.

Fresh fruit can also be very cheap when in season if you're in a place that offers this.  It's not a necessary part of your diet, but it introduces variety and some good antioxidants.  You can even freeze your own for cheaper than pre frozen if you find a good deal.

________________

I could go on about this forever, and I may even release a meal plan and shopping list (although be warned, I cook everything from scratch and a lot a ton of time because I love it).  

My point is that it's far cheaper to eat vegetarian if you're eating a vegetarian diet.  Don't eat a substituted meat eater's diet.  It's like buying clothes at a big and tall shop and tailoring them down to your size.  Of course it's going to be harder and more work.  You may live in an area with 90% big and tall stores, but you need to take a little bit of time to find the other 10% of store that you may not be familiar with that do have clothes in your size.

Look for Indian markets, Chinese/Eastern Asian markets, Latino markets.  These tend to have lots of foods based around vegetarian diets, and they have them cheap.  You'll quickly find shortcuts like ginger/garlic paste and premade spice mixes at Indian markets.  Suddenly, it's super cheap and quick to make things like chana masala, stir fry, lentil soup, and other dietary staples from other countries right at home. 

As a follow up, I'll say to not try to eat the exact diet of these other countries.  Sure, you just found cheap lentils, but don't think you can suddenly just make fully meals with fancy chutneys and dosa for pennies.  Use these stores to find what's cheap, and easy and then add just that item.  Fusion meals are your new lifestyle.  

Unfortunately, there's not a shortcut, and it will take a full day to go shopping, learn a new recipe, and cook.  However, there are tons of resources online like this sub and /r/eatcheapandhealthy, with people going through this also.  Learn from their hardwork, and within a few months, you'll be an expert.

Finally, you can have this lifestyle at home and still enjoy eating with your friends.  Don't stress if a couple meals a week are just side dishes at a restaurant or at a friend's house.

k9njcp,vegetarian,On (great) blenders,"So... I got a Vitamix recently. I'm gonna go there and say I'm American and I have not seen a piece of machinery made in my country in this decade that made me feel the pride for American Manufacturing that must have once radiated this nation. I've had blenders before that jam when you load them wrong or just work them too hard for what they're built for. I easily grow frustrated with inferior technology (engineer) and my experiences with these machines kind of made me give up on purees. And it's honestly not the fault of those manufacturers for the performance of their machines, the engineers aren't given enough to build with for what it would cost to build a truly great machine of that nature. And so consumers buy the consumer product, and it mostly works okay enough, and especially for the price.

And so most people don't experience what an industrial grade blender can do for them - not directly anyway. They may experience it in restaurants, but that is hardly the same because all they see is the finished product and not the process.

It is another thing entirely to see what a great blender can do to whole foods. The experience has been an eye opening one for a culinary novice like me. For instance, to take an entire butternut squash, just chop it in half, roast it in the oven with a whole onion cut in half, unpeeled garlic clove, then essentially just throw it all into a blender for a few minutes and have this beautiful puree come out of it that tastes like heaven and is actually good for me... I can't say how happy it's made me. Also in hindsight the fact that a whole food diet would be best for me seems obvious but... yeah. It's another thing to live it. Lesson learned.

The results have been astounding. I've lost like eight pounds in the last two weeks (nothing worrisome, as it's not more than 2-3% body mass loss per week :blush: ) eating green smoothies and roasted veggie/fruit soups. I'm typically skeptical of consumption bringing me any real happiness and I honestly didn't think four blades and a 2HP engine could have such a profound effect on my life. I was wrong. I have so much more energy. I wake up in 30 - 60 seconds, fully awake in the morning. I'm drinking multiple glasses of red wine EVERY NIGHT and I'm still losing weight. When I can go in public again I'll take another look at the wine but until then it stays, LOL. And with that it's safe to say that the folks of Vitamix literally made all of my dietary dreams for this year come true. Thank you Cleveland, Ohio & thank you Vitamix!!!

P.S.

other things I've made:

\- nut butter from whole roasted almonds. that one was insane to watch. whole roasted almonds go in, it grinds for like 6 to 7 minutes, and I'm like, ""yep, that's almond butter.""

\- banana & pineapple nice cream (dairy free ice cream made from bananas and w/e else you like, it's gotta have the bananas though)

\- smoothies of every variety, all from whole fruit, seeds, and veggies. I'm actually getting all the vitamins I need from healthy sources and I can feel it. Energy levels feel boundless at times.

\- cashew milk

P.P.S. These things are expensive but they come with a 7 to 10 year warranty and I saw one YouTuber who has a 27 year old Vitamix Blender that his grandmother bought & passed on to him. Fwiw. I consider it an investment in my health.",2020-12-09 07:33:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/k9njcp/on_great_blenders/

itishd,vegetarian,Considering Making Some Changes,"I'm currently an ovo-lacto vegetarian.


I care about the environment and I care about chickens, but (sorry if I'm offending anyone) I don't find it worth my effort to stop eating eggs, because chickens kind of just exist for a while and there isn't a replacement for eggs themselves. I always buy cage-free eggs, no matter what, even though it's not much for them, it's still something. Yes, I'm aware there are replacements for certain egg-containing products such as vegan mayo.


I do believe I should stop consuming dairy because of how bad it is for many reasons, so that decision is pretty much made. I would need a way to express to my guardians in a healthy way why this is important, as my family isn't particularly supportive of these ethical decisions for reasons like cost and my physical health. I need to find a way to properly cope with not consuming dairy too, because cheese is pretty much my favorite thing to eat right now. I've tried vegan cheese and it sucks to be completely honest. Although it is worth mentioning my favorite food I've ever eaten is a certain sushi roll that I thought I would never be able to get off of. I set an exception for once a year on my birthday. Sometime after the first year, I sort of automatically dealt with it and I haven't eaten seafood since.


Where I'm looking to go in a different direction is to go ento. If you're unaware of what an ento diet is, I'll fill you in. An ento diet is eating insects. I know what you're thinking. ""Ew! That's gross! Why on earth would you want to do that?!"" Of course, it's not like I would just eat a spider every time I saw one crawling on the ground. No, no. I would farm my crickets as humanely as possible as well as expand my small mealworm farm. (If anyone's interested, I can start posting the progress on my current mealworm farm for my leopard gecko ""Mango"" on [r/mealworms](https://www.reddit.com/r/mealworms) [r/mealworm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mealworm) and/or [r/leopardgeckos](https://www.reddit.com/r/leopardgeckos)). I would cook them and eat them as snacks, make them as meals, and sneak small amounts into things like smoothies and baked goods. I know while fish is not considered vegetarian, from what I found, (correct me if I'm wrong), insects aren't specifically considered nonvegetarian. I admit I have a sort of hate for some insects such as ants, mosquitoes, etc., however I don't particularly care for or not care for crickets and mealworms. I've been researching the processes of farming certain insects for a while. And I think it would be a good step in the right direction for my overall health as well as something different to try. (I have a minor iron deficiency and I'm underweight on and off).


Let me know your thoughts on these thoughts. I would love some support, criticism, personal views, and scientific sources on every one of these topics if you have any.

ho5ait,vegetarian,Dairy and reversing atherosclerosis,"So I just watched the Netflix documentary [Game Changer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Changers)s, the Joe Rogan [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0zgNY_kqlI)  where one of the producers James Wilkes does an excellent job defending  the documentary against Chris Kressers counter arguments and also a  fact-check [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB0aieRNJs0)  about the documentary from a doctor/PhD and the council member of the  True Health Initiative who specializes in molecular biology, genetics  and nutritional science. As a result I'm going to be seriously  minimizing animal based foods from my diet for the time being and maybe  for good.

Now I know that vegan  diet is the only diet known to reverse atherosclerosis. And this is my  goal as a 30-year old: to reverse atherosclerosis that has probably  started for me already, as for most people, in the early childhood. And  for that to be able to happen I need to minimize saturated fat, dietary  cholesterol and endotoxins from animal products from my diet.

I think this also came up in the documentary but it also comes up in the book of Michael Greger called '[How not to die](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663961-how-not-to-die)'.  In the book Greger points to the fact/hypothesis that it's actually the  endotoxins from animal based foods that hurt our arteries in addition  to LDL. These endotoxins can survive cooking, boiling or going through  stomach acids or digestive enzymes. They are believed to end up in our  bodies with the intake of saturated fats from animal products. After  they end up in our bloodstream they can cause inflammatory reactions in  our arteries and thus increasing the risk for atherosclerosis.

So my question is: **does this apply to dairy products also**?  I regularly drink whey protein drinks for my gym training and I also  eat low fat dairy food like sour cream for my dips and quark for my  smoothies. Sometimes I drink kefir which is also low fat. I don't eat  butter or cheese or drink milk. So basically I'm wondering if it's  possible to reverse atherosclerosis as a lacto-vegetarian?

I found out this randomized crossover trial: [Effects  of low-fat dairy intake on blood pressure, endothelial function, and  lipoprotein lipids in subjects with prehypertension or stage 1  hypertension](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726585/) which concluded the following:

>No  significant effects of consuming low-fat dairy products, compared  with  low-fat nondairy products, were observed for blood pressures,  measures  of vascular function, or lipid variables in the overall sample,  but  results from subgroup analyses were consistent with the hypothesis  that  dairy foods might improve RHI in those with endothelial dysfunction

The  sample size was quite small (62) though but it seems to indicate that  low fat dairy is not bad for your endothelial function.",2020-07-09 15:40:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/ho5ait/dairy_and_reversing_atherosclerosis/

fiick6,vegetarian,How to quarantine yourself with a plant-based lifestyle,"This went over well over at /r/Vegetarianism so I figured I'd share it here too.

The coronavirus pandemic is upon us, and cleaning products, toilet paper, canned goods, etc. are sold out everywhere. If you have to quarantine yourself, here are some tips and tricks to help fulfill the veg ethos during your isolation:

**Toilet Paper Alternatives**

Right now, Amazon is almost entirely sold out of toilet paper. There is a shortage, and it‚Äôs not going to get better soon, since there is a global supply shock for all products.

There are some vegan-friendly brands that still have supply (as of writing this), like Caboo Tree-Free Bamboo Toilet Paper. These options are few and far between.

If you‚Äôre really in a pinch, don‚Äôt be afraid to order some gag gift TP. There are plenty of options on Amazon that are leftovers from Christmas or‚Ä¶ other holidays. Most of these have relatively quick shipping.

The ultimate purchase though, that is actually much more environmentally sustainable over the long term, are bidets. Bidets are small attachments that connect to your toilet‚Äôs water supply and then are placed under the rim of the bowl. You then use a button to spray yourself clean and simply pat dry with toilet paper, saving you a ton of tissue. Bidets are super common in Europe.

Here are some bidets that can be added on as an accessory to your current toilet:

* Via Express Dual Nozzle Toilet Bidet Attachment For Women and Men Cleaning
* Bio Bidet BB-270
* Hibbent Bidet Attachment Non-Electric Mechanical Fresh Water Spray

There are others out there too. Recommendation: get them soon because it seems like supply might be dwindling for these too.

**Surface Disinfectant Alternatives**

Those on a plant-based diet are always having to find creative ways to solve common problems. This is no different with surface disinfectants. This is another product line that is almost **entirely sold out.** Don‚Äôt get gouged by ineffective hand sanitizers (the [CDC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15489352) recommends 60% alcohol) that might brand as kid-friendly or plant-based.

There is a global shortage of hand sanitizer. There is also unfortunately a shortage of handsoap and bleach as well. The CDC says that you can use a diluted bleach solution (1/3 cup of bleach per 1 gallon of water) for disinfecting. Make sure you wear gloves while handling bleach and NEVER mix it with anything except water.

Try searching for sodium hypochlorite - the active ingredient in bleach - you may find products like this one that are aimed toward pool cleaning but can achieve the effect of disinfectants.

Some wipes contain isopropyl alcohol, which is shown to be effective in killing coronaviruses.

There are also forms of hydrogen peroxide out there that will get the job done.

*NOTE: Do NOT use vodka, vinegar, or homemade hand sanitizer, as these are ineffective against the coronavirus.*

**Skin and Face Protection Alternatives**

As you might have noticed, there is a trend. Surgical masks are sold out everywhere too. However, these masks provide a false sense of security. The truth is that most simple masks cannot filter out the coronavirus anyway - its particles are small enough to pass through the mask. Gloves are also ineffective.

*NOTE: Please do not buy masks or gloves. Health professionals need these more than we do.*

**Non-Perishable Food Alternatives**

The good thing about being vegetarian or vegan is that our products can be a bit farther off the beaten path than omnivore foods (see: [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/fibn1o/i_have_enjoyed_that_despite_the_panic_buying_here/) on this subreddit). This means demand for these products is actually a lot lower than for chicken noodle soup or the like, although as that comment thread shows, this might depend on your area. Nevertheless, online supply of veg products is still there for the time being.

Here is a short list of vegan or vegetarian non-perishable or canned foods that can be delivered right to your door:

* Chef Soraya Curry Bowls (vegan)
* Crystal Noodle Soup Pack (vegetarian)
* Loma Linda Fake Meats (vegan)
* NOKA Superfood Smoothie Pouches (vegan)
* Annie‚Äôs Vegan Mac n Cheese (vegan)
* Kashi Crunchy Chocolate Chip Chia Granola Bars (vegan)
* Primal Spirit Vegan Jerky (vegan)

Look out for alternatives to typical staples like almond flour, quinoa, and that sort of thing. Feel free to do some further exploring as to what vegan/vegetarian meals and foods might be available online and let me know if you find something good.

fcivv8,vegetarian,"Easy, practical advice to meeting daily iron requirements as ovo-lacto","I went vegetarian about a year ago and haven't had issues with it besides the fact that I think I might be iron deficient. Reason being is that my beloved thick and slightly wavy hair is now thinner, more frizzy and just seems dead. Skin has also gotten noticeably worse

It makes sense cosidering that when I look at the foods that contain high amounts of iron, I'm not really eating a whole lot of them.

So I thought I'd start incorporating them into my diet. The only problem is that I can't seem to find any practical advice on how to actually reach the amount that I need (from what I gather it's around 15-18 mg but then more because the vegetarian sources are non heme - whatever that means - and are absorbed poorly).

I read all the lists that contain high iron foods. But I feel like it's hard to use that info practically. Like lentils top the lists and is considered a high-iron food because about 200 grams contain \~30% RDA. But who eats 200 grams of lentils in one sitting let alone one day, though? And that's only about 30% RDA. Spinach is another food that's considered high in iron but 100 grams contain 2.7 mg of iron. Great, now I only need 23 mg... I'm not great at maths, but I feel like I'd have to eat nothing but leafy greens, flax seeds, soy beans and nuts from I wake up till I go to bed in order to reach desired amount.

In short: I get that beans, legumes, leafy greens etc, contain high amounts of iron, but does anyone actually have experience putting together realistic and enjoyable meals that are high in iron? I would very much appreciate some advice on that. If those recipes involve fruits, nuts, smoothies etc. I'd be very happy....

Hope someone can help me out. Thanks so much",2020-03-02 20:59:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/fcivv8/easy_practical_advice_to_meeting_daily_iron/

I have been getting bored of my day-to-day food routine and had been on the lookout for new recipes that would taste really good and be really healthful. I use RealPlans to plan my weekly meals and a recipe for Green Apple Pie Smoothies popped up, so I thought I'd give it a try. I am currently drinking it and am blown away by how delicious it is!

For 1 serving:

1/2 green apple1/8 teaspoon fresh ginger1/2 frozen banana1 cup baby spinach3/4 teaspoon honey1/4 teaspoon cinnamon1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg1/4 cup coconut water

Peel, core and chop the apple. Grate the ginger. Combine all ingredients and blend until smooth. Here's a pic (not mine, taken from the RealPlans site though mine looks just like that): [https://i.imgur.com/qQSuBa9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/qQSuBa9.jpg)

I used my Magic Bullet to blend it up, and since 1 serving is 1/2 a banana and 1/2 an apple, I just tossed the other half of the fruit in a second MagicBullet cup, put the lid on it, and tossed it in the freezer for tomorrow. I'm also using a tube of ginger which just makes my life easier and cuts down on waste (I tend not to use whole ginger quickly enough). If you want to make it richer, you could easily add some coconut milk (though that would make the calorie/fat content higher, of course).

This really tastes like apple pie. I'm blown away. Super tasty!

I drink protein shakes and smoothies daily, and my meals include a good balance of carbs and protein. I lift consistently, I do glute-focused workouts, and I always activate before training. I‚Äôve done all the usual stuff: hip thrusts, RDLs, Bulgarian split squats, glute bridges, cable kickbacks‚Ä¶ you name it.

Is there anything not commonly talked about that helped YOU grow that upper glute shelf? I‚Äôm open to creative or advanced strategies‚Äîexercises, training splits, frequency, recovery tips‚Äîwhatever. I just feel like I‚Äôve hit a wall and need a fresh approach.

1jejezg,bodyweightfitness,"Trying to lose weight while building up muscles, what is the best method?","Some background first:  
I am about 40 years old, 6ft tall and weigh about 200 pounds. I am out of shape with no real defined muscle. However, I don't look really overweight. My goal is to lose weight and build up defined muscles in my arms and abdomen.

My target weight (not figuring in muscle increase) is about 180 pounds. Anything less than that and I look too skinny.



I know that in order to lose weight you need to be on a calorie deficit. Which I am on (I lost 10 pounds over the last two months). But I also want to build up muscles.

For my muscle build-up. I need to limit myself to workouts that I can do in my office easily. So I got the TRX system and I have some dumbells. Technically I can get a small treadmill or similar machine, I just don't have a shower in the office so would need to do it at end of the day.



The question is, do I focus on the calorie deficit mainly while doing the exercises, and only later try focusing on increased protein for bulking up. Or as long as I am doing the exercises, I should be increasing my protein via smoothies, etc...¬†

Also, besides the TRX what other exercises should I do?

Thank you¬†

1cvro8l,bodyweightfitness,How can I have more energy in morning workouts?,"Hi guys,

So, I recently decided to try working out in the morning since when coming back from work I feel extremely exhausted. Since I started, I tried to drink whey protein and some fruit (like strawberry or blueberry) smoothies before working out, but when I hit the gym I don't have the same energy and I feel very nauseated with the smoothie that I just drank. 

I would like some advice on how I can have some energy for my morning workouts and if I should try doing fasting workouts. Or if you have any golden advice for morning workouts, I would really appreciate it.

Thank you!

Edit: I choose to wake up at 5:30 am, I arrive home at 7:20 am to prepare to go to work. I didn't adjust my sleep to my new schedule yet.
Since I am still adjusting myself to this new schedule, should I take it easy on my exercise until i start hitting the gym hard?",2024-05-19 16:04:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1cvro8l/how_can_i_have_more_energy_in_morning_workouts/
1cp4ztc,bodyweightfitness,How to build and maintain muscle mass overtime? ,"Hey guys, hope you‚Äôre doing well tonight, I wanted to ask for a bit of advice in regards to fitness. 

So, I‚Äôm 22, and male, and I think I already live quite a healthy lifestyle. I‚Äôve recently been reducing sugar intake, and I‚Äôve been eating more things like rice and black beans lately (they‚Äôre so tasty cooked Brazilian style). 

I like drinking smoothies and snacking on fruit, eating seafood, I try to incorporate meat in my diet and I‚Äôve recently started snacking on red peppers and green olives instead of cookies for one thing. I cook like all my meals myself so everything is always super fresh. I eat things like pasta and salad as well. Oh I also drank a lot of milk growing up haha I don‚Äôt know if that makes a difference lol.

I‚Äôm quite an active person, walking around 8-11 km a day/5-9 miles a day. I try my best to get 8-9 hours of sleep, I wear sunscreen, I don‚Äôt smoke or drink do any drugs.

However I have recently been seeing some content online about age related muscle loss which inspired me to get even more physically active. I want to stay strong and fit forever or as much as I can, which I think is totally possible with the right lifestyle. My inspiration to exercise is more about health than looks (although those are cool too üëå üòé)

When I was a teenager I worked out way more. I didn‚Äôt use any type of equipment and I did various body weight exercises, like pushups and squats and would even do like 500 squats after awhile. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve retained muscle from that.

Is there any way I can build and maintain more muscle without having to go to the gym or lift weights?

Like most people, I‚Äôd rather get my exercise from walking and sports and dancing then do workouts, in the gym or at home.

However I am super willing and interested in putting in the effort to do good for my body, so I‚Äôm down to exercise again!!

I am so down to start doing a routine of pushups and squats and planks again, along with other ab exercises and cardio workouts like jumping jacks, however I want to ask is that enough combined with other good lifestyle choices as I mentioned before? I know some activity is better than none.

I don‚Äôt want to get bulky at all, I really just want to build and maintain a good / healthy level of muscle. 

Let‚Äôs say I start doing home workouts, and get to a high level of reps and sets. Is it alright if I keep doing those same levels after some time? 

Will it‚Äîand being active in other ways, like walking‚Äîbe enough for me to maintain my muscle and overall shape if I have a good diet to go with it?

I figured it would be a good way to stay as the same body mass overtime but I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure.

I‚Äôd ask a personal trainer for advice but I‚Äôm just as broke as anyone else out there üòµ‚Äçüí´

If you are someone who‚Äôs more experienced in the gym than me or have any of your own stories to share, I would soo appreciate your advice üôè",2024-05-11 00:44:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1cp4ztc/how_to_build_and_maintain_muscle_mass_overtime/

t9spvv,bodyweightfitness,[Need rec] for unflavored protein supplement,"Hi all, 

Recently started tracking macros more seriously, and found out (to no surprise) I need to boost my protein intake to reach my goals. 

I've just been using up some old protein powder from before, but am starting to run out and thought it might be a good time to find one that I can enjoy a bit more. So the cheaper ones and more readily available options off the shelf seem to always come in flavored packages (usually vanilla/choco/peanut butter)

While cost is still a consideration, I'd like to have one that is not artificially flavoured/sweetened since I mix my own smoothie with fruits and the like. I know that it'll probably have some whey taste or whatever, but that's acceptable (I know it's hard for anything to be completely unflavored, and probably unappealing anyways)


I have no dietary restrictions, so I'm open to any and all suggestions, and don't mind if the suggestion is vegan or whatever either. 
I'm located in the Canadian PNW, and would appreciate if it's something I can just grab off the shelf from a store, but I don't mind buying online either as long as shipping isn't exorbitant.

Anyhoo, thanks in advance everyone!",2022-03-08 22:32:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/t9spvv/need_rec_for_unflavored_protein_supplement/
sm9u41,bodyweightfitness,Final Plan to Gain Weight! Any advice?,"Hello, everyone! It is me again. Seeking more advice because I am planning to start on doing my plan. My year end goal is to get from 45 kg to 60 kg (or somewhere near that) and do 15 full push ups (and maybe 10 pull ups as well) after 3 months and feel stronger. My other sub goals are get bigger arms, bigger butt, and stronger grip. 

I am a 20 year old female who weighs 45 kg (since 7th grade lol) and 5'2 tall. I haven't been working out for a year now and have been extremely sedentary. 

According to the calculator I used my TDEE is around 1,367. I want to gain weight so I would do some calorie surplus and based from my previous posts and from the comments of other redditors it is better to start small than add 1,000+cals to my TDEE so I am planning to add increments of 350 cals to my TDEE every 2 weeks (or should I do it weekly?) and use MyFitnessPal app then see how it goes from there and do necessary adjustments if needed. I'm asian so rice a really part of my everyday meals. I also just set an eating time for myself which are 7:00 am (breakfast), 10:00 am (snack), 1:00 pm (lunch), 4:00 pm (snack), and 7:00 pm (dinner). I'm planning to drink some fruit calorie smoothie every breakfast before workout and before dinner. Is that advisable? For breakfast, is it recommended to eat some rice meal? 

For the workout program I would use the bodyweight RR since it's a beginner program (and it's 3 times a week) and I don't have any equipment aside from the resistance bands I have + I can't really go to the gym because the high cases of COVID in my country. I would probably use DIY weights too. I would eat breakfast + smoothie at 7 am and workout at 8 am then just drink water when I'm taking a break. 

Some people has mentioned that I might have confused my BMR with my TDEE but I didn't as I have been extremely sedentary. Someone also mentioned that reaching 60kg healthily isn't really attainable in a year specially when the person starts at 45 kg although maybe gaining 1kg per month is doable and attainable. Reaching 60kg or somewhere near that IS still my goal but yeah gaining 1kg per month would be okay for me since I would just add 350 cals to my TDEE. Do you think I should change up my approach to my diet or workout? 

Anyway, this would be the last post I will make then just take your advice or recommendations then implement them into my routine. Again, any criticism, suggestion, or advice is welcome! I would appreciate it. Thank you!",2022-02-06 22:40:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/sm9u41/final_plan_to_gain_weight_any_advice/

kxte0k,bodyweightfitness,"One year update! (~185 to 141lbs) M/28/5'5""- Strength training every other day with gentle cardio most days, tracking macros and nutrition carefully and totally life changed!","Hi all,

I'm super happy and proud to say I'm one year in to my fitness journey which all started here! I'm almost 150 workouts in and can't believe how much my fitness level and strength has changed since then. A massive thanks to all those on the sub who helped me start out, gave me tips and allowed me to keep up the effort. I've come a long way since starting bodyweight exercise, and while I've progressed to using some gym equipment I have still *never* set foot in a gym. It can all be done at home, honest!

My current workout routine is still every two days - which usually works out around 2-3 (sometimes 4) times a week which gives me plenty of time to rest inbetween and get my good 8 hours sleep. Most days I walk the dog as a form of cardio, and my wife and I have recently invested in a treadmill for when the weather's too poor. A quick 30-40 min walk at lunchtime on that makes me feel a lot better and gets some gentle cardio in to my routine.  My mental health has improved immensely and I'm still keen to keep mixing it up and seeing how I can work toward a higher level of strength and fitness, it's a great way to give me routine and cure my anxiety, especially during COVID.

As a bit of background - I began dieting late 2019 but started strength training properly in Jan 2020.

**Current**

Jan '21 - 141lbs or 64kg ([Current Progress](https://imgur.com/a/3tuYDAp))

My big change for 2021 is to start building on my strength base. I've upped my caloric intake whilst keeping a real close eye on my nutrition, and I think it's really helping. I'm happy with my appearance and fitness currently, but I'm working on increasing my strength and technique.

**Exercise Routine**

It's been a full year since I started with the RR, and it was 90% bodyweight exercises then. I was looking for a home workout with minimal equipment, and that worked exactly as I hoped. Since then I've moved home and now have much more space to add equipment, which gives me some extra challenges. I still make sure to keep my bodyweight exercises within the routine.

My current equipment consists of a pull-up bar, pair of dumbbells and recently a kettlebell to increase my options. I use furniture around the house to assist, but being in the UK not many houses are particular well suited to hanging rings from the ceiling, etc, especially my one!

I always aim to do a routine every other day. On good weeks I can get 3-4 workouts done, but as long as I manage to squeeze in two sessions I see that as a win. I don't let it interfere with my personal life, but as I work from home I can quite often find an hour or two to fit it in. I also do a lot of dog walking to contribute with some gentle cardio.

I currently just have the one routine fresh for 2021, trying out new things but I'm hoping to create an alternate second routine to fill in the gaps;

Routine 1:

* Hip Raises (3 x 9)
* Hanging leg raises (3 x 8)
* Push-ups (3 x 15)
* Side Plank ( 3 x 35s)
* Pull-ups (3 x 8)
* Y-T-I Raises (3 x 9)
* Tricep Extensions (Dumbbell) (3 x 9 @ 9 kg)
* Bench Press (Dumbbell) (3 x 15 @ 9 kg)
* Bicep/Hammer Curl (3 x 11 @ 9 kg)
* Woodchop (3 x 14 @ 12 kg)
* Weighted Crunches (4 x 15 @ 12 kg)
* Kettlebell Rows (3 x 8 @ 20 kg)
* Goblet Squats (3 x 10 @ 20 kg)

I feel like I can really see the progressive overload happening already this year. I'm definitely more easily able to up my reps with subsequent workouts, without impacting the rest of my routine. Heavier weights and more sets have been challenging but focussing on form really helps me manage the extra strain.

I recommend the free app 'Strong' to track workouts I take around 30-45 second breaks between sets, and the routine takes around 1hr 15 min - 1hr 30 mins including a short warm-up and dependent on if I have to take a work call!

**Diet**

I've upped my calories significantly for the time being. I'm on around 2700 cals per day consisting of almost entirely healthy, nutritious options, or as close as I can. It's been useful during lockdown as there are little temptations when socialising!

* Breakfast - Overnight oats with seeds, peanut butter, greek yoghurt, etc.
* Lunch - Eggs, low fat sausages, high protein cheese, beans, salad
* Dinner - Smoky bean chilli, curries, or other lean meat meals (usually beef, pork, chicken or prawns) with a smaller portion of carbs (pasta, small wraps, rice), many veggies (carrots, green beans, onion, mushrooms, butternut squash, peppers), salad. Mixing in more carbs recently too.
* Snacks - Greek/icelandic style yoghurt, fruit smoothies, almonds, protein shakes (1 a day with milk)

When I was losing weight I was ensuring I was in a calorie deficit, somewhere between 1700-1900 cals a day. I'm quite short so my calories tend to be on the lower side. Tons of protein and much lower carbs and fats while losing weight.

I slowly ramped this up toward the end of last year with a view to stabilising my weight, and eventually I settled on around 2200-2300 as an approximately maintainence value with my level of activity. It took a good month to really work this out.

I then slowly upped my calories til I saw the scales start to move. It's early days but I think my target of 2700 is about right for now. Just going to keep checking daily and average out my rate of weight change, to see if I'm around the right figure.

For those who are interested I use this to work out my TDEE: [BMR Calculator](https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/).

I try to avoid chocolate, cakes, or other processed snacks. We cook from scratch for almost everything, which is great as I can completely control what goes in. We barely use any oil for cooking and our meals are still super tasty without the need for extra fats from oils or dressings.

**Plan moving forward**

I'm enjoying the progress I've seen in January already. I'm keeping a close eye on my reps and tracking my progress, as well as my weigh-ins daily to ensure my rate of weight gain doesn't go much above 0.5-1.0lb a week - I don't want to spoil any progress I've made to burn off the fat.

I'd really love some suggestions for a second routine to fill in the gaps. I'm currently thinking of re-introducing the Front Lever back into my routine, as well as some more leg exercises. Any suggestions on good uses of heavy kettlebells too? I've bought an extremely large 20kg sand/cement kettlebell which is great for squats and rows, but not very appropriate for swings or other single handed exercises.

Wishing you all the best for 2021 in your fitness journeys and I hope I can help people just starting out as I did a full year ago! My advice is stick with it and make time to fit it in - and don't panic if you miss a workout or two! Every little helps and you've still got to live!

N.B. I'm not personal trainer or nutritionist, but if you'd like some honest opinions or have any questions feel free to drop me a message! I hope I can help.",2021-01-15 12:14:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kxte0k/one_year_update_185_to_141lbs_m2855_strength/
kjo00m,bodyweightfitness,Six months ago I found r/BWF and calisthenics - wanted to share my progress! (32/M),"**TL;DR:** Lost 10 lbs. Pullups went from 3x2 to 10x8. Dips went from 3x5 to 10x8 (+35lbs). Push ups from 10 max to 30+. Got off of CBD for anxiety. Fell in love with calisthenics.

Before/After Pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/vzAQ3kl](https://imgur.com/a/vzAQ3kl)

Hey BWF! As the year winds down, I wanted to share my short journey in calisthenics so far. In 2018 I had surgery to repair a torn ACL/MCL/LCL/meniscus (skateboarding). The recovery went terribly as I ended up with a blood clot in my calf after surgery. It led to me not properly rehabbing my leg.

Fast forward to June 2020 and I have just re-injured my ankle for to 100th time since surgery. I vowed right then to get myself back in shape...I'm 32, my body can't be on the decline yet. Only problem is, I hate the gym. I like sports, and the gym never felt like that.

As we've all gathered, I then found BWF. It was a game changer. I loved how it reminded me of skateboarding (tricks, self motivated, working with groups). I met with my physio and made a plan. Three months later he deemed my knee fully recovered. But I was hooked.

I started working out with an acquaintance (now good friend) every second day at a local park. Jump ahead another 3 months and here we are. After 6 months of consistent work and eating well (major factor), I feel better than I ever have. I stopped having to use CBD to manage anxiety, I haven't had any major injury setbacks and have never looked/felt better.

**Some stats (Before | After):**

Push Ups - 3x10 | 5x15 (+35lbs)

Pull Ups - 3x2 | 10x8

Dips - 3x5 | 10x8 (+35lbs)

L Sit - 5 sec | 30 sec+

**My Program:**

I played with so many different routines over the 6 months, watched/read everything on calisthenics I could. My average workout these days is always full body with two push, two pull, a leg circuit, ab circuit and multiple skill add ons (hand stand, lever training, false grip training etc.). Usually takes me about 1 hour and 45 min. I train every second day.

**My Diet:**

I eat plant based. Lots of fruits, smoothie bowls, rice bowls, salads etc. I supplement vegan protein, creatine, glutamine, BCAAs, B12, vitamin D etc. I ate at a deficit for the whole 6 months. Ranged between 1800-2800 calories a day.

**Some Last Thoughts:**

Calisthenics has been such an amazing addition to my life. If you're on the fence about getting into it - please, do yourself a favour. It's challenging, rewarding, and really fun once you're over the habit hump.

Big love to the whole community. Hannibal 4 King!

EDIT: A lot of people asking about how I fit in so many sets. I don‚Äôt do my maxes every workout, I stack workouts, do ab/leg circuits and often go for two hours. 

Also, I made huge jumps in strength because I was at a deficit after injury. My before numbers were a bit deflated.

Here‚Äôs the thing,
I worked out for one week straight (well on MWF, one hour of strength, one hour of basketball) and I was waking up earlier than I needed to actually care for myself (full shower/hair style actually put on an outfit instead of ‚Äúbummy‚Äù clothes.) for breakfast I would make these delicious uplifting smoothies with ginger in it for breakfast, go to class, work out after or come home and have another smoothie and would eat a small dinner. Squeezing in homework, house duties, and care for the fur children.
The only ‚Äòfree time‚Äô I had I used to do something that was needed.

I haven‚Äôt felt that uplifting in a long time (athlete all through my younger life until after high school) and I also have a few medical issues that usually make me feel like shit but I felt great. 

The thing is, I get 4-6 hours of sleep. If I get more, I sleep through my alarms and will literally sleep most of the day, and if I sleep less cranky and exhausted. With working out, it has to be 6 hours for my body to do some proper healing.

With that being said, I got behind on homework, on cleaning the house & laundry. I‚Äôve spent the last 3 weeks trying to catch up. HW will be caught up today but half the house is still behind.

Ofcourse in the meantime I stopped making smoothies, stop waking up early, etc.
Also, in that week I lost 3 pounds. Great!! (As I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve gained it back :( )

How do you fit everything in?? How do you balance it out??

dsl6v6,bodyweightfitness,Tips on Increasing Reps for Weighted Chin Ups?,"I‚Äôve steadily been increasing my weighted chin ups over the last 5 weeks, but my progress is starting to stall. I was wondering if anyone had any advice.

To increase my strength, my goal has been to do 3 sets of 5 reps with a rest of 2 minutes, adding 5 more pounds at the start of every week. I do this workout 3 times a week as part of a routine that‚Äôs pretty similar to the RR, and I do my chin ups first since it‚Äôs the exercise I want to advance the most in. At every weight I‚Äôve attempted so far, I‚Äôve consistently been able to do 5 reps on the first set, 4 to 5 on the second set, and usually 4 to 3 on the third set. To make up for the lost reps on my last set, I‚Äôll immediately strip all the weight, and do regular chin ups to failure (the first two weeks I could only do about 2 or 3 more, but now I‚Äôm up to about 4 to 6).

This has been working really well for me up until now. I went from only being able to do 20 pounds my first week, to hitting the same numbers with 40 pounds with 6 extra bodyweight chins ups at the end. This has all been with very strict form (no kicking or momentum cheating, hang with engaged shoulders at the bottom, and with my chin to or over the bar each time). However, this week, I‚Äôve been struggling to move up to 45 pounds. On Monday, I could only do 3 reps on the first set, 2 on the second, and 2 on the last set followed by a superset of 6 extra bodyweight chin ups.

In your experience, what is the best way to overcome a plateau like this?

I figured it might be best to go back to basics. When you‚Äôre first learning to do chin ups, you do negatives ‚Äì so today I did 3 reps with 45 pounds, followed by 2 negatives with the belt still on, then 2 reps and 3 negatives, then 1 rep, 4 negatives, and 2 bodyweight chin ups to finish. I also did 5 bodyweight chin ups as a warm up, instead of jumping right into it like I have in the past, and I added a bowl of oatmeal to my regular breakfast to give myself some extra calories to burn. Even so, I‚Äôm not sure if negatives are as effective as alternatives such as dropping the weight and aiming for higher reps/more sets, adding in some curls afterwards, doing some forearm strength work, etc. Any guidance would be appreciated.

Some other stuff about me that might be relevant ‚Äì I‚Äôm male, in my early 20s, 6 foot, and weigh about 175 pounds. I sleep 7 to 8 hours each night. About an hour before I do the workout, I have 3 eggs, 2 pieces of turkey bacon, a fruit smoothie, and I drink about 20 oz of water (sometimes add a coffee if I didn‚Äôt sleep well). When I‚Äôm done working out, I always have a protein shake. The rest of the day, I keep my diet as strict as I can, making sure to eat plenty of good stuff like chicken, salmon, pork, steak, mixed vegetables, and cauliflower rice. I haven‚Äôt calculated it recently, but I would estimate I come in at about 2000-2500 calories a day, getting at least 180 grams of protein. I also run about 3 miles 3 days a week between a 7 to 8 minute pace, and box for an hour to two hours 5 days a week. Both of those workouts always come after any weighted calisthenic work so I'm not too tired to push weight.",2019-11-06 19:24:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/dsl6v6/tips_on_increasing_reps_for_weighted_chin_ups/

abfu3p,bodyweightfitness,Calisthenics 1 year Progress,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôm 17 years old, 5‚Äù8, 145lb.

I‚Äôm making this post to show you what I achieved in 1 year of consistent calisthenics training. I started on January 1st of 2018 and have been going hard since! My main goals were to gain weight, learn skill moves (planche most importantly), increase pull-up reps, and climb my way up the BW ladder. 
Before this year I was still pretty active but never was consistent with training and mainly did endurance stuff.

Here are some of the things I accomplished this year from most important to least (according to my goals)

- 5 freestanding HSPUs

- lean bulked to 10 pounds of muscle (135lb - 145lb) 

- 5 second straddle planche

- 30 pull-ups

- strict muscle ups 

- learned how to handstand (max 60 second hold)

- harder variations of push-ups including archers, triple clap, typewriter, and one arm

- weighted everything from pull-ups, dips and push-ups (50lb pull-ups for reps and same for dips)

- Overall much more muscular and broader shoulders!


Some extra stuff to add: I started officially training for the front lever just a couple months ago. Before that I was focusing more purely on my planche.
 After I hit 40 pull-ups I will start training for the one arm pull-up. Im focusing a lot on pull-up reps because I am trying to break a record at my school. 
I learned so much this year on fitness and how to train your body smarter and healthier. 

As far as my diet it‚Äôs really simple, from day 1 I cut out all processed foods and sugars. I eat real Whole Foods now and do 3 meals a day along with 2 protein shakes and sometimes smoothies. I eat a lot of veggies and chicken.....too much chicken.

If you have any questions please ask! I don‚Äôt want to make this post too long but if anyone wants I‚Äôd be happy to post my current routine or the ones I started with back in January! 

Thanks for reading :)

8nif8i,bodyweightfitness,Is it natural to want to puke after a tough group exercise?,"The exercise was 8-9 am.

In the morning, I had one tablespoon of sole (water and Himalayan salt), a shot of espresso, some water with aloe Vera juice, and after brushing my teeth I gulped a little squirt of Charlotte‚Äôs Web Hemp Extract oil.

The workout was upper body focused. We did jumping jacks, squats, left to rights (idk what it‚Äôs called but you cross one leg behind the other and it looks like a side lunge almost), jump squats, burpees and like one other thing for a couple sets.

The workouts were: 45 sec bench press (with partners, the break was push ups) for two sets, followed by knee tucks on a medicine ball (or push up stance with opposing knee crossing to touch elbow), followed by standing isolated dumbbell push presses (with the non-workout hand held overhead) for three reps per arm), follows by I think inch worms, then we did a few more workouts like abduction-oriented battle rope movements, lateral raises with the non-alternated arm held out like a t, etc.

Near the end of the workout I was definitely going slow. I‚Äôm used to at-your-own-pace workouts and have some stomach issues as is. I was seeing a couple spots at the end and was wondering if anybody who‚Äôs ever crept near passing out knows what I‚Äôm talking about.

I‚Äôm at the cafe nearby right now and as soon as I sipped on my smoothie I had this wave of nausea hit me. That‚Äôs after a half hour. I‚Äôm chipping away at it now, but was wondering if it‚Äôs natural to feel like puking after an exercise, especially when you‚Äôre trying to eat breakfast immediately afterwards.

I know I can tweak my approach, I just literally do workouts, followed by work and class, or workout at the end of the day if I was too tired in the AM.

5pmhrd,bodyweightfitness,Caloric Surplus: Smoothies,"I have had a really hard time eating to surplus in a healthy way. I tried eating nuts throughout the day but found that I just ate less during meals (I felt physical revulsion to eating that much.)

Steven Low recommended drinking surplus calories. I assume he meant smoothies. Basically, a relatively healthy high calorie smoothie consists of: whole milk (8oz), 1 scoop whey protein, and some flavoring (fruit, peanut butter, even chocolate.)

For the last couple of days, I've been drinking a smoothie after dinner. I found I eat the same amount during the day and I can stomach the smoothie pretty well (the volume of liquid causes some discomfort, but it subsides quickly as the body absorbs it.) Plus, it's easy to measure as I eat normally (maintenance) and just add a smoothie with the surplus I need.

The downside is you need a fridge to keep all the milk cold and blender/food processor and be willing to wash everything afterwards. :) I do 1 banana, 4 frozen strawberries, 8 oz whole milk, 1 scoop whey for about 500 calories.

If you really want to pack the calories add 4 oz of some high fat drink: coconut milk or even heavy cream (adds about another 400 calories!)

Thanks /u/eshlow! I hope this helps other people who are bulking but having a hard time eating that much. This may be obvious to others but for some reason it never occurred to me. It should have been obvious since so many people who are cutting talk about accidentally drinking surplus calories. :)

5gilvg,bodyweightfitness,My progress after a couple of months with RR and some questions.,"Hi, 

I've been doing the recommended routine for a couple of months now. To be exact, since start of September till now. 

Just today I did my latest workout. This is my how far I've become. 

Shoulder rolls, Scapular Shrugs, Camel Bends. Usually do between 5-10... And then 5 of each front/side leg swings.

Honestly I've been skipping the other warmup exercises the last month as I really don't find them necessary and they're just taking up my time. Thoughts? 

1 min of normal plank, each side, reverse plank, hollow hold and arch. 

3x45s of wall plank 

Just started on parallel bar support (1x60 sec on rings) as I just got my new rings!! I went down to 2x45 on Wall plank now that I can do this.. Thoughts? 

3x5 pull-ups 

3x3 ring dips 

3x8 deep step ups 

3x30s one leg L-sit 

3x5 wide ring push-ups (came from 3x10 declined Diamond push-ups) 

Before today I did 3x8 rows under my table, but now I got rings I tried tuck front lever. I just couldn't do a single hold... Not sure if my muscles needs to get used to rings or what to do here.. 

I'm pretty proud of my progression even though it's nothing big yet. I only got my pull up bar ~2 weeks ago and my rings yesterday so.. Haven't been able to do dips and Pullups until recently. Just happy I could pull myself together to keep doing this. I really hope I won't give up anytime soon. 

I've a couple of questions that I've been thinking about for a long time now.. I hope some of you gurus can chime in.. 

* overall thoughts on my progress - is anything lacking behind? 

* How to progress with rows now that I got my rings, tuck front lever are super hard and I feel like I can't do them yet..maybe I'm just doing them wrong. But I would appreciate some kind of exercise on my rings rather than under my table which was kind of a hassle. 

* I know you're supposed to do the exercises in pairs, but I really prefer just to do one exercise, finish it completely and then move on. Does this matter a lot? For example, doing 3xpushups and then 3xrows instead of one set of each. 

* I started on 60kg/175cm and I'm almost at 70kg now. I think I'd like to hit 75kg, how does that sound? Maybe a bit much, but I still feel too small. I gained the first 7kg super fast(within 40 days) and now I've been taking 50 days to get the last 2 kg.. Im having a hard time to hit my daily intake. Not the best appetite... 

* just added whey protein - 1: should I take it after workout or just before bed? 2: is this overkill? I get ~70g peanut butter every morning in my smoothie

I feel like I have so many questions while exercising but I keep forgetting them.. Maybe I'll edit some in :-) cheers, thanks for reading.. 

Also a huge thanks to /u/4UIHV882 for keeping me motivated and helping me with my initial questions regarding bodyweight fitness!! ",2016-12-04 23:53:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5gilvg/my_progress_after_a_couple_of_months_with_rr_and/

I'm considering to stop eating eggs, oatmel and all that for breakfast. The reason is that I want to start my day with a fresh smoothie, because I find it easier to digest, and quicker to prepare.

I've been thinking about a smoothie containing the following things:
- 2 big bananas (350gr of bananas)
- a handful of spinach
- 50gr of raw oats
- water.

According to cronometer.com, this smoothie has 15gr of protein, 110 gr of carbs and 8 gr of fat.

By the way, my diet goals are muscle gain.

Also... what do you think about adding some seeds or lentils to my smoothie? Hahah

4jiyu3,bodyweightfitness,"Progress pics. 5'10"" 150lbs Bonus: Pectus Excavatum","EDIT: some before pictures in August and December . [ http://imgur.com/a/Iypz4]( http://imgur.com/a/Iypz4)

Hi all! Sorry fort shoddy Pic quality and general PO'ed look. Just went through some shit and did a rather intense workout to blow off steam.

[Link](http://imgur.com/a/S4yIw)

Background:
Used to be 120 pound bordering the anorexia line kid back in September. Was in the Chihuahuan desert for 2 weeks and did a lot of thinking. Came back and made some major life changes. Broke it off with my long term SO, started gaining weight, getting fit, becoming healthier, and just focusing on being happy. Can say I am definitely happier in my current state. Received my first compliments on my body ever the other day. Weird to me because no matter my weight I still see this 120 pound kid with skinny AF arms. Feels good man.

Workout: All body weight routines. Fits into my schedule better and I can bring my workout partner - the golden doodle - to the park with me. I do add weights for difficulty on occasion, just depends on the day. Last workout was 3X8 sets of Pullups, dips, and pushups with 65 pounds of weight. 3X5-8 sets of HSPU's and 3x30s hanging L-Sits, with martial arts cardio in between sets. Also took up sprinting with my dog the other day and am in pain, but oddly love it.

Future: Just started training for planches. Can hold the frog pose for over 30 seconds at a time. Just when I stick a leg out I collapse within 5 seconds, but I'm only on day 3 so i'm happy with it.

Also started up training for One Armed pull ups. Can hold onto the meat of my forearm and crank out around 3-4 on each side at the moment. Able to get about 3/4 of the way there while holding onto my bicep. Fun times!

Diet: Most vegetarian. Probably chicken or dish once a week, but no red meat or pork. I don't watch my calories anymore, I just know what my food generally has has and take a liquid smoothie every bulking day. I typically bulk 1 week on 1 week off. Seems to work pretty well for me.

Note on Pectus Excavatum: That would be the dent in my chest. Never had issues, other than when Im coughing hard, and always played sports without a problem. Only downside at this point is that it causes my chest to not be as pronounced as others of similar mass. Hell IDGAF though. I use the damn thing as a snack bowl.

Would love pointers, encouragement, or aesthetic direction. Im the only seeing my body naked ATM, and am biased. I still see myself as I was in September despite the weight and strength gains.

Thanks all.",2016-05-16 01:17:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4jiyu3/progress_pics_510_150lbs_bonus_pectus_excavatum/
4coa7m,bodyweightfitness,3 Weeks In! Some Questions from a Newbie,"Hi r/BodyWeightFitness,

Thank you for existing! This community is so focused and supportive, I really enjoy it. I've been performing the Recommended Routine for almost 3 weeks, and I have already felt healthier and more grounded. I'm posting now as a bit of a reflection for myself, and also hoping that I might get some help with questions I've been having.

I made a simple workout log so I could track and share my progress, you can see it  [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HGwro9mFvVU_AYG3kSWUF-uE-Qg1SnH-ZHJiLv3tHd0/edit?usp=sharing) (if you want to try it here is a [blank copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zm10jNEmEi-ltWZZRwjSOwEgIvu-ggDUHW6XWq1xeHA/edit?usp=sharing))

Here is what I've been doing:

* I do my workout in the evenings for about an hour, Monday/Wednesday/Friday.
* I swim laps on Tuesday/Thursday (Casually, last time I went I swam about 500 meters, though I am trying to inch it up a bit each visit and improve my form)
* I've added a Vega protein smoothie with milk or almond-milk in the morning (I usually eat very little for breakfast so this is more than I usually have in the morning), and cut a lot of casual sugar consumption and eating-out from my weekdays. 
* Apart from the smoothies and cooking more, I have decided not to worry too much about how much I eat - fat loss and muscle gains are both attractive to me. I'm focusing on keeping a routine for a month or three before micromanaging my diet.

Here is some of what I've been doing and my sticking points:

* **Warmups**: I think I have these down!
* **Bodyline Work - Plank and Side Plank**: I have a much harder time doing plank from my elbows, and by the end of the minute my lower back sags and I feel its really sloppy. Should I continue to try to make the minute even if I'm sloppy, or should I do it only as long as I can keep good form?
* **Bodyline Work - Hollow Hold**: My back arches off of the ground and it is very, very hard for me to prevent it from doing so. Bending/raising my legs helps, but I worry makes the exercise worthless. Right now I sort of struggle with really mediocre form, adjusting to try to keep my upper back from contacting the mat. Any tips, or is there a progression that might help me work up to a proper Hollow Hold? *I found Antanik's [hollow hold video](http://antranik.org/hollow-body-position-importance/) which includes some tips and a very helpful progression!*
* **Skill Work - Handstands**: I can barely hold a wall handstand for 45s. I feel like my progress here is so slow I'll never reach 5 minutes, let alone 10, or ever inch closer to the wall. My hips totally sag. Should I be doing something else? Is this ok at this point?
* **Skill Work - Support**: Similar to the handstands, except I have found in my apartment the only place to do dips is between two chairs - and man is it hard!Also, the chairbacks dig into my hands and hurt pretty fiercely. Will this go away, or am I hurting my hands??
* **Squat-Jumps**: These are going fine, I've been adding one per workout and once I hit 20 I plan to start doing burpess instead, starting over at 10. 
* **Strength Work - Rest Length**: I started with the 90s breaks, but I read in one of the threads here that 90 seconds is too short. Since then I've tried between 2 and 3 minutes, which does make the workout quite a bit longer. Any recommendations on what the ""ideal"" rest should be?
* **Srength Work - Rest Frequency**: I have been resting between each set during each pair, so I will do pushups-rest-rows-rest etc. Is this right, or am I supposed to do pushups-rows-rest? I'm just unclear on this, maybe because my workout is inching to 1.5 hours and I'm feeling like thats a long time. 
* **Strength Work - Pullups and Dips**: My form on negative pullups gets quite sloppy by the end, and I've been doing foot/toe assisted dips between my two chairs, which are just a total mess. I can't even do 1 unassisted dip without worming like crazy (and almost falling over). It said to skip these until I can do diamond pushups, but it seems like I need to practice them or I'll never get better... so I'm torn. should I just skip them for now or keep doing them?
* **Strength Work - Step-ups**: These are not very challenging for me on the highest stable surface I can step onto in my apartment (~19inches). Would picking up a kettle bell or some free weights and performing weighted squats be better, or should I seek out a 24"" platform to step up to?
* **Strength Work - L-Sits**: I am most proud of how quickly my body adapted to this surprisingly horrible feeling exercise. Unfortunately my form with the one-foot supported l-sit gets very sloppy at the end of the sets, mostly my butt inches forward. Should I just stop instead of pushing through if I can't maintain form?

That is already more than 99% of people will slog through, so I'll stop there. Answer some questions, or just 1, and I'll be grateful! Thank you all for reading and providing such a great community, I've learned a lot from browsing this forum. 

**Edit**: I've added answers I've found to my own questions in *italics*. Sometimes it takes asking a question to seriously search for it yourself, I suppose, but maybe my post here will help someone else stumbling around with questions.",2016-03-31 03:19:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4coa7m/3_weeks_in_some_questions_from_a_newbie/
3sgq70,bodyweightfitness,How to gain more weight when bulking with Calisthenics,"Hey BWF family! I haven't posted anything on here for quite some time but I still lurk occasionally. I wanted to talk to you guys about one of my greatest obstacles when it comes to building muscles, and that's eating enough.


I've never really been a big eater. Sure every now and again I would eat an entire pizza by myself but for the most part my intake stayed around the low-mid 2,000 range. Problem is, I need to be eating closer to 3,000+ to reach my goals. At first this was very hard for me, but overtime I have found ways to get those calories in, without feeling like I'm gorging myself. Here are my top 3 tips on eating more calories for those who don't really like eating.


1. Start early. I've never been a breakfast person. I'm not sure why but I've always preferred to start eating around noon even though I wake up at 7. BUt squeezing 3,000 calories worth of food into the time frame between noon and bed time was out of the question. No matter how Much I tried it just never happened. So I started eating breakfast. Even If it was only an extra 500-700 calories it brought me closer to my goal, and it also got me in more of an eating mood for when lunch came around.


2. Drink your calories. I don't know what it is, but looking at solid food makes me not want to eat even more than I already didn't want to. But seeing a chocolate protein shake or a fruit/veggie smoothie is completely the opposite. I can't seem to get enough of it and before I know it I've already met my caloric goal for that meal. And to make things even better it helps me get in my veggies (never really been a fan if it wasn't broccoli, peas, or a salad).


3. This one is the one that has helped me the most. And it's to exercise before eating. After I exercise I get a strong urge to consume everything in my path for the 30-45 minute window after I finish. Once that window is over it's business as usual unfortunately. But once I discovered that it helped out a lot and I changed my routine to mirror that fact. I train twice a day now, once in the morning before breakfast and once at night before dinner, And before lunch I might do a bit of a jog/sprint interval.

All in all those three things have helped me get in my calories consistently along with other minor things like entering my meal into myfitness pal before I eat it (I don't like to be made out to be a liar, even to myself), and focusing only on eating when food is in front of me.

I hope some of these tips can be utilized to help some of you out if your having similar issues.",2015-11-11 22:44:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3sgq70/how_to_gain_more_weight_when_bulking_with/

I designed the work out to increase general fitness. I tried to hit all of the main areas, Arms, chest, core, back, legs. I am not attached to this routine but have found that it challenges me and maintains my fitness level but plateaus at a certain point.   

I don't follow a particularly diet but this is generally how I eat:  
Breakfast: Smoothie - Berries, 2 TBSP of peanut butter, one banana, 8oz of almond milk.  
Lunch: Sand which and a side (typically chips)   
Dinner: Meat, veggies, rice/pasta  
If I snack it will be a handful of almonds.   
I tend to eat a couple small cookies after dinner to.

1wgt9x,bodyweightfitness,"First time here, sorry I missed Moronic Mondays, but maybe I can still ask a couple stupid questions?","EDIT: Thanks to everybody who responded! You guys are great! It's nice to find a community that gives solid, honest answers. A lot of subs can be hit or miss in that category. I've taken all of your advice into consideration. 

First off, I just want to say that this is a wonderful, very well organized sub. I've gone through the FAQ, training guide, and progression wiki and wow, stellar work! 

Before I get into my questions, here's a quick backstory on myself. I've been fairly active my whole life (skateboarded for 16 years and I still do, attended a parkour gym for 2 years and for one of those years I was an instructor) and ate relatively healthy (don't eat fast food or drink sodas very often, but I do have a soft spot for sweets) and I've been skinny my whole life (28 years old, 5'11'', never broke 150lbs under recently). I've never been too concerned about my figure, but this year I decided that will be my ""thing"": calisthenics, bodyweight fitness, and everything in between.

And so, here's my dilemma (if you can call it that): I don't know how to gain weight and/or muscle mass. When I was active at the parkour gym, I was going 3 times a week and was a lot more active and eating a lot more at the time, but never saw an ounce of muscle mass or weight gain. I went from only being able to do a couple pull ups to doing couple muscle ups within a year, and yet I still looked the same. I mean, I know a lot of it has to do with genes, but I still feel I'm doing something wrong or maybe just not enough.

In the past 6 months I started taking creatine and protein powder while starting a body building program (you know, picking heavy things up and setting them down, and the elusive bench press), but all that really did was give me a thicker waistline. I actually LOST definition in my abs with my arms staying relatively the same size. According to all the articles I read, that should have been a sure fire way to build muscle definition, but either I wasn't doing enough or not doing it correctly.

In any event, body building is just not for me and while I'm at the gym I feel like a wallflower on prom night, so I'm ready to get back into parkour and, more importantly, work in a healthy dose of calisthenics.  I guess in the end, and this is gonna sound so vain, I just want visual acknowledgement of my hard work.

So as of right now, I'm working out 3 times a week cycling through the major muscle groups (triceps and back one day, biceps another, etc), but I'm about to drop that routine completely and start doing calisthenic oriented workouts with the parallettes and such. With what kind of diet should I accompany that? As of right now my diet is virtually the same everyday: fruit smoothie in the morning, fruit for snacks throughout the day (apples, oranges, mangos, bananas, kiwis, berries, the whole nine), some greek yogurt with homemade granola bars, with lunch being a salad or whatever was leftover from dinner the night before, and then dinner consisting of some form of protein (chicken, turkey, sometimes pork, red meat is usually had on the weekends) and veggies, usually steamed. I'm usually done eating by 7pm and in bed by 10-10:30, waking up at 5:30am the next morning (I know, not enough sleep!). I eat a piece of chocolate maybe 3 times a week (I'm a binge chocolate consumer, so I try to stay away from it. I eat oreos by the sleeve), I don't drink coffee and I have a soda maybe twice a month, and I try to stay away from chips cuz a ""serving size"" to me is an entire bag. Oh, and I don't smoke and I had my first beer last year. Since then I've gone out to happy hours a handful of times. I say 10 within the last year.  

So, is that not enough food? Should I be eating more? Eating better? If so, what? And how? Currently I'm plenty stuffed throughout the day. I'm not sure where I would squeeze in more food. The one time I tried to ""bulk up"" (this past 6 months), the weight went directly to my waist and nowhere else. 

I've never talked to anybody about this, but there's only so many articles you can read on the subject, so hopefully you guys will be kind and courteous and point me in the right direction. I'm looking forward to a year of dips, L sits, and planches. I can't wait!",2014-01-29 14:45:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1wgt9x/first_time_here_sorry_i_missed_moronic_mondays/
1i08ha,bodyweightfitness,"My Progress, and a huge thank you to all on the subreddit!","I started doing bodyweight training, in addition to rowing for cardio,  to get back into the kind of shape I was in while in the Army. I've been at it for two months, and with the help of the FAQ routines and the veteran posters, I'm down to 172 lbs from 222 lbs while getting my first real pullup and chinup since my labrum in my shoulder was repaired. 

For those that are interested in my diet, I eat mainly a Japanese diet (My wife does all of the cooking). 

**Breakfast:** 3/4 cup Rolled Oats with dash of salt and some dried fruit (Cranberries, Currants, Raisins), and a Boiled or Fried Egg. If I'm in a rush, I'll have a Turkey Bacon and Egg on wheat toast from the food truck outside of my office

**Lunch:** Whatever was left over from dinner, unless we eat fish for dinner. Mrs. Crowley will cook something with beef or chicken then fill my lunch box up with brown rice, salad and japanese side dishes. If she doesn't cook, I'll get a grilled chicken pita w/ no sauce from the food truck. 

**Dinner:** Fish 4-5x a week, Beef or Pork 1x a week, Chicken 2x a week with various Japanese side dishes, Miso Soup and Rice. 

**Snacks:** Apples w/ Peanut Butter, Green Smoothie w/ Hemp Protein, Nuts, Carrots, Celery etc. The occasional Oatmeal Cookie, or Biscotti if my wife makes them.

Where I was going wrong was too much alcohol, and snacking on garbage between meals. 

Now that my initial goals have been accomplished, I'm pushing through on getting stronger and stronger. I'll take a picture of myself tonight, and in another few months I'll do a before and after :)

This subreddit has been such a great motivation tool for me to finally get rid of the post army weight gain! Thank you to all, and if you're new to this subreddit or bodyweight fitness, don't feel overwhelmed. Just get your numbers in!

1guwow,bodyweightfitness,Exhaustion Question Re FAQ Program,"In short, how on earth can you guys/girls hit that many exercises hard in one workout?

I've been bodyweight training for two years since discovering convict conditioning. I started out at age 31, 5'11"" and 125 lbs with terribly low energy. I think I was eating 1500 calories a day or less.

I've gained to 155 lbs now currently aiming for 2700 cals a day but not sure how often I am hitting it. I am heavily restricted by food intolerances (potato and sugar and everything that trickles out to) as well as a long list of food that doesn't agree with me for no known reason, though this list should shrink over time.

Energy has improved over time and I've started experimenting with other ideas and programs besides CC, which has led me to the suggested program from the sidebar.

The 5 to 8 rep range has been very encouraging, as CC can be quite daunting in that regard.

However my issue is that if I pour it into a couple exercises, I tire very quickly. Muscles shaking, and a rather unpleasant lightheadedness. No known medical problems, doctors said more protein. I currently have a 40g protein  smoothie most every day, 1-2 eggs, and some form of chicken pork or fish with all both meals.

The thought of hitting each of those boxes (hard) in the FAQ digram is very out of reach at this point though.

Wondering if this is common, are most people able to push hard on that many exercises without their body giving out? Is this an indication of still being short on calories? Or do you hit a couple hard and do very easy variations of the others?

For now I'm planning to hunt more calories (and start tracking again) and adapt my CC routine to mix in extras inspires by FAQ  on days where the energy is there.

Just wondering if anyone would be willing to share thoughts/experiences on the above. Much thanks.

1l9w9jf,weightroom,[Program Review] - Recovering Powerlifters by Geoffrey Verity Schofield,"I don't see a lot of bodybuilding-focused program reviews here, so I'm hoping this one will be well-received. I know GVS generally has a solid reputation in some of the bodybuilding subs, but in my opinion he's somewhat of an underrepresented individual in this space. I don't agree with absolutely everything he does/says, but after running this program of his, it's difficult to argue that his methods don't work.

TL;DR - made some of the best gains in my life in as little as eight weeks

# Background

I'm a 29-year old male (30 in a couple months) with a background in track & field and rugby from high school. Since then, I've focused pretty much entirely to lifting. I don't compete in anything, but my training over the years has been very solidly powerlifting-focused. I've been lifting off-and-on since my track days in high school. I got serious with strength training a couple years after that, though, but I would go through spurts of focusing heavily on lifting, then either switching focus to other hobbies for a while or just not having time in the day to go to the gym for whatever reason. I would estimate my total training age to be approximately five years.

As far as my life outside of the gym, I work from home, have access to a home gym with a power rack, platform, barbell, adjustable dumbbells, SSB, and some other goodies here and there, and I also have a free membership to a local gym because I coach there. I am incredibly fortunate to have this level of flexibility and variety in how, where, and what I train.

Programs I've run include Fierce 5 (the first program I ran out of high school), nSun's, various GZCL programs (GZCLP, J&T 2.0, General Gainz), and a whole bunch of cycles of Greg Nuckols' 28 free programs, which I had been running on a harsh cut immediately before beginning Recovering Powerlifters. Speaking of which, here are my stats the day I started this:

|Height|5'10""|3'1""|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Weight**|183lbs|176lbs|
|**Squat**|475lbs (lifetime|455lbs|
|**Bench**|275lbs (lifetime)|240lbs|
|**Deadlift**|600lbs (lifetime)|585lbs|

Lifetime PRs were hit about a month before the current numbers. Lost some strength due to the cut. Not that these numbers really matter, but hopefully they give you a sense of where I was at.

# The Program

I'm not going to go into too much detail here. The program is available for free on Boostcamp; however, I prefer using Google Sheets for my programming, so I followed the instructions in GVS' [video on the program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX2eBgvJAG4) and made my own spreadsheet for it.

In summary, however, Recovering Powerlifters is a 12-week bodybuilding program with emphasis on common weak points in the physique of a strength-based athlete like myself. It is ran 5 days a week, with three upper body days and two lower body days, and contains heavy emphasis on arms and delts (one of the upper body days is entirely arm and delt movements) which is great because mine are/were absolutely tiny and shapeless from years of focusing on SBD.

I generally kept to the program as written, opting to drop SBD almost entirely. I swapped a couple exercises out for other exercises out of preference or due to equipment availability on the days I trained at home. As time went on, I also swapped out a few exercises here and there if I either got bored of them or felt they weren't doing much for me. About the only ""powerlifting"" movement I kept in for the duration of the program was SSB squats one day a week.

I would consider this to be a moderate-volume, high-intensity program, at least how I ran it; every single set was taken at a minimum one rep away from failure. There were times that I recognized I sandbagged a set - if that happened, I would do one extra set and make sure I pushed myself as hard as I could. That being said, I'm confident that the vast majority of my work was done at, or at least very near failure.

There isn't really a clear progression scheme like you would find in most strength programs. I basically just increased the weight if I reached the highest point of the prescribed rep range on the first set. GVS does incorporate autoregulation in the form of adding a set if you feel good - I used this option to add a set if I couldn't add a rep from the previous week. I felt this really helped push the progression, though it's not necessarily part of the program to do so.

# The Diet

My eating started off very consistent, but kinda ended up all over the place; more on that later.

My aim here was to gain as much lean mass as possible, while minimizing body fat gain. Skip to the Results section for details on how that went. I aimed for an average rate of gain of about half a pound a week - however, I don't count calories because that's boring and instead relied on how the scale was moving to inform my eating. I overshot my weight gain goals a bit, but I'm not unhappy about that.

There were two things I consumed almost every single day from the start of the program: Greek yogurt with chocolate protein powder & granola (literally tastes like chocolate pudding), and two cups of ultrafiltered chocolate milk. As time went on I needed to add some extra calories, so I added things like trail mix, PB&J's, smoothies, and so on. For lunches and dinners, I usually did some sort of meal prep where I would cook a whole bunch of protein (braised beef or pork is a favorite of mine for this), cut up and freeze a rotisserie chicken, wash and cut a bunch of veggies, and so on, then my wife and I could make a bunch of different kinds of wraps, bowls, sandwiches, and so on. This has been working well for us, as she's been working and studying and my work hours go into the evenings, so we can't really make dinners together often.

That being said, all this kind fell apart around week 9-10 because we added a puppy to the family, and as it turns out puppies are a lot of work and take up a lot of time and attention.

# The Process

The initially adjustment to the very high-intensity training style that I did here took some getting used to. That being said, I've never felt like I've earned my progress more than I have running this program. Some of the days were brutal (especially the leg days - Bulgarian split squats to failure friggin' suck, dude), but the rate at which I progressed proved to me that in the past years, I just haven't been training hard enough. That was kind of a bitter pill to swallow, but one that was much needed.

On occasion I did have to cut workouts short for whatever reason, but I didn't feel this impacted my progress significantly.

Everything went really, really well, up until the point where we picked up our puppy. I took that first week with him off, and in the second week I returned to do some quick workouts in the home gym. Then, in the last week of the program, I injured my neck (unrelated to lifting) and took a few days off again while I focused on getting it back into reasonable shape. All this, combined with kinda crappy eating, resulted in lackluster progress in the last few weeks of the program.

That being said, I consistently got stronger across pretty much every single movement I did throughout the program, even on my SSB squats, which I added about 30lbs to over the 12 weeks. If I couldn't match reps from the previous week, adding an extra set was always enough to push my progress.

# The Results

This section is gonna be a little bit different. I don't have any lift numbers I'm going to share. However, with the help of [this calculator](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/your-drug-free-muscle-and-strength-potential-part-2/) from Stronger By Science, I tracked my changes in weight, lean body mass, fat mass, and body fat percentage for every single week of the program. Every four weeks, I also took whole-body measurements to see how much I was growing. You can find that spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xO_QXjP-suabZya3Ve8yd7TIHOvqDHVMN9pptIl8z80/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I even made a page for Imperial for all you freedom lovers out there.

In short, I peaked around week 9-10 (which is right before we got the puppy) and declined overall somewhat after that point due to all the factors I already discussed. See the table below for a summary of the results up to the end of week 12:

|Stats|Before (kg/lbs, cm/in)|Week 8-10 Peak|End|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Weight**|79.2 / 175.6|85.41 / 187|85.23 / 187.9|
|**Body Fat %**|15.16|15.98|16.57|
|**Fat Mass**|12.01 / 26.48|13.64 / 28.35|14.13 / 31.14|
|**Lean Mass**|67.19 / 148.13|71.77 / 158.64|71.10 / 156.76|
|**Shoulders**|122.25 / 48.13|127.5 / 50.20|128.25 / 50.49|
|**Chest**|108.5 / 42.72|113.25 / 44.59|111 / 43.70|
|**Arms (flexed)**|37 / 14.57|40 / 15.75|39.5 / 15.55|
|**Waist**|86 / 33.85|88 / 34.65|88 / 34.65|
|**Legs**|64 / 25.20|67.5 / 26.58|69 / 27.17|

I gained 8-10 pounds of lean mass, added about an inch to my arms, about two inches to my shoulders, and only added about 1.5 percent to my bodyfat (and even then, a lot of that increase came from the last couple weeks when I started eating like crap).

Disclaimer: I know these numbers may be *very* approximate; that being said, I feel confident in their general accuracy.

I didn't take many physique photos (almost entirely because I pretty much suck at getting good, consistent lighting that I feel accurately shows the progress I'm making). That being said, below are a couple photos I took. The first one is from April 3, so week 3-4ish, and the second is from the end of week 8, so a 4-5 week and approximately 7lb difference in bodyweight.

For some other observations, I started noticing some quad separation at rest in certain lighting (which I've literally never seen before in my legs) around week 8. At around week 5, my wife told me I need a bra for my B-cups. Some random old guy on the street told me I look strong at one point in there. So yeah, that's all kinda cool.

# The Final Thoughts

Honestly, if you've ever felt like you're not training hard enough, that you don't know what true failure feels like, or, honestly, even if it's been a while since you've done some absolute eye-bursting lifting, give a GVS program a try.

Your mileage may vary, but at no point did I feel like I was really getting run-down. I'm confident that had the puppy not come into the picture that I would have been totally fine running the full 12-weeks all the way through.

Bodybuilding is super terrible and fun and everything in between and I highly recommend giving a pure bodybuilding-focused program a go, even if it's not from GVS.

# What's Next?

Honestly? Now that I'm getting back into the swing of things with training and eating, I'm gonna run this again, but with a few tweaks:

* To further emphasize arm & shoulder development, I'm going to move those exercises to the start of the workout. I'm also going to add additional rear delt movement to bring those up further, because I felt mine could handle a crap ton more volume if I wanted.
* I'm also going to shift focus to hamstrings rather than quads. My quads are in decent shape, but my hammies are a bit unbalanced I feel. I'll also be doing these at the start of my leg days rather than after quads, and will also add some extra sets. I'll also do high-intensity lengthened partials for my leg curls

My goal is to continue bulking until my body fat percentage hits roughly 20. I dunno how heavy I'll be at that point, but I'm sure I'll continue to get way more jacked.",2025-06-12 19:58:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1l9w9jf/program_review_recovering_powerlifters_by/
12elhoc,weightroom,Program Review: Brian Alsruhe's Mass Builder,"#My Background:

I‚Äôm 28 years old, and have been lifting consistently for the past 8 years. Since I largely learned about programming from lurking on Reddit, I‚Äôve tried just about every program that‚Äôs been popular here since 2015: many variations of 5/3/1 and GZCL, Greg Nuckols programming, Sheiko, Mag-Ort, and Brian Alsruhe programs, to name a few. Over this time, I‚Äôve gone from being a 160 lb. 6‚Äô skellie up to 213 lb as of the start of this program. I‚Äôve done two powerlifting competitions, but once I tried strongman, I found that I enjoyed it much more. I‚Äôve competed in 5 strongman competitions: 2 novice and then 3 open. I‚Äôm not very competitive yet, never having gotten out of the bottom half in open competitions. 

In the past 2 years I‚Äôve had several health problems that have prevented me from gaining much strength.  In early 2021, I got a strain in my right glute that made deadlifting anything above 225 lbs. extremely painful. I could do elevated deadlifts though, so I decided to train for a competition in the summer that had a Ukrainian deadlift while also doing the daily rehab work prescribed by my physical therapist. Unfortunately, during that competition I broke my thumb by smashing it on my belt when lowering an axle clean. I still finished the competition (and actually did better on the events post-broken thumb than pre-broken-thumb!), but I did need surgery to repair my hand, which meant 6 weeks off from any form of lifting. This did seem to benefit my glute injury, which had completely disappeared by the time my surgeon cleared me for lifting again. But I didn‚Äôt have much time to get back into training before I caught a very rough case of covid in January 2022. Even after beating the virus, my lungs were really weak, and for 2 months I couldn‚Äôt do any exercise more strenuous than a mile long walk. 

I‚Äôve eased myself back into training over the spring and fall of this year, while also going through many major life changes: finishing grad school, moving in with my girlfriend, and starting a full-time work-from-home job. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have the money and space to build up a nice home gym in my basement, with a bunch of strongman implements in my garage. A strongman competition I was planning to do in November got cancelled, but that was okay by me‚Äîwhen my training partner and I did a mock meet with lighter than contest weights, my log numbers were 20 lbs. lower than I needed to be to not zero the event, and it took me about 20 minutes for my breathing and heart rate to recover from the truck pull/loading medley. 

## Why I picked this program:

I wanted to get my lungs and conditioning back on track, while also focusing on building up my overhead strength.  My gym setup only allows me to use implements outside, but the cold/wet/snowy weather where I live in northern Illinois makes that untenable in the winter. I thought the giant set format that Brian Alsruhe‚Äôs programming uses would be a good way to build up work capacity for strongman without the need to use implements or do moving events. I had really enjoyed my incomplete runs of his Powerbuilder and Darkhorse programs, so I already knew what I was getting myself into. Of Brian‚Äôs programs, [The Mass Builder](https://youtu.be/xm_JW-8ZczQ) sounded like the most fun, contained giants sets with a dedicated conditioning movement, and gave me a great excuse to go on a proper winter B U L K T O 220 and fill out the middleweight weight class. 

# Program Structure and my Customizations: 

This table summarizes how I set up the program. You can see additional images that help explain the structure and weights/reps [here](https://youtu.be/xm_JW-8ZczQ?t=1244) and [here](https://youtu.be/xm_JW-8ZczQ?t=1299) in Brian‚Äôs video about the program.

Each workout of the Alsruhe Mass Builder has three components: Giant sets of a main lift variation (which is where the heaviest work is done in this program. If you want heavy competition squat/bench/deadlift, you‚Äôll be disappointed with this program), giant sets/EMOM work with a main lift, then an assistance finisher. There‚Äôs also optional dedicated conditioning that you can slot in at the beginning or end of the workout. It‚Äôs a Upper/Lower split, with 2x/week frequency for squat, bench, deadlift, and OHP or close variations. Brian‚Äôs original version is a 4x/week program, run in four 3-week waves. I wanted to put extra emphasis on overhead pressing, but could not do standing OHP due to the 7‚Äô2‚Äù ceilings in my basement gym, so I did seated OHP instead. I also added an extra day to the base program with incline bench as the main lift, and added slingshot bench in as an additional pressing variant. Each workout took about 60-80 minutes, including setup and teardown time. 

## Variation Lifts

The main lift variations have a rotating percentages system, where in each 3-week-long wave, you‚Äôll have a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù, ‚Äúmedium‚Äù, and ‚Äúlight‚Äù day for each variation, where the reps decrease as the weights are heavier. Each wave has slightly heavier and lower reps than the previous wave (i.e Wave 1‚Äôs Medium sets/reps are Wave 2‚Äôs Light sets/reps, Wave 1‚Äôs Heavy sets/reps are Wave 2‚Äôs Medium sets, and so on). The variation work is done in a giant set of four exercises, with an antagonistic movement, the main movement, a core movement, and then a conditioning movement. The antagonistic movement is horizontal/vertical pull for the bench/press, and for Squat and Deadlift, Brian considers the antagonistic lift an explosive jump or hip extension. The variation lifts I used were the close-grip bench, high handle trap bar deadlift, slingshot bench, SSB squat, and Z Press. 

## Giant Sets

The 4 exercise giant sets can be quite overwhelming to plan out. Only the main mover has programmed set/rep schemes, and you need to figure out your own progression schemes for the other 3 lifts. It could have been a massive programming rabbit hole, but I think I came up with a few simplifications to make it 
easier to set up and execute. I kept the pulling and core movement the same for both the variation and main lifts on each day to reduce the setup time and number of exercises I had to choose. For example, on the Close Grip/Flat bench day, I did barbell rows as my pulling movement and dragon flags as my core movement for the slingshot and flat bench. 

My progression scheme for pullups was to do 7 per set in wave 1, and added one per set in each wave. For Barbell rows, I did sets of 8, 9, then 10 in each week of each wave, with the weight increasing by 10 lbs per wave. For cable rows, I always did sets of 10, with weights increasing by 10 pounds for two weeks, and dropping back by 10 for the next wave (2 steps forward, 1 step back). After wave 3, I felt that I had been too conservative with the weights increases, so I didn‚Äôt decrease the weight going into the final wave. I didn‚Äôt really have a progression scheme for face pulls/band pullaparts; I just did about 15-20 of them with the same bands throughout the program. I think it makes sense to not push hard on these movements, as they‚Äôre easy prehab movements that are paired with lower-body lifts that are far more taxing than any pressing. 

For the core work, my initial thought was that timed holds would be harder than rep work, so I would do rep work on the lower body days to try to make those giant sets a bit easier. I did dragon flags on my closegrip/flat bench day, since I could do those without even moving from the bench. I started at 4 reps and added one per wave. I did ab wheel rollouts on Trapbar DL/Squat days, starting at 5 reps per set and adding 1 per wave. I did timed superman holds and planks on Slingshot/OHP and Z Press/Incline days, respectively. I started at 40 seconds and added 5 seconds each wave. On the SSB/Deadlift days, I initially did hanging leg raises, but as the waves progressed, my grip became a limiting factor when part of the deadlift superset, since the deadlift, hanging leg raises, and KB swings were all taxing my grip. I wasn‚Äôt happy with how much I had to wait for my grip to recover, so I eventually swapped these out for the superman holds and found that worked fine. 

For every giant set on each day of the workout, my conditioning movement was a kettlebell swing with my plate loadable kettlebell. It‚Äôs a movement I haven‚Äôt done very much, and I also wanted to justify my recent purchase of Rogue‚Äôs adjustable kettlebell to myself. Since I was doing the same weight every week, it took no setup time. This was also the easiest conditioning exercise to do in a low-ceilinged and cramped basement where there was not enough space to do (unlike things like hammer swings, jumps, barbell complexes, or animal walks). I did 10 kb swings per set with 58 lbs (two 25 lb plates plus 8 lbs base weight) in the first week, then added a rep per week through week 9. At that point, the swing sets were starting to get really long and a bit boring (and hard for my brain to count when in a meatheaded fugue state), so in the final cycle I increased the weight to 68 lbs, and did 10 swings/set in week 10, 12 swings/set in week 11, and 15 swings/set in week 12. Now that I‚Äôve got lots of experience with the movement, maybe I‚Äôll hop on the bandwagon for the 10,000 kettlebell swings in a month challenge.

## Main Lifts

After the variation lift giant set, the second part of each workout has you doing your main lift at one of three rep schemes: Light (10x3 EMOM), Medium (4x8 Giant Sets), or Heavy (5x5 Giant sets). These lifts start at 55%, 60%, and 70% respectively, and increase by 5% each wave. The light EMOM work is not done as a giant set, so those workouts go by much quicker. My main lifts were the bench press, back squat, seated overhead press, deadlift, and incline bench.  

## Assistance Finishers

The third component of each workout is an assistance finisher, which also have heavy, medium, and light versions that you cycle through in each wave. These in effect are like WODs that you do at the end of your workout. I pulled these from a variety of sources: Brian Alsruhe‚Äôs videos, /u/MythicalStrength‚Äôs [Book Of Bad Ideas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dE8hMSQdnWTzwOitrJjzJq2EeZ4ZzoJT/view), agonist supersets (rather than the antagonist supersets that Brian Alsruhe is well known for) based on [this video from Mike Israetel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqlQrt2VFQc) and from pump workouts my training partner and I used to do. The goal here was to find fun ways to get in a bunch of accessory work in a short period of time, and I‚Äôd often end up with a pump as a nice bonus.  

## Optional Conditioning

Brian does include optional conditioning section either at the start or end of the workout. I tried out doing a dedicated conditioning segment at the end of my very first day running the program, which consisted of doing 10 minutes of alternating between sets pull-ups, dips, and kettlebell swings for 10 minutes straight. I was totally gassed after doing this, and decided that I would just push hard on the giant sets throughout the program and not do a separate conditioning portion of the workout, which I think was the right decision. Even without dedicated conditioning, I would just come upstairs and lay on the couch for a while after finishing each workout; more exercise would have made me useless for the rest of the evening. 

## Scheduling

I had two vacations and 3 trips for work while running this program, which when combined with adding an extra day per week made this 12 week program take 13.5 weeks for me to complete. When possible while travelling for work, I‚Äôd do assistance finishers from the upcoming week‚Äôs workouts in the hotel gym. It was nice to get some exercise in while travelling, which reduced soreness when returning to my regular schedule, and also shortened the workouts in the upcoming week. I did not skip any workouts, but on days when I ran out of time to work out or got too gassed, I would stop after finishing the variation or main work, and finish the rest of the workout on the following day.

##Variation Work Analysis: 

The way the variation lifts are set up is exceptionally well designed. At first glance, it‚Äôs reminiscent of 5/3/1, where you have 3 sets which each increase in intensity by 10% while the rep ranges get smaller, with the final set being an AMRAP. But unlike 5/3/1, the percentages are based on true maxes rather than a training max. Also unlike many variants of 5/3/1, where the first two sets often feel like they‚Äôre your last warmups, I never felt like the first two sets here were too easy‚Äîthey always felt like solid working sets.  

Before doing the AMRAP set of the day, I‚Äôd look at my past few weeks‚Äô performance and pick a goal rep number that would give me a small estimated 1RM PR, or at least more reps than the last time I did an AMRAP at that weight. The rotating structure of the heavy, medium, and light weights means that you never repeat the same AMRAP weight closer than two weeks apart. This makes it pretty easy to hit either a rep PR with a weight or an estimated 1RM PR every time you work out, which was always a good motivational boost that made me excited to continue and move on to the next section of the workout. 

Over the course of the program, I always got at least 2 reps over the minimum target on the AMRAPs, and I always either tied or beat my previous rep record with any given weight. With so many AMRAPs at so many different percentages of my maxes, I was able to develop a quite accurate sense of how close to failure I was getting. The last rep of the AMRAPs was always slow and sometimes grindy, but only once during the 60 AMRAPs I did over the course of the program did I get too greedy with an AMRAP and fail a rep. While it‚Äôs a complicated progression scheme that requires a spreadsheet, this program has by far my favorite use of AMRAPs as a fun challenge that keeps the workouts engaging and challenging. 

In the first cycle, the giant sets left me pretty gassed and I was taking as much as 4 minutes between them, especially on lower body days. By the end of the program, I was down to around 2 minutes of rest between giant sets on the upper body days, and around 3 minutes on lower body days, a great sign that my conditioning had significantly improved! Early in the program, I would often just lay down on my bench for a few minutes after finishing the workout, but I found myself doing that less often at the end of the program, even though all the weights were much heavier and all the assistance work had gotten harder. 

##Main Work Analysis: 

EMOM work was my favorite of the three rep schemes for the main lifts. EMOM work gets you very efficient at doing your setup because the faster you complete your set, the more rest you get before your next set. I think they‚Äôre also a good way to get a good stimulus from weights that are further away from your max. These workouts also tended to be among the shortest, especially for the lower body workouts. I‚Äôll definitely be doing more EMOM work in the future. 

The 5x5 and 4x8 rep schemes were not as fun as the EMOM work. They also took quite a bit more time due to the giant set format, typically being 25-30 minutes for 5x5 and 20-25 for 4x8, whereas EMOMs were done in 10 minutes. That said, the weight percentages were expertly chosen. After finishing the first wave, I thought there was no way I‚Äôd be able to hit the weights called for in the final waves, but in the end I was just strong enough to get through everything. The final wave has you doing 5x5@85% of your max, and sometimes got a bit grindy, but I never missed a rep. Any program that can get you up to doing 5x5 @ 85% in 12 weeks is truly impressive. In order to balance out the length/difficult of workouts, I should have done assistance finishers that were shorter on the 5x5 and 4x8 days, with the option to do longer ones on the EMOM days.  

The lower body days were often very draining, especially if the main lift was a 5x5 or 4x8 rep scheme. There were a few times when I was feeling really tired and I‚Äôd just do the first one or two thirds of the workout, and complete the rest of the workout on the following day. I had expected these workouts to be harder than the upper body workouts and tried to make the lower body workouts less draining by doing easy prehab movements as the first element of the giant set, but this alone wasn‚Äôt enough. Lower body workouts were made even harder when I travelled, and would drop below 2x/week frequency on lower body lifts. To avoid crushing DOMs, I think I‚Äôd prefer to have some upper and lower body work on every day so that my frequency is high enough that I won‚Äôt ever go too long between squat/DL sessions. This was compounded by my decision to add a third upper body day, which meant that the weekly schedule was ULULU rather than ULUL, which sometimes made for too many days between lower-body workouts. After my first intense leg soreness that made it embarrassingly hard to stand up and sit down the next day, I decided I‚Äôd proactively swap around workouts when I was going to be travelling to try to minimize the time between lower body workouts. I still think that my soreness is kept in check best by having some form of squatting/deadlifting on at least 3 days per week. To make that work with the wave structure of this program while still doing a good job of managing fatigue would require some careful work. It would even open up the possibility of upper/lower body giant sets, which I really enjoy as a time-saver. 

##Assistance Finisher Analysis: 

I hadn‚Äôt done many challenge-style WODs before this program, and found that I really loved them. I think other lifters give crossfit WODs a bad rap, but I think they can be a nutritious part of a complete program. I expect that many assistance finishers I did for this program will enter my regular rotation. If you keep the same assistance finishers for each cycle, then you‚Äôll be revisiting them every three weeks. Much like the AMRAPs in the variation work, this is enough time for most people to have gotten stronger and have a good chance of exceeding their previous performance, which is always a fun motivational boost. I‚Äôll discuss some of the highlights and lowlights of my assistance finishers few paragraphs. If you want more thoughts on the other finishers I did, let me know in the comments. 

Mythical Strength‚Äôs ‚Äú+2 bonus to squats‚Äù is a great workout for squats (or really any lift where your max is 350-600), and I loved doing it for both the back squat and the trap bar deadlift. Start with a weight that can be made with 45s and 25s that‚Äôs around 85-90% of your max and do a hard set of 1-5 reps. Then remove a 25/45, and do 2 more reps than in your first set, and repeat until you‚Äôre at 135 (or you give up/get bored/ run out of time). It gives a great pump, and is basically a slow way of putting away your weights. 

My Heavy OHP finisher was initially going to be Crossfit Grace (do 30 clean and press with 135 lbs as fast as possible) with seated strict press. Unfortunately because I‚Äôm so awful at seated OHP, I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to complete 30 reps. So I turned it into a challenge to get as many reps at 135 as I could, and ended up getting 13, 15, 20, and 22 reps in each cycle. I‚Äôll reuse the format of ‚Äúget as many reps as possible with x lift at y weight in 10 minutes‚Äù, which should work well for a wide variety of lifts. 

Bring Sally Up (perform reps in time with the lyrics of this song(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A2V9Bu80J4) , total of 30 reps over 3.5 minutes) was a lot of fun on squats. I did it with an SSB to take arm/elbow/wrist cramping out of the equation. I increased the weight each cycle, starting with just the bar and finishing with 155 lbs, but probably had room for more. For pushups, however, I hated it. I was limited more by my inability to hold a plank for much more than a minute than by chest/tricep strength, which led to me just feeling like I was wasting my time once I couldn‚Äôt plank in between pushups. So I didn‚Äôt get a pump, and did about 15 pushups while with a plank for a minute and a half. In cycle 4, I swapped this workout out for doing 100 bodyweight dips in as little time as possible (getting it done in 10 minutes flat). This was much more enjoyable, and something I‚Äôll probably do again. 

A finisher that I love doing whose origins I can‚Äôt remember is the Dumbbell Press Incline drop set, wherein I start with a dumbbell seated overhead press, and then drop the angle of the press rather than the weight, so that eventually I‚Äôm doing a flat bench. This works well if you have an adjustable bench with lots of settings (mine has 10, from 0 to 90 degrees in 10 degree increments increments), but might not be as fun if you don‚Äôt have many settings. For extra fun, you can superset with one or two other isolation movements. 

I really enjoyed doing agonist supersets as part of a bench or bench variation pyramid. I‚Äôd do a set of 10 tricep extensions, then 3-5 bench presses, add 20 lbs to the bench, and repeat until I got to a max effort weight. Then drop by increments of 10 lbs on the way back down. This ended up being around 15 sets usually, took around 20 minutes, and was a ton of fun. If you want more ‚Äúrest‚Äù you can also add in a curl to the mix, but don‚Äôt rest in between doing each exercise for The Maximum Pump. 

Mythical Strengths‚Äô 135 trap bar deadlift AMRAP was a great test of grip and will. I ended up increasing my total number of reps each time I attempted it, going from 30 reps in cycle 1 to 51 in the last cycle. This is one I‚Äôll do regularly. I‚Äôd love to get into the triple digits with this. 

#Diet/Recovery/Etc: 

I have a work-from-home engineering job and haven‚Äôt been doing much physical activity outside the gym. I should have made more of an effort to go on a daily walk during the winter, but only went for walks on days when I had to run errands, around 3 times per week. I sleep about 6-7 hours per night on weeknights, and around 8 hours per night on weekends. 

Since I work from home and love to cook, I seldom eat out unless I‚Äôm travelling. In order to bulk for this program, I added Became A Hobbit and added a second breakfast. This was either a bagel with cream cheese or sausage patty and fried egg on an English muffin with aioli. My main breakfast was a smoothie of a banana, cup of frozen fruit, cup of oat milk, cup of orange juice, scoop of protein powder, and scoop of creatine (the only supplement I take). Lunch was either leftovers from earlier in the week or chicken sandwiches with chips and some fruit. My girlfriend is a vegetarian, so most of the meals I cooked for dinner were vegetarian (but always having a good amount of legumes/tofu/eggs/cheese for protein) and rice/potatoes/pasta for carbs. Sometimes in addition to the vegetarian food, I‚Äôd cook up a chicken breast for myself. I‚Äôd eat some ice cream or cookies for dessert a few times per week, and would have 2-3 drinks on a few nights per week. 

#Advice for Success with This Program

* Think carefully about the logistics of your giant sets. Don‚Äôt be like me and do hanging leg raise right after deadlifts; your grip won‚Äôt hold up. Dragon flags as a core variation right after bench variation is a good choice‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to move or set up any other equipment. 

* Don‚Äôt use old maxes for this program. I recommend testing your maxes prior to this program in the giant set format (that‚Äôs how I tested all my variations prior to running this program, since I didn‚Äôt have any maxes for them). This way, if you‚Äôre not accustomed to a high training density, your weights won‚Äôt be too brutally heavy. Then as you get used to it over this program, you‚Äôll feel awesome smashing your AMRAP targets. 

* Pick your assistance finishers to balance out the lengths of workouts. The Heavy assistance finishers will always follow EMOM work, so these can be longer, while I‚Äôd recommend doing something around 10 minutes or less for the Medium and Light assistance, since these follow your 4x8 and 5x5 main mover work. 

* Don‚Äôt go overboard with picking completely unique exercises for each giant sets. You get decent variety via the rep ranges and the assistance finishers, so you can cut down on analysis paralysis by repeating exercises between your variation/main work, or between days (as I did with the KB swings in every workout). 

#Final Thoughts

This program was awesome. I made huge strength gains across the board, adding 90 lbs to my PL total, and a large amount of weight to several variations. I‚Äôm back above 20 bodyweight pullups again, and finally hit a 3pl8 bench. My squat and deadlift gained 30 pounds each, and I‚Äôm well on my way to finally set new lifetime PRs on those lifts. I think my conditioning got a lot better based on how much rest I needed between giant sets at the beginning of the program versus the end of the program, thought that‚Äôs a bit less quantifiable. I‚Äôd love to hear any ideas people have for a good metric to evaluate conditioning. 

I also gained 7 lbs while increasing my arms by half an inch, my legs by 0.75 inches, and my chest by 1.5 inches while only gaining half an inch on my waist. I‚Äôm not sure how to measure shoulder size increase, but they definitely got a lot bigger. Most of my shirts and jackets are quite a bit harder to get around my shoulders now. 

I made major gains in strength, size, and conditioning while having a ton of fun. I‚Äôll probably run this program again next winter when it‚Äôs too cold/icy for event training and I want to make my arms even bigger. Brian's programming is incredible, and I thank him for putting out so many excellent programs for free. Anyone who's willing to work hard, has a well-stocked gym, and is willing to put in a decent amount of effort customizing it for your needs (or just [pay Brian to do it for you](https://www.neversate.com/merch), he deserves the money) could see great gains across a variety of dimensions running this program. 

#What‚Äôs next: 

In May, I‚Äôm going on a vacation to Brazil to visit my friend and training partner, who‚Äôs recently moved there. While I‚Äôm there, we‚Äôre doing a strongman competition with a circus DB ladder (45,50,55,65 kg), deadlift ladder (160,180,220,250 kg), log for reps (90 kg), and Hercules hold. My goal will be to at least get the first 3 DBs and DLs in the ladder. Those are above my current maxes but should be achievable with a decent peak. Now that it‚Äôs spring, I can train log consistently and should turn 90 kg from a max into a weight I can hit for a couple reps‚Äî5 would be a great number to hit. I‚Äôm going to run a frankenprogram using bits and pieces of mag-ort, Greg Nuckols programs, GZCL Jacked and Tan, and various assistance finishers to prep for this. All done in giant sets, of course. 

I‚Äôd like to hang around 220 lbs for a while and recomp. My waist has gotten a bit big for some of my pants and I‚Äôd prefer not having to squint to see my abs in the mirror. I'll do this by  ending my hobbit-style Second Breakfast.",2023-04-07 13:33:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/12elhoc/program_review_brian_alsruhes_mass_builder/

**HISTORY**

Before I started real fitness, I did some Tae Kwon Do as a teen and some fencing. Then I dated someone who loved walking and hiking everywhere. So that‚Äôs what I did for some time. Then I backpacked around Australia, and eventually worked on a cattle station for a stint. I then returned to Canada, then I decided to buy a bike and rode it everywhere. I eventually moved in with this bro who did crossfit, he said I should try. I gave it a go. I thought ‚Äúholy shit I‚Äôm really not fit.‚Äù And reliably started going multiple times a week for two years, then decided ‚Äúthis barbell shit is lit‚Äù and entered a powerlifting meet. After that first meet.... I knew I wanted to see how strong I can get.

*TL;DR: Did things, took me a while to decide powerlifting is fun*

I ran smolov jr, got some great high bar strength gains. Ran smolov and did too much on top of that, didn't listen to my body, got injured and burnt out. (The barbell got caught on my hair and pulled me down with it during a bail and I twisted my ankle)

I ran some other strength work, but I spent the entirety of last summer doing high intensity cycling + long distance cardio for a fondo event. (a 122km/76mile bike ride up a mountain). My diet was uncoordinated and I lost everything I gained from Smolov. Coming back, a 2 plate squat was rough. After the fondo, I had a month before a provincials powerlifting meet, got back a lot of strength, and qualified for regionals in Canada. I actually came here for advice. I just didn‚Äôt want to give up crossfit and cardio.

u/61742 suggested Russian Squat Routine. He seemed strong. My crossfit coach confirmed not only is it a great program, but you can run it alongside cf. Cool. I was in. I switched from high to low bar, did a few weeks of practice of Low Bar, tested a 1RM, hit 295lbs.

Oh, I also started a cut at this time.

**PRIOR TO RSR CYCLE**

* Squat: 1x135kg (295lbs) (Not bad, didn‚Äôt get a chance to test 315lbs, thought I‚Äôd be able to hit it, and decided to put that into the routine)

Weight was 85kg (187lbs)

**THE PROGRAM**

It‚Äôs a 3x per week 6 week squat program.

**PART 1**

Every other day for the first 3 weeks is your 80% for 6x2. The other days are 6 sets of increasing reps until you finish the first part of the cycle at 6x6 @ 80%.

**PART 2**

After that, every other day is the 6x2@80%, the other days are one less set and rep off the 6x6 but adding 5% (15lbs for me). 5x5  80% +15lbs, 4x4  80%+30lbs etc etc until you hit your max for a double (2x2)

So‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt exactly want to give up crossfit either. So I continued with it up until the testing week.

**EXECUTION**

On Mondays, Weds, and Fridays, I‚Äôd hit a morning session to focus on strength. I‚Äôd do RSR first, and then supplement with back and leg accessories, and then follow that with bench + arm accessories. I‚Äôd have an alternating week 1 bodyweight/DB focus (pull ups, push ups, dumbbell rows and presses) and a week 2 barbell accessory focus (barbell deadlifts, rows, lunges). This was just to get some traction in self programming. It wasn‚Äôt the focus, and was done only for self learning and I don‚Äôt mind most accessories.

I‚Äôd go to crossfit on those days, as well as on Sundays, Sat, and Tues. I‚Äôd rest on Thursdays. The total volume varied a little per week, but it was mostly 15-16ish hours of work per week. Women can typically handle a lot of volume, and since I was on a cut and leaning down, my gymnastics improved‚Ä¶.however

Due to the volume, after the 5x5 I actually did an impromptu deload week. In the deload week I aimed for same intensity, just greatly reduced volume. Right up to my 90% for doubles. I worked on handstand walks. It was a fun way to be at the gym and work on something without being taxing. [They really started to come along!](https://i.imgur.com/7ySycYT.mp4)

[I also did this silliness. Because why not?](https://i.imgur.com/dhAASNf.mp4)

After the deload, in returning to the program, I reduced the volume for the last three weeks and repeated the 5x5. CF classes were reduced to about 3x per week until the week of testing, where I stopped cf a week before I tested. I did the 2x2 on Monday, 6x2 on Weds, went for a swim on Thurs, and tested the following Sat.

On the suggestion of a friend, [I tried these for the first time](https://i.imgur.com/gZiCzzK.mp4), I don't know how to describe them (Quarter Squat recoveries?) but they were a fantastic way to introduce the feeling of heavier weight, and gain some confidence with the stimulus. I had attended a seminar held by Chad Wesley Smith who had given the suggestion of walkouts for the same ""feel what heavy weight is before your see it on the platform/test"" stimulus.

The 6x2s were tough some days, and some days they were such ego boosters. The 5x5 was probably the roughest day. If you're doing this program, yes, some days the 6x2 is hard, but that's what it's for. A recovery day without 0 stimulus. Your body is recovering, even if it feels weak in moving that weight. Don't worry.

Two weeks towards the end of the program I started Mag/Ort deadlift program to time it with a meet, they seem compatible.

**DIET**

Welp. So, here‚Äôs where it got intense. And it's here that made the situation work.

* I used RP‚Äôs 1 on 1 (Renaissance Periodization diet and nutrition coaching). Not only are macro goals given, the exact carbs, fats, and protein are delegated per meal depending on the time and training day. Bulk of carbs in the morning during double training days to replenish glycogen for the evening training (crossfit). I followed it almost 100% to a T.
* Not only are macros given, times given, and macro proportions per meal per training day given, but the food choices are also given. Just because I could make a cookie fit the macros, doesn‚Äôt mean it was the best thing I could do. So I didn‚Äôt deviate.
* I don‚Äôt eat meat or have dairy, so it was egg whites, nutritional yeast, tofu, pecans, broccoli, kale, other green veggies, and protein powder. I miss fries, beer, and real chocolate.
* I broke once or twice. It was always within the ‚Äògood food‚Äô given, but on testing week, where I wasn‚Äôt training, it got really hard. Very few carbs, and I broke one day and had, like, two extra smoothies. Going to the gym was easy, this diet was hard.

**RECOVERY**

Really tried to get my sleep, as I was putting the effort into diet and training. Some days were good, occasionally I cracked and got a 4hr sleep night, but most times I was able to get 6-7hrs in.

Epsom salt baths on sore days.

I changed some of the CF workouts - the coaches understood, in order to prevent too much strength overlap that would kill recovery.

**STATS AT THE END**

* Squat: 2x150kg (330lbs)
* Beltless 1x142kg (315lbs) [Pretty happy with the smoothness](https://i.imgur.com/PnlF4JX.mp4)
* 1RM BS 1x161kg/355lbs + 2x bodyweight squat (I'm not a small lady haha)

**WEIGHT**

* End of cycle 1: 80kg (177lbs)
* Down two notches on my lever belt. (This was a big surprise)

**PICS**

**CONCLUSIONS AND WHAT NEXT**

* Started running Mag/Ort, I did week 3 after the 1rm test and will start nuckols bench program 3x per week intermediate.
* It‚Äôs possible to complete a cycle on a calorific deficit. Monitor your recovery.
* Seek advice of others who know more than you.
* All the accessory dumbbell work really didn‚Äôt help my bench, but [my arms definitely gained mass :D.](https://i.imgur.com/ssNOHb4.jpg) And to be honest, my legs did as well.
* I really like egg whites and nutritional yeast, thank god, or this would have been impossible.
* I respond well to volume, but I need more experience on programming.
* To qualify for nationals, my goal is a 160 squat (achieved), 190 deadlift (15kg off), and a 70kg bench (5kg off). If I can do that with a 164lbs bodywieght (eventual goal) I‚Äôd hit a 400 Wilks. Which would be super cool.
* My diet up until this point had nowhere near enough protein. Holy fuck. Track that. I was eating 8 meals, each with 20g protein on double training days.
* I think, based on the weakness weds squat topic, women respond really well to volume and squat volume in general.
* To reiterate, I truly think my diet diligence was the key to success.

This was very long, it is my first review. Sorry for all the pictures, I don't have a powerlifting coach, so a lot of my training is video and self analysis and consulting the two awesome bros who spotted my squat. Any feedback or tips are always appreciated from the experienced and helpful people on this sub.

dpe3oj,weightroom,[Competition Report] Chicago Strength Strongman Challenge 10/26/19,"**My background**

I competed in my first strongman competition in September 2017, at the Central Illinois Strongman Classic. I was the only lightweight novice, so I won (and lost?) by default but had a ton of fun and wanted to get stronger so I could compete in the open category. I also knew I needed to move up to the Middleweight class in order to ever be competitive at a height of 6'.  In June 2018, I did an unsanctioned competition at the Iowa Games, which had novice-like weights, and I came in 3rd/6 at a weight of 186ish lbs. I still didn't feel strong enough for real open weights, so I spent another year getting stronger before competing in strongman again. I've also done two powerlifting meets, mostly recently competing in March 2019, getting an SBD of 468/292/485 @ 188 lbs BW. I've come to find training for powerlifting very boring and don't think that I'll compete in it again, though it is what got me into competitive strength sports. 

**Preparation**

Over the summer, I was able to train at a strongman gym and get lots of time with implements. I ran Brian Alsruhe's Mass Builder program and cultivated quite a lot of mass. At my heaviest, I was 205 lbs, a gain of almost 20 lbs in as many weeks. My strongman PRs over the summer included:

* 250 lb/hand farmer walk for 35 ft
* 600 lb yoke walk for 35 ft
* 15 ft. 320 lb shield carry
* 315 lb stone load
* 220 lb natural stone to shoulder
* 195 lb log press
* 215 lb axle clean

I had a ton of fun bulking hard and doing loads of strongman stuff, but I sadly had to leave my wonderful gym at the start of my next semester of school. This meant being back in a university gym with no implements besides a trap bar. I had put on quite a lot of fat, so I did a cut from August up until my competition with the goal of getting back below 198. This was my first-ever deliberate cut, and it was very easy. It turns out that reducing cutting snacks and weeknight drinking was enough for around 1 lb/week of weight loss. 

Programming-wise, I mostly winged it. I had two days a week with squatting and overhead pressing, one day a week for upper body accessories, and 1 day per week of deadlifting. I had very limited ability to actually practice the events for the meet, but did the best I could. I farmer carried a 480# trap bar about 100 ft and push pressed 225# for the first time one week out. I did some static holds with heavy weights on my back to simulate the yoke, getting 635 lbs for 30 seconds and 545 lbs for a minute. I tried out Zercher holds with a barbell to simulate the Conan wheel, but that didn't work all that well. I could only hold 365 for about 20 seconds before losing feeling in half of my left arm and deciding to stop so that I didn't injure myself. I rigged up a silly-looking ""deficit rack pull"" setup because that was the only way I could get a 15"" pull height to simulate the deadlift event and got 12 reps with quite a lot left in the tank. Overall, I was feeling pretty good about my preparation considering the equipment that I had access to. 

**Meet Goals:**

1. Don't come in last ‚úÖ
2. Get at least one clean on the log  ‚úÖ
3. Don't zero anything besides the log ‚úÖ

**Pre-meet stuff**

I got about 7 hours of sleep, which is pretty good for me. I had a small amount of coffee when I woke up so that I'd poop and be light enough to weigh in under 198. I prepped a huge smoothie, a bunch of black coffee, and a whole bunch of gatorade for my meet nutrition needs. I can never eat solid food when I compete- I just don't feel hungry at all, but I know I need calories and I can consume liquid calories without my stomach rebelling. I weighed in at 196#, and then was able to start mainlining coffee and smoothie. There ended up being a total of 5 MW competitors- two were 198s, and three were 220s. 

**Event 1: 230 lb Log Clean & Press for Reps**

[0 reps (3-way tie for last place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTAIJONAPYDyv-J3wTSt8S-kXZQhgoIE/view?usp=sharing)

I was second for this event, the guy ahead of me got 2 reps. Overhead pressing is far-and-away my biggest weakness, so I knew going in that this would be a zero. This log was over 30 lbs heavier than my log PR, and heavy even than my barbell strict press PR. The clean went surprisingly easy despite me not having touched a log in months. I just didn't have the strength to press the thing. I know that I don't have the greatest form with log- my elbows are way too low- but even then, I'm not strong enough to put up this weight. I set the log down and got two more cleans in, but wasn't remotely close on the press. Two of the other middleweights also couldn't get any reps- this was just really heavy. 

**Event 2: 420 lb Axle Deadlift for Reps**

[8 reps (5th place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ynC_JXnsrAWwkaa8p-PMK7sixQi_YXiw/view?usp=sharing)

This event was originally going to be from a 13-15"" height, but it got changed to from the floor. I was okay with this, since at such a high height, this would've been a cardio rep-fest for everyone. Straps were allowed, and I found that my regular straps were only barely long enough for me to wrap around the axle. Fortunately, we were allowed to strap in before the timer started- I easily spent 30+ seconds setting up my straps. Unfortunately, we had both up and down commands, so I effectively had to do dead stop deadlifts, which I never train. I was expecting to get 5-6 reps, and ended up getting 8. I did jump the up command on rep #3 and got a warning from the judge, so I had to slow down for the rest of them. I over-exaggerate the lockout on my deadlift, which I really need to stop doing as I'm sure it wastes a bunch of energy. Though this was a PR for me, the other competitors all got more reps than me, so I was sitting at last place overall.

**Event 3: ??? lb Conan Wheel**

[3/4 turn (3rd place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18OHz9J4aYZBTeRm0U81hiCnoZ_w1Sko0/view?usp=sharing)

I was really excited for this event, since I had never done it before. I don't know the weight, and I don't think the weight for this event is very meaningful since every Conan wheel setup has different geometry so you can't really compare them. But it was definitely sufficiently heavy. There was no time limit for the event, but no drops were allowed. Since the event was new to most of the competitors, we had quite a bit of time to practice ahead of time. This implement felt a lot better than the Zercher holds that I had done in prep- no losing feeling in my left forearm. I got a bunch of advice from fellow competitors on how to do it: try to look forward, and when you can't do that anymore, look up; keep moving; and ignore the voice in your head telling you to stop. I think I did a decent job doing all of that, though I would have liked to complete one whole revolution. This event just feels really heavy and draining. It didn't hurt during the event itself, but as soon as I dropped it, my vision started coning out, my hearing was muffled, and there was a ringing in my ears. I had to sit down for a while, but was fine after 5 minutes. It was taxing for sure, but I think a truck pull  is the best event for truly gassing you out. 

**Event 4: 600? lb Yoke + 230/hand Farmer's Medley**

[28.12 s (4th Place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K_d04ENZCTxfTsEDfEHI5_OL5dxmHF8o/view?usp=sharing)

This was a 50 foot medley. I'm not sure on the yoke weight, since the plan was for it to be 600, but I thought it felt lighter than that. We got to choose the order to do the medley in. I was more confident in the yoke, so I chose to do it first. I was a little out of practice on the yoke and I felt very slow, but I didn't have any drops. I messed up the pick on farmer's: you can see how the right handle was pointed slightly downwards, but the left handle was basically horizontal. This made me feel pretty unstable, but I managed to do the whole distance with no drops. My time was very close to the other competitors: only a 4.5 second spread in the top 4. I was only 0.14 seconds off of 3rd place. 

**Event 5: 237 lb Keg, \~210 lb Sandbag, \~200 lb Stone Carry and Load Medley**

[30.78 s (3rd Place)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12DyEB5O2yslsd1bq3jkLddnxQZWcNX8g/view?usp=sharing)

I had done carries and loads separately before, but never together. It showed in my technique- I had to regrip every implement when I got to the yoke to throw it over. I nearly was able to do it in a single motion with the sandbag, but wasn't quite there. I also dropped the stone, which I'm pretty disappointed about- this stone is way lighter than my best, but I guess I was tired. I was only a little more than a second behind third place. I see a ton of room for improvement here. I really want to practice this the next time I have access to implements.

**Wrap-up**

I placed 4/5 in the middleweights, and managed to meet all my goals for the competition. I'm really held back by my overhead pressing strength, and will have that as my main focus in my training. My technique for loading and picking definitely needs some work, but that'll have to wait until I'm able to regularly train somewhere with implements. In the meantime, I'm planning on doing a slow bulk and work on building up my strength throughout the winter. I'm looking forward to competing again next year. Towards the end of the year, I want to do a mock meet to test maxes. I know a 500 lb squat and deadlift are very close, as is a bodyweight strict press.",2019-10-30 22:32:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/dpe3oj/competition_report_chicago_strength_strongman/

*The meet*   
**Squats**  
Warm ups was not good, unracks felt heavy, after warming up past about 365lbs I was thinking Jesus don‚Äôt bomb, very fatigued mentally and physically. 1st attempt I was like okay I got this, 2nd attempt I got the shakes a bit but speed was fine again the unrack felt heavy and not confident, left shoulder was tight af couldn‚Äôt get feet facing forward. 3rd attempt I actually had the best unrack, no shakes, felt that happiness of like okay cool I got it, descent I felt good although heavy, got way too deep and couldn‚Äôt fight out of it. 99.9% of prep I felt good on squat till peak week when everything died. Started dealing with deep hip pain on the left side the past month or 2 and my new chiro on Friday did some soft tissue massage on the glute medius(?) and adductors that helped a bit at least on air squats, we noticed I have a very slight shift where my left side I believe was taking over and being overworked. No back pain today, didn‚Äôt even enter my mind, what if its completely caused mentally??

3rd - 235kg/519lbs miss    

**Bench Press**     
Warm up were really good, felt super relaxed, also super confident in the technical ease of it at times. Rolled out my back a ton and didn‚Äôt get the mid back cramps I typically do with heavy bench, moved super fast, good leg drive, consistent touching point. The attempt selection was perfectly fine, that was the best ive ever felt on bench descents (going ‚Äúfast‚Äù), I believe I had 177.5 in me, 175 was really fast, went for 182.5 as a 4th but couldn‚Äôt break the sticking point, still super confident going forward to hit a 410-440 bench in November.

**Deadlift**    
Warm ups felt somewhere between squats and bench, more towards bench. Not 10/10 but feeling good about what was going to happen assuming grip held. NO BACK PAIN FRICK YEAH. This one may be the most affected by intra prep fatigue and arousal. 515 in the gym will always feel pretty rough, in the meet I get legitimate laughs from my first two attempts with how fast they end up being comparatively to everyone else, even if it‚Äôs a weight I‚Äôve done maybe like 2-5 times ever. Time to just keep building on this with overall strength, glad I made the decision to take the easy 260 and at minimum walk out with a 20ish pound pr and higher wilks, didn‚Äôt even think about it till right before my 2nd attempt. This put me right outside the 2016 top 50 in the world, at the moment will be within the current top 50 but we‚Äôll see how that plays out throughout the year with powerlifting growing and people not getting any weaker, but hey neither am I.  

1st ‚Äì 232.5kg/512lb make

3rd - 260kg/573lb make AZ JR Total record https://instagram.com/p/BQrMp-OFUO3/    
4th - 267.5/589 miss barely broke floor  

*General notes:*   
1st- fuck that water cut, I know I can do it and its possible but that was quite literally top 5 hardest experience of my life and probably shaved a potential ~50lbs off my total, should‚Äôve just been more accountable with diet and walk around at like <190.   
2nd- first time dealing with adversity like that (a massive water cut, missing the squat, a somewhat BS bench fail) and didn‚Äôt let it affect the meet going forward, proud of that to an extent.       
3rd- was it a success? Hard to say, It was certainly an experience, PR‚Äôd in two lifts. Wilks improved, I learned a lot, learned how/when to take a smart 3rd attempt. Not trying to look too much on failures but what can I take away from mistakes that I can use in the future as a learning point. I think what would make this meet a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is if I learn from the failures. So this remains to be seen in my eyes and may be just a grey mark.  
4th- I set my personal goals for this meet way to high and set myself up for mental failure. Riding high off October I thought I was going to get 240/185/275 lol. Yeah no. when I realized that wasn‚Äôt going to happen my mental state went to shit quick till that self-realization kicked in of ‚Äúthat‚Äôs unreasonable to expect of someone else why would I expect myself to get that given that time range‚Äù     
5th - 10kg off a USPA elite total for the open class and 27.5kg off a junior intl elite total. http://i.imgur.com/jNtJbvt.png
 
**What do you feel went really well? Is there anything in particular that stood out to you?**   
Working through adversity, shit happens but cant let it ruin everything.

**Do you have an idea of your competition plans for the next 6-12 months? When are you thinking to compete next and at what bodyweight?**
IPL Worlds in November, 82.5, with much better body composition and overall conditioning, a lower walk around weight, get much bigger and stronger in the hips and legs, eliminate residual back pain, get more consistent in squat footing, cues, the overall movement. More consistent deadlift set up and start. Get an internationally competitive bench.

**Backgound:** I've been bodybuilding for a little over 5 years, doing a lot of low weight, high volume work on a ""bro"" split. Competed back in 2013, which was alright, and then again in 2014 and absolutely hated it - the dieting, the ""beauty contest"" aspect, the drugs, tan, everything. I almost completely quit lifting afterwards. A few weeks after my bodybuilding competition, I started seeing a girl who was relatively good at powerlifting (had a UK squat record) and it got me interested in lifting again. I'd been training ""powerlifting"" style for about 8 months, when some old guy at the gym stopped me and said ""No one [at the gym] cares how strong you are, and unless someone witnesses you lift, no one will believe or care about how much you say you lift. Sign up for a meet ASAP so you have your lifts in writing."" I signed up for this meet less than a week later.

**Training:** Before I decided to do this meet, I played around with 5/3/1 BBB for several months, tried (and failed) Mag-Ort, and then just did random stuff I found on the internet. Once I committed to the meet, I stuck to [this peaking program](http://muscleandbrawn.com/9-week-powerlifting-periodization-peaking-workout/) based off my previous 1RMs. For the first 6 weeks, I stuck to the program religiously, but decided to increase the 1-rep set amounts in weeks 7 and 8, because I thought the program was too light. I ended up setting squat and deadlift PRs in both weeks 7 and 8, then took the week leading up to the meet very light, only working up to a few sets at 50% on Saturday and Tuesday before the meet.

Training philosophy was to never get psyched up for a lift, never miss reps, never fail a lift, and to never ""grind"" a lift. I think this translated well to the meet, as I never had to mentally prepare or psych myself up for any of my attempts, and my form didn't really break for the most part.

**Meet:** Because this was my first meet, I had no idea what to expect. Everything ended up going very smoothly, and I managed to time my warm-ups and everything well.

Squats: Opened with 220/485 which went up easy, but I had the rack height too high, which made unracking the weight a challenge. Had it lowered for my second attempt, which was 237.5/522.5 (a 7lb PR for me) and also went up fairly easily. I had planned to do 242.5/534 for my third attempted, but since the 2nd attempt was easy, I decided to go with 245/540 (and also partly because it's what /u/flannel_smoothie did for his 3rd). That went up, but was more difficult, and you can see in the video that I didn't keep my torso as erect during the ascent and it went up much slower.


Bench: I hate bench, so I'll keep this short. Opened with 142.5/314 - easy. Second attempt was 152.5/336, which is my gym PR - easy. Third attempt was supposed to be 157.5/347, but I bumped it up to 160/352 so I could get a x2 BW bench. That was difficult and much slower, but it still felt smooth.


Deadlift: Opened with 235/518, which was well below my PR and went up effortlessly. Second attempt was going to be 255/561, but I bumped it up to 257.5/567 because I didn't realize how much the deadlift bar helped. 2nd attempt was a 12lb PR and also went up easy. For my third attempt, I was feeling pumped and wanted to see if I could break 600lbs, but also knew that it was only my first meet and that it's better to just go 9/9. So I went with 267.5/590, which was difficult, but I was able to get it without breaking form or grinding. And a 35lb PR isn't bad, even if I didn't have the guts to try for 600.


**Future Plans:** I qualified for USPA Nationals, IPL Worlds, and RUM with my total, and several people at the meet told me I should aim for national-level competition. But this was only my first meet, meaning I'm still inexperienced, and if I did a bigger meet, I'd want to be competitive in it, so for now I'm sticking to local/regional meets until I'm more comfortable. My next meet will likely be the USPA Maryland State Championships in August. My goal is to break a 600lb deadlift, and hopefully get a 1500+ total. The ""reach"" goal would be to break the state deadlift record, so that I can have 4/4 records for my weight class, but I'd need to get a 282.5/623 deadlift.",2015-04-28 16:09:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/34612u/xpost_meet_report_uspa_midatlantic_classic/

Saturday I knew I had to do something about my body cuz it wasn‚Äôt gonna get better by itself. In that rest week, I did nothing except get a deep tissue massage on Monday of rest week and Wednesday of rest week.

I was on a 500 cal deficit since Jan 2015, with some weeks of real fuck ups. Went from like 117-105. 

I didn‚Äôt believe that water loading would really work; if water loading down regulates vasopressin, negative feedback once you start dehydrating would very quickly with barely any time delay. Unless the vasopressin receptors are being destroyed, there would not be much delay between dehydration and water retention again. Anyone want to talk about this, I'm listening.

I planned on weighing in Friday at 9AM. I kept salt up and then tried to stay ‚Äúnormally hydrated‚Äù by drinking a bit more water than usual. On Wednesday, I cut sodium in half and cut down on carbs. On Thursday, I cut sodium as much as possible and ate almost no carbs. I only eat ~0.8g / lb BW of protein usually, and kept this up throughout my weight cut because protein and carbs both store more water than fat does. Also, I upped my calories to a bit over maintenance to prevent any ounce of muscle loss by adding like 5 tablespoons of olive oil. [Here‚Äôs the MFP entries.](http://imgur.com/a/HVQHt#0) 
I finished said liquid meal/ ‚Äúsmoothie‚Äù at noon and also quit drinking water until the next morning at 9am. 
I'll give gold to the next redditor who cuts water weight using my method.

I brought my scale from home with me out of curiosity. Turns out my home scale weighs people 0.5kg lighter than the official scale. 

Weighed in with clothes on at 47.6kg, or 104.94lbs, for the 105.75lb weight class

Ate mostly carbs and little protein and fat the whole day to replenish glycogen stores.

On meet day, I had a Denny‚Äôs Grand Slam for breakfast cuz I got up at 6, just forced myself to eat carbs during the meet: white bread, PB2, Nutella, Nature Valley bars, and I made a new friend who had the small Hostess powdered sugar doughnuts. The doughnuts were the only the only thing palatable on a nervous stomach, actually, so I‚Äôm glad I learned that for next time. I had a protein shake after deadlifts. Then sushi and alcohol.


**Meet**

Squat

[155lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb0T-epvTrQ) ‚Äì good lift

[160lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAi4zg45OdY) ‚Äì good lift, I was not centered so it was pretty effing rough. Also the back spotter advised me to lower my rack height cuz I struggled on the first attempt too. I thought I just really sucked at racking and unracking so that was helpful to know.

[170lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCROh5cPhPE) ‚Äì red lighted for downward movement. 


I originally wanted to do 155 / 170 / 180 but taking 2 weeks off squatting (last last Monday was my last squat day), I really feel like I kind of forgot how the movement goes. It was probably too long of a break for me esp since I haven‚Äôt been lifting that long. I should‚Äôve just done some light work or something, idk. I was surprised that 170 was hard at all because I did 165 x 5 with energy to spare on the last heavy squat day. I probably would‚Äôve started pushing harder before the grinding point but I really did not think that this attempt would be that bad.

Bench

[83.7lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TByAYefgRU0) ‚Äì good lift. I wanted to open with 85 cuz I can do 85 x 6 pretty easily but my max is like 90 lbs. But I can‚Äôt pick 85 in kg and the choice was 88lbs, which was too close to my max and I didn‚Äôt wanna bomb out

[92.5 lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGAESE0F-Jg) ‚Äì butt came off bench when beginning to push the bar off my chest. I mean it didn‚Äôt but I don‚Äôt have discernible glutes and they look like my hamstrings and etc etc also a lot of other people got called for butt off the bench so I‚Äôm not even mad about it

[92.5 lbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6YmrOJed1k)- too weak

DL

My friends were all having shitty lift days and I was feeling kind of nervous in general because I wasn‚Äôt doing as well as I wanted to. Warm ups felt super heavy and I wanted to open with 210, then end with 235 (my max in December was 223) but I got scared cuz I didn‚Äôt want to bomb out. Lowered my opener from 210 to 195 lbs because I was scared as shit; also, I feel like I haven‚Äôt been lifting long enough to know what deadlift weight I can do ‚Äúfor a triple on a bad day‚Äù, esp with Candito‚Äôs 6 week strength program where I rarely do the actual deadlift (there‚Äôs a lot of deadlift variations so I did hella block pulls though).
I did something like 

[195](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9zPaMAbDEM)

[205](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4zpT9uRdik) (wanted to move this attempt up after I gave it but they said you can only change your opener after you give it)

[210](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ogRLAniiE) (just got scared and didn‚Äôt want to go higher)

Then after, turned up with alcohol and got annoyed I didn‚Äôt PR deadlift and[ pulled 225lbs 2 hours later](https://instagram.com/p/17LEd-oR5i/?taken-by=alice.hwang) in the basement gym of some new friends I made at the meet (non calibrated plates etc etc)



And I feel like I‚Äôm good for 235 or something so I am probably going to the gym to try it Tuesday or Wednesday lmaooo


**Thoughts**

I think I totaled similar to what I did in December at 115lbs except DL.

I think not training the competition deadlift as often as the squat/bench really messed with my confidence. I am pretty sure I have the strength to do way more, but it just freaked me out that the bar was moving slow and it was hard. Even though that‚Äôs probably normal. I guess I‚Äôm not really used to grinding out deadlifts as much as grinding out a squat or bench. I forgot like, it‚Äôs SUPPOSED to be hard, and yeah my last 210 attempt I could probably at least triple but I just got scared in picking attempts.


open to program recommendations now. I might go on a 5x3 to make sure I'm not missing any linear gainzzZZz",2015-04-28 13:54:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/345jd4/meet_report_452lbs_at_105lbs_or_2055kg_at_48kg/

**Training: Two Months Out**

Finished up Jacked & Tan while in Afghanistan then kinda played it by ear, so to speak, until I got back stateside. Went on leave for 3-weeks, then came back to work and began training regularly again.

For the month of September I basically did the 3rd meso-cycle of [Jacked & Tan](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/06/15-weeks-of-jacked-tan-results.html), but heavier. So ascending sets of 4 and 2 reps rather than 6 and 4. This sort of changed as I approached meet day since my energy levels were adjusting with my dieting and my work schedule was hectic. 

Training-wise that's more or less that's what I did with some minor changes.

**One Week Out**

Worked up to some fairly easy reps of: 

Squat: 425x1 (got a little funky so I dropped it down to 405x2 easy)

Bench: 315x1 paused (was going to do a 295 rep out but was feeling good, tested 315 with a good pause. Felt confident with it. Then did 295x2 I think.)

Deadlift: 525x3 (Matched my previous personal record.)

These gave me rough ideas of where my strength was standing so I could more accurately decide openers and test them the week of the meet. 

As this was a feeler meet for me that I simply needed to do to qualify for IPL World's where I was then planning on qualifying for Raw Unity 8 I wasn't too worried about going to heavy. I didn't want to crush myself in the gym at this point. Nor did I want to give 100% on the platform because I felt that I wasn't yet strong enough to qualify for Raw Unity.

Turns out I was barely strong enough to do so...

**Dieting and Water Manipulation**

About a month out I was weighing in the upper 170's, around 177-178 on average. So three weeks out I started dieting down. I do this mainly through cutting carbs and not worrying about anything else. Just try to eliminate the ""junk"" in my diet. We're talking beer and the usual tasty stuff: Rice, breads, potatoes, pasta, tasty treats. 

Two weeks out and the carb cutting got a bit more serious. At this point in time I was still eating a burrito a day but had made sure it was simply a ton of meat wrapped up in a tortilla; which is usually 50-75g of carbs. This was when I had started to aim to gradually lower carbohydrate consumption to lower than 100g per day. 

One week out I was aiming for as close to 0g per day of carbs as possible. In order to keep my energy high I ensured I was consuming enough fat. I did this at first through eating whole cottage cheese and drinking 1/2 and 1/2 with my protein shakes. Then cut it back to eating more eggs per day. We're talking a bare minimum of two, average of 4-6 per day for about a week. This plus cheese kept my fats high, and therefore, my energy was too. 

As I was only sitting about 10-12 pounds higher than 165 I didn't require a serious amount of water manipulation. So I didn't worry so much about pounding water and sodium the week of the meet as per usual with my previous weight cuts. All I did was simply eat fewer and fewer carbs gradually over the course of the month and the Monday before weigh-ins I was sitting at a pretty 169-171 pounds or so. 

The week of the meet I simply ate less and less. Made sure I was drinking 150-200 ounces of fluids per day. And then come Thursday before weigh-ins I had 20oz of Diet Mountain Dew and a Quest bar for breakfast. Didn't drink anything or eat anything at all for the rest of the day. Spit all night while coaching then weighed myself that evening at /u/NolanPower 's house and was 164.

Awesome. I could eat and drink a bit before bed. So I had a little carne asada fries, a Reese peanut butter cup, and a protein shake and BAM... 165 lb. on the money. Went to sleep comfortable and ready for weigh-ins.

**Weigh Ins**

Took place the day prior the meet. Got to Metro Flex at 9:30 am and didn't step on the scale until 11:45. Shit took forever. One scale. Tons of lifters. The only benefit to this was that since the gym was a goddamned furnace I kept sweating and losing more and more weight. This on top of spitting the 1.5 hour drive up ensured I'd make weight easily. Stepped on the scale at 163 +change. 

Barely dehydrated as I had 24oz of fluid when I woke up. 

Seriously though... that damn gym was hotter than a sauna in hell. 

**Post Weigh Ins**

Pounded a Pedialyte to be sure I was good to go on the hydration side of the house. Then my family and I drove to Slater's 50/50 in Huntington Beach and I ate the following:

1/2 lb. Slater's 50/50 burger (This is 50% ground beef, 50% ground bacon, avocado, and a fried egg.)

Fried macaroni and cheese balls

Fried pickles

Chocolate, banana, and peanut butter shake 

40oz of Coke

At this point I had become Wilford Brimley.

On the way to the hotel we stopped by a grocery store where I bought snacks for the meet and I got a 32oz Pina Colada smoothie which I pounded.

I looked like fucking Octomom. 

Got to the hotel. Relaxed a bit in the hot tub and worked on building an appetite. Around 10:30 pm I went to In and Out and ate the following:

Double double animal style

Animal fries

Large strawberry shake

1/2 Chocolate shake (Wife couldn't finish hers so I did.)

Went to sleep weighing around 172-something. 

**Meet Day**

Got there a bit early. Drank 1/2 a Pedialyte then the other 1/2 I mixed with C4 and began stretching and warming up for squats. The weather was cool in the morning so I was feeling pretty good about the day. (Since this time the day prior it was balls hot in the gym.) It did however get hotter and hotter as the day grew. By the time deadlifts came around it was miserable. 

Lifting started at 9:15 or so and my first squats didn't go down until about 10:00.

**Squats**

**1st Attempt:** 407 (Good Lift) Felt easy. I usually play it safe of my first attempts. 

**2nd Attempt:** 424 (Good Lift) Easier than the 425 the week prior.

**3rd Attempt:** 440 (Good Lift) Set up awkward on my back. Right side drifted up towards my neck as I was standing. Felt harder than it should have. But still got it with somewhat ease and a little grind 1/2 way up. 

**Bench Press**

**1st Attempt:** 286 (Good Lift) Originally called for 290-something but got a little worried about it. So I decided to play it safe and cut my opener to 286. During warm ups I had done 275x1 for two sets. But just wanted to play it safe and not bomb out like an idiot. 

**2nd Attempt:** 308 (Good Lift) Feeling good and having got the bench-jitters out of me I got the 2nd attempt easy. About as quick as the 1st attempt.

**3rd Attempt:** 319 (Good Lift) This was fairly hard but I got it clean. Feel good about it. Little to no grind. 

At this point in time I was feeling really good and began calculating what I'd have to do with the deadlift to qualify for IPL Worlds. Then it turned out with a 584 pull I could hit the exact total I needed to qualify for Raw Unity 8; my dream goal for the meet. So I set my sights on that. I knew it would be hard. But I knew I had it in me. Warm ups went amazing and I was getting all kinds of looks as I was manhandling 315, 365, 405, and 455 with more speed than Old Dirty Bastard had ever experienced. 

People were like, ""Who the fuck is this guy?""

**Deadlift**

**1st Attempt:** 507 (Good Lift) Cake walk. Easy opener. Secured the win in my weight class, barring anyone being a better deadlifter than I.

**2nd Attempt:** 540 (Good Lift) A little slow off the floor but locked it out nicely. This secured the win.

**3rd Attempt:** 584 (Good Lift) This kills the competition... Needed this to qualify for Raw Unity 8. Completing this lift would give me the exact qualifying total for that meet so I was *very* excited that I completed it. Also, this put me within range of having a 4th attempt... 

**4th Attempt:** 600 (No Lift) Only granted when going for records. Attempted 600 to break the California State record of 589. Didn't get it as it got stuck at my knees. Excuses are: 1. It was hot as fuck. 2. I just did 584. 3. Fucking 600 is heavy, dude.  All excuses aside... I'll get it next time.

**Total: 1,344 and change. Won my weight class. Not sure how I stand overall. Will wait for meet results on that.**

All in all, it was a great meet. The negatives were that the location was hot as a mother fucker. Other than that, it was awesome. There were a number of food vendors and the crowd was HUGE and involved. Place got loud for a few of us, including me, so that was awesome. The only things I felt that the USPA could improve on was having more scales for weigh-ins because waiting over an hour to get your weight is sort of silly. 

But really... that's a fairly sorry complaint. 

**Moving Forward**

Since I was originally planning to use this meet to qualify for IPL World's,  then go there to qualify for RUM8, I'm still going to do the IPL World's next month in Las Vegas. But rather than worry about simply qualifying for RUM8 I'm going to try and get a 1,400+ total in the 165 pound weight class. As of right now I stand #19 for total on PowerliftingWatch.com's current rankings. I'd like to break the top-10. Ideally a 450+ wilks at IPL Worlds would be awesome. 

Raw Unity 8 is next January or February so I'm planning on doing that. If I don't break 1,400 at IPL World's I'll do it there and if all goes well leading up to RUM8 I'll be closing on 1,450. Fucking stoked. 

**Wrap Up**

Met a few other redditors there at the meet. Guys were awesome and I enjoyed talking with them between lifts. Afterwards we went to Buffalo Wild Wings and crushed it. Had a blast during the meet with you guys and afterwards as well. Hopefully in the future we can all lift together and get more beers and wings. The meet went much better than I anticipated and I credit my performance in the crazy heat to my training in Afghanistan the months prior.  All I was thinking was, ""Well, at least it's not as hot as Afghanistan."" Set my mind right for when I stepped on the platform.

After being a curl/bench bro in college, I decided to look around for programs with actual substance. I picked starting strength exactly 6 months ago today (6/29/11) and I wanted to share my results.

My numbers are a bit off, since I hardly ever did squats before, and NEVER deadlifted or did cleans before this program. That's why the numbers went up so much.

I saved you guys the trouble of going to [the Strength Standards page](http://i.imgur.com/x6Cko.jpg).

I've been using the bench press as a measure of my strength, and it's been ridiculous. I gained an average of 11 pounds a month. I'm starting to plateau on everything, and I have 5/3/1 lined up to replace Starting Strength. My book arrived 3 days ago.

My weight when I started was around 200, it is now 224. I'd say a LOT of that is fat, but eating a crapload of food will do that to you. 

I am 23, 5'10""

If anyone is interested in my diet, prepare to be disappointed. It is not strict by any means (probably not that healthy either).

I drink 2-3 gallons of milk a week (If you're on the fence about this, DO IT. HOLY CRAP, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON)

sandwiches (whole wheat + lean ham +cheese + mustard = YUM)

cucumbers,tomatoes with cheese

banana+strawberry+almond+oatmeal+protein powder smoothies

That sounds sort of healthy, but don't be fooled. I eat a lot of crap too. I don't care what I eat as long as I also get a lot of protein, carbs, and healthy fats.


Also, correct my form if you see a problem! I want to avoid injuries!

Updated the numbers! Hopefully I qualify for flair now! (At 226 lbs)


Edit at 1/15/2012: I am still 226, and just [OHP 255 for 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7zQ2RLtTzM). I would like my elite OHP flair, and I'll get my elite bench later this week (hopefully)
