1mvlohj,nutrition,"Does Anyone Actually Eat the ""Standard American Diet""?","How regularly do you encounter people who eat the stereotypical Standard American Diet: only burgers, fries, fast food, frozen dinners, sugary sodas/drinks, processed meats, and refined grains like white bread and white rice, with barely any veggies or fruit?

I get that‚Äôs how the diet is often described in studies or articles, but I don‚Äôt know anyone who eats that way all the time. Most people I know might eat junk food/fast food sometimes, but they also cook at home, have fruit in the house, or make an effort to balance things out.

1mtp3vq,gainit,"Male 5'7"" 17 years old, 59kg to 71kg. 2 years progression","So first picture me(in the middle ofc) 2 years ago(2023), I was approximately 59kg(130lbs). Second picture I am now(2025) 17 years old, 71kg(158lbs). Third picture is my admiration, Serge Nubret, the physique l'm trying to achieve, but I don't train like him lol.

Ik 2 years seem a bit long to achieve a physique like that but in the first year I left the gym to do MMA but on the mid year, I was fully committed to be a bodybuilder, and I also want to compete!
I'm still in School I'm a student, I love 70s-80s music and its lifestyle.

I train like Mike Mentzer(lf i did train like Nubret I'd probably lose all of my gains as natural).
So my routine/schedule is like this(while on a bulk):

Day 1: Chest and Back
Day 2: Rest
Day 3: Legs and Calves
Day 4: Rest
Day 5: Rest
Day 6: Shoulders, Triceps, Biceps and Forearms
Day 7: Rest

On Day 1 and Day 6, I hit abs before starting the following muscles parts and if im on a cut I train 5 times a week and also on cuts everyday I do abs except on leg days. But everyday after a workout I hope on the treadmill when cutting, leaving only Saturday and Sundays as Rest days
.
This is my routine(on a cut):
Day 1: Chest, Biceps and Forearms
Day 2: Legs and Calves
Day 3: Back, Triceps and Forearms
Day 4: Shoulders
Day 5: Rest
Day 6: (Lacking Muscles, I hit the muscles that I lack the muscles important for Aesthetic, for example Shoulders, Forearms, Calves, AND IK I LACK A LOT OF CALVES LOL.) 

About my Diet, on a BULK I eat everything i can, it can be clean and junk food(but not always junk food, its rare but not never.), I try to keep the calorie surplus every week and also as a boy staying with his mom I can't refuse what my mother prepared for dinner so I also keep that bulky during dinner I try to eat as much I can. And usually on bulks, the supplements that I take are Creatine and Tongkat Ali.
On a cut, its different, I eat clean, eliminate 100% of the junk food not even cheat days, and I also try to tell my mom what to cook during dinners and also what to prepare for school breaks. On cuts the supplement I take is usually protein shakes, Isolate Protein Powder, as on cuts Im on calorie deficit and need to lose fat, and when you‚Äôre eating fewer calories, it‚Äôs easy to also eat less protein without realizing. The problem is, if I don‚Äôt get enough protein, I risk losing muscle mass along with fat. The protein shake helps me hit my daily protein goal without adding too many extra calories. It‚Äôs basically a convenient way to protect my muscles while I‚Äôm cutting.

I don't want to chase a ""Mass-Monster"" like physique, I prefer classique physiques, aesthetic! And ofc l'm fully into Golden Era bodybuilding, I love it! *ITS ALL ABOUT THE 70s-80s!*",2025-08-18 15:23:36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mtp3vq
1mv525e,loseit,Healthy delivery options for someone bed-bound and can‚Äôt cook,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm currently bed-bound due to my weight (435+ lbs) and cooking isn‚Äôt really an option for me at the moment. Because of this, I rely almost entirely on food delivery. I can afford to order every day, but I‚Äôm looking for ways to make healthier choices instead of just relying on typical fast food or junk food.

I‚Äôm not really a fan of frozen ready meals, so I‚Äôm hoping to find delivery options that are fresher or closer to ‚Äúreal food,‚Äù but still convenient and manageable given my limited mobility. My main goal is to eat meals that are a bit more nutritious, maybe lower in calories or higher in protein and fiber, without having to cook myself.

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who has experience with healthy delivery options, meal prep services that cater to people who can‚Äôt cook, or even specific dishes from restaurants that tend to be more filling but not overly processed.

1m9huzg,healthyeating,I don't feel like eating healthy is helping me.. why?,"I decided I will eat healthy since I have very bad skin issues and scalp issues.  
I started with a 5 day fasting to clean my inner body.  
Before my fasting I was 72kg, after fasting I've got 67kg.

After eating healthy for 2 months I can say that nothing has changed that much. I even lost more kg, now I am 65kg.... ( and since I am 185cm tall I suppose 75kg would be at least the best with muscles on my body... )  
I worked out hard for 6 months straight to gain weight and muscles (which I did).. I ate everything and let me tell you, literally everything from healthy breakfasts to snacks after dinner... I was feeling better and looking better. I saw the results in the mirror.

Now, since I am eating healthy, all my motivation is gone. I am not working out anymore (only doing some push ups and pull ups, that's it).. I would not say I feel much better than before.. I just had a walk in the morning and all I was wishing is to eat some biscuits with black tea... suffering.

Yesterday I experimented with removing carbs and fruits (did it for only one day, but as soon as I woke up my scalp is still feeling bad, it is very itchy so seems like it is not the carbs that triggers my issues with my scalp)... I supposed if I will not eat carbs for one day at least I will not get itchy scalp in the morning which is a good sign.. Well, it is still itchy.  
Now I am thinking to remove meat ( I eat only beef since from my 2021 intolerance test I was positive for all other meats except beef) for a few days... but idk.. is it worth it? I don't think so... I am losing hope...

I thought eating healthy will improve my skin issues, but it doesn't.... I am really thinking about to go to the shop and buy some snacks and just don't care about it at all....  
I would not say I feel much better since I am eating healthy..  
I miss eating burgers, I miss ketchup, I miss mayo, I miss chips, I miss chocolate, I miss biscuits, I miss sandwiches, I miss bread, I miss orange juice.... I even don't eat eggs anymore... I miss eating 4-5 eggs in the morning and have energy.. I miss working out too...  
I am losing it.. really..

EDIT: what I mean by eating healthy

***fruits***¬†\- banana, apple, dragon fruit, berries, mandarins, oranges  
(during winter I ate watermalon, I miss it soo much... but maybe I have intolerance to it, idk..)  
(stopped since yesterday but don't feel change on my scalp)

***Nuts***¬†*-*¬†omg.. i love pistacchios and mixes... stopped as It might trigger acne too..

***Vegetables***¬†\- I am eating it all except tomato and carrot as a test from 2021 said I am intolerance.. Mostly Salads and Cucumber

***Green juice***¬†\- kale, ice, honey, banana, mint, cucumber, avocado, water

***Morning and Evening tea***¬†\- hot ginger turmeric mint tea

***Dairy***¬†\- I love cheese and kefir... stopped for a week with kefir tho as I thought it might trigger acne.. seems like maybe not

***Meat***¬†\- ONLY BEEF steak and minced

***Carbs***¬†\- potato and rice.. sometimes pasta (stopped since yesterday but don't feel change on my scalp)

NO processed and junk food at all..  
***I take my supplements***¬†*- mega D, zinc , omega 3, spirulina, chlorella (stopped B vitamin from yesterday as someone said it might trigger the acne but actually, I had the acne without the supplements too so it doesn't matter...*",2025-07-26 02:20:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1m9huzg/i_dont_feel_like_eating_healthy_is_helping_me_why/

1mtz5ul,keto,I never would have thought my grandfather would introduce me to keto,"I am 25 years old I work in an office and my diet could be summarized as a coffee to start a quick sandwich at lunch and junk food to keep me going in the afternoon. I was always tired unable to concentrate for more than 30 minutes.

Last weekend I was at my grandparents' and I was complaining about my fatigue. My grandfather an old school guy was listening to me nodding his head.

At one point he told me Your problem is that you're trying to heat your house by burning newspaper.

I didn't understand right away.

He continued The sugar and the fast stuff you eat it's like paper or twigs It makes a big flame right away it heats strongly for five minutes and then poof there's nothing left but ashes And you're cold again so you have to put more paper in again and again.

Then it started to make sense.

What you need he said tapping on the table is a good oak log It's harder to light but once it's going it gives you a gentle and constant heat for hours without you needing to tend to it.

This image of the log (proteins good fats) versus the newspaper (sugar) completely blew my mind.

When I got home I started to dig into the subject. I used a [TDEE Calculator ](https://lean-app.com/tdee-calculator/)to get a rough idea of the ""log size"" I needed for my day but it was mostly my grandfather's image that guided me.

It's been barely three weeks since I changed the way I eat. I replaced sweets with almonds I eat more complete meals with vegetables and proteins. The result is crazy. I no longer have the afternoon slumps. My energy is no longer a straw fire it's an ember that lasts all day.

The strangest feeling is no longer having those cravings that drove me crazy. It's a calm background energy. Not the excitement spike from sugar. It's just mega solid.

Anyway I wanted to share this little story. Sometimes the best nutritional advice doesn't come from books or from friends but sometimes from the person you least expect a grandfather and his campfire story.",2025-08-18 21:29:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mtz5ul/i_never_would_have_thought_my_grandfather_would/

However his wife is reluctant to go vegan, so my thoughts process was if you push her wife, when she already views veganism poorly, it will be more off putting so for health reasons he should slowly substitute bad processed food with healther alternative. And build up in slow increments.

So I commented
""If it's purely health reasons. Vegan diet is not any healthier than eating meat. Why do you think Japanese live long when they consume fish and meats?
What is the difference between your vegan diet previously and your current diet? Are you eating more junk food? Are you eating less fruits and veggies?
Changing everything drastically is difficult, and probably why your wife is hesitant. Try small. Instead of ice cream try yogurt with fresh berries. Instead of deep-fried food. Try air fry or pan fry. Small things overtime will stack up.""


Some guy responded with ""The ideal vegan diet is not healthier than the ideal meat eater diet, but I would expect the average vegan diet to be healthier than the average american diet. Simple reason for this, vegan food tastes worse and so you eat less of it. Very effective weight loss technique.""

So I replied ""You need nutrition, especially when you get older. Not eating is great for weight loss. But only weight loss. 

Omega 3 from fish oil is great supplement when you're getting older. Now yes vegan is great for that. But if you can also become junk vegan. I believe the key is eating less processed food. And more balanced diet..

But then again this is vegan sub Reddit. So this will probably get downvoted...""

1) differences in people's gut biomes play a huge role in their general health

2) Some treatments involve biome transplants, which suggests that turning the tide in your gut biome makeup might be extremely difficult through diet alone.

3) Someone getting serious antibiotic treatment can often end up wiping out huge portions of their existing gut biome, possibly even creating a blank slate to rebuild on 

So I'm wondering... when someone has to get on a lot of antibiotics, is this an opportunity to relatively easily rebuild their gut biome to be a more healthy selection, by being extra disciplined with what they eat for a little while?

If someone for whom it is hard to curb junk food cravings did that, is there a chance they will eventually crave all the leafy greens, and generally dislike things like candy?

1. DRINK MORE WATER. When you wake up, when you want a snack, when you‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôre actually hungry or bored. Due to primitive survival instincts our minds have a hard time distinguishing between hunger and thirst. There‚Äôs nothing healthier than water!!!

2. WILL POWER DOESNT WORK. You know who has the strongest will power ? - the people who avoid it. Don‚Äôt buy a pint of Ben and Jerry‚Äôs if you know you‚Äôll eat it in one day. Don‚Äôt keep junk food in the house if you can‚Äôt help but binge. If I need ice cream, I buy an ice cream bar (not a tub) Know yourself, work with yourself, avoid having to use ‚Äúwill power‚Äù

3. AVOID PROCESSED FOODS! Is it full of preservatives? Is it ten steps away from something that grows in nature? Stay away!!! You can still be a lazy or cheap eater and keep it natural. Try nuts, eggs, canned or jarred foods. Find inspiration at your local farmers market. Check ingredients!!

4. FIND YOUR FAVORITE SEASONINGS. You don‚Äôt need to be a good cook if you have good seasoning. My favorite is Everything But The Bagel seasoning from Trader Joe‚Äôs. I put it on everything.

5. FIND JOY IN EATING HEALTHY. Make colorful dishes, thank yourself before every meal, splurge on a water bottle you love. For example, I made my morning smoothie my daily ritual. It is part of my meditation each day. I associate my healthy habit with self love!!

However the past couple of weeks I‚Äôve started becoming absolutely disgusted at the thought of eating processed foods, greasy foods, etc. so I have refused.

If anything I should still gain a few pounds. However, chicken and rice with some veggies gets old pretty quick.

As a beginner it‚Äôs so incredibly overwhelming trying to eat healthy when I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and don‚Äôt like spending a lot of time cooking and eating to begin with. I‚Äôve literally been stressed out for the past hour thinking because I really don‚Äôt want to fall back into the cycle of junk food.

Hi all!

I have an everyday diet that‚Äôs probably a mixture of upbringing and mental blocks. I have a food palette that is exceptionally small. If you have ever seen the posts of ‚ÄúCount how many things you won‚Äôt eat‚Äù, I‚Äôm consistently in the 75%+ range of not eating it. This is pretty limiting to what I can make and it is very difficult to have a healthy diet with what I currently eat.

I need to start systematically introducing new foods into my diet, and I need help choosing foods to start this. I kinda want to have one thing that I focus on at a time and I want to start with things that would have a higher chance of me developing a liking to them quickly.

szhqzb,HealthyFood,"""Healthy"" Food Perks for the Workplace Culture?","Hello,

Our CEO has tasked me with coming up with a food-centric perk for our 71-employee location.

In the past, we had a ""cereal bar"" ([image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2078/6445/products/KCH-06151_LS01_3000px_3000x.jpg?v=1569117596))¬†‚Äì I managed the whole thing, the dispensers, ordering the cereal and milk, replenishing the cereal/milk, cleaning it; but also, soliciting employees for cereal preferences. I kept this up for at least a year or so. It was *fun* while it lasted, but looking back on it, it isn't the healthiest. I expressed this to our CEO, and he agrees we could use a healthier version of a ""cereal bar."" (More importantly, less time-consuming.)

He suggested an idea for fruit delivery service to our break rooms ‚Äì something like [Fruit That Works](https://fruitguys.com/office-fruit-delivery/) or [SnackNation](https://snacknation.com/office-fruit-delivery/) ‚Äì but his initial concern is that he doesn't want people taking the fruit with them to their homes and families, in place of grocery shopping. The idea is to boost employee morale and retention, you know? Keep us happy (and ideally healthy) while working. His idea is perhaps we can set a rule that employees must only eat the food on site? We both feel like that's mostly unenforceable.

We already have snack food vending machines (albeit being junk food), soda vending machines, an espresso/coffee machine (free), and filtered water dispensers (free).

We're in NC, USA.

Open to all ideas!

Bonus points for talking about your own ""healthy"" work place food perks! 

Also, what's your food perk wish list?

Thanks!",2022-02-23 13:40:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/szhqzb/healthy_food_perks_for_the_workplace_culture/

qkio5h,HealthyFood,Healthy lunch suggestions for someone who doesn't like fruit and veg,"So I grew up with my lunches being sandwiches with crisps, a chocolate biscuit, just basic snacks, maybe an apple. Now, I'm 22 and that's really all I ever do or have ever done for lunch. I want to start ditching random snacks and junk food as being part of my daily lunch so I guess what I'm really looking for is suitable sides to go with sandwiches.

Unfortunately I'm a very picky eater. Like to the point where most people find it ridiculous. I don't like any fruit besides apples and grapes (I'm usually happy with most fruit juices but even there I default to apple. Strawberries I wouldn't pick for myself but would eat them if they were the only thing in front of me). I have tried mixing them with things like cereal but nope, I just can't.

Vegetables I actually do like but they have to be cooked and hot, cold or raw veg I cannot stomach for the life of me. I'm not just being fussy here, I made a chicken salad one day and could barely keep myself from throwing up with every bite. On weekends I can just do two hot meals a day, no problem there but during the week when I need to do packed lunch I'm really struggling to come up with much.Any google searches always take me straight to salads so I'm kind of finding it difficult.

In short, I want healthy sides to go with sandwiches that can be eaten cold that aren't vegetables. I already eat apples and grapes with my sandwiches but I'm still left craving more. 

I guess off the top of my head I'm thinking pasta, maybe eggs and pre-cooked meat. I've tried nuts in the past but don't particularly like them and in the end settled for having peanut butter in my sandwiches. I can get my fill of veg during my evening meal and with fruit juice I'm still getting three portions of fruit a day plus a few portions of veg so I don't think I'm lacking anything.

EDIT: Does anyone know if dried fruit is sufficient, pair those with apples, grapes, strawberry and some other fruit juice and I might have fruit covered.

But then one day I had a day off from work and I started feeling sick.... And hungry. Even tho I ate I still was hungry and having big cravings like never before. I wanted to vomit, was grumpy, lower back pain, couldn't even bend my back to put my shoes on. Didn't know what was going on. I was stuck in my bed and could barely move cus of me feeling sick and was in back pain. I was starving and didn't care about eating healthy cus I couldn't make anything. So I just had someone buy me McDonald's and no lie, I felt normal again and my back pain was mostly gone. I realized I went through junk food withdrawals. Didn't know this was a thing. No one told me this part of quiting cold turkey. Lol. I realized within that moment that eating healthy is going to be harder than I thought. I also realized why for that first week I didn't notice any withdrawals. And I believe it was because I was busy working delivering mail (I'm a mailman). My mind was busy at work. But when I wasn't working, I'm doing nothing at home, I couldn't help but notice how much I felt like shit. So I think I can eat healthy as long as I'm working to keep my mind off it.  But as soon as I'm not working and I'm not busy, I noticed my withdrawals and have to eat junk food to feel better. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what did you do?

nbsbwb,HealthyFood,Beginners Advice- Vegetarian bowls?,"Hi All,

&#x200B;

Hoping you guys can help me out. Ive been vegetarian most of my life, but for those of you who assume its a healthy lifestyle i can attest that no, theres a lotta junk food involved (especially in my diet). Im 35 and have been eating unhealthy all my life (mostly due to the fact that my parents didnt have a good understanding of nutrition and i grew up without one). It recently started getting worse this past year. Mostly due to work being very hectic, i run a factory and will usually leave for work at 5 am, get back home around 4pm exhausted and wind up vegetating on the couch. As a result most of my diet this past year has been fast food. Ive occasionally cooked for myself but for the most part ive been relying on uber eats. This has both emptied my wallet and bloated my stomach (not much more than it was before, but i was already pretty fat). 

&#x200B;

Im looking to finally break this cycle and have decided to put my foot down and stop eating out completely. Trouble is i need to make something thats reasonably healthy and quick to throw together (or something that takes a while but will last a week, that way i can cook a big batch on the weekend and itll last me for the week).

&#x200B;

This past week ive experimented with food bowls. Basically i just cut up a bunch of veggies, cheese (and also added some canned beans, beetroot and chickpeas) and threw them in a big tupperware container. Throughout the week ive been cooking rice and making one bowl for dinner, whilst preparing another one for lunch the next day (or somethimes just throwing it in a wrap). Ive been mostly dressing this with fresh lemon juice and thousand island dressing though i do plan to mix it up and use tahina, bbq sauce, hummous and a few other different sauces to add some variation to the flavour (just to keep me from getting bored with it and going back to uber eats)

&#x200B;

So far the first week has passed and its been a success, i have gone to mcdonalds for breakfast once this week (also swung by hungry jacks for a coke, which im also trying to quit), but thats still a huge improvement on my normal weeks (not uncommon for me to have a mcbreakfast 5 days out of the week). The only thing im considering doing different is adding broccoli and chopped kale to the next batch (and maybe using fetta instead of cheddar, again mostly just to mix up the flavours a bit)

&#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone has recommendations for other veggies i should be considering (so far just using peas, lettuce, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes and cucumbers, as well as canned chickpeas, beans and beetroot). I love absolutely every veggie except satans cucumber (aka zucchini). Or if there are any easy/lazy recipes that will last a while in the fridge/freezer and wont be too time consuming to prepare.

mll2tl,HealthyFood,How to eat healthier when all my parents buy is junk.,"If this is the wrong sub for this tell me and I will take it down.

I am 14 years old, and I've been doing at home workouts for about half a year, (light exercises such as jumping jacks or squats, no lifting.) And the hardest challenge in my way right now, as you guessed, eating unhealthy. I weigh average for my age but I am steadily gaining weight. my siblings only eat junk food, pizza, deep fried chicken and fries, brownies, and 2 of the 4 are obese. Almost everyone in my side of the family is overweight and I'm trying my best not to join them. 

Everytime I go downstairs to get a snack all that's on the shelf is either extremely sugary or chips. After not eating any snacks for 2 hours I cave in because my stomach won't stop growling. I try to keep eating unhealthy stuff in low proportions but then I just get too hungry later and eat something. Having an empty stomach it like having an itchy spot on your skin, if I don't scratch it, it will annoy the hell out of me.

Occasionally my parents will buy healthy stuff, but apparently when they buy healthy stuff all of the healthy stuff is gone. Because all of a sudden when I start eating it people get scared it will be gone before they can eat some. The only reason they watt it in the first place is to feel good about themselves for a day or two. And then right bag to eating a full bag of potato chips for them.

I want to be able to keep my appetite under control. Because some of the stuff they get is really hard to resist when I'm hungry. (Pizza, chips, tacos) the only fast food I eat is pizza. I somehow convinced my parents that I don't like fast food. (Which I don't honestly.)

j8nexa,HealthyFood,How many of your calories do you get from junk food?,"I was wondering what you all consider to be healthy eating. For me junk food is anything with lots of sugar and/or salt, low in vitamins and minerals and/or high in saturated fat.

I have some treats everyday that are junk food, and the calories are about 300-400. I eat around 2000 calories a day, depending on how active I was(I eat based on what my body wants and try to get enough protein.

gylwba,HealthyFood,Question about zero cal junk'ish food ?,">!A bit of back story, I've been fat my whole life, for a while i was in denial but I've recently decided that maybe everything sucks because of my shitting eating habits and lack of exercise so I've started eating a bit better. i say a bit better because what I've done so far is starting a food journal and trying to stay under the cal limit that the app is telling me and try to cook more instead of eating empty junk. 
today i stumble on a bottle of soda that had zero cal zero sugar and since those are both the thing i'm tracking to decide if it's ""healthy"" it bugged and tempted me. !<  


TLDR: so my question is, other than the acid that is bad for the teeth what should i be looking for in those 0 everything ""magic"" junk food?  


(also if you have a couple of recipes for someone who never really cooked i'm interested.. my chickpea salad is good but you get bored after 2 weeks lmao)

**Warning Long post ahead**, scroll to the bottom for tldr:

Around January 2019 i was near 100 kgs (220 pounds) of weight. Looking back, i always felt lethargic , sluggish and my weight was also affecting my confidence. Around May 2019, i decided to change things.¬†

I read up a lot about weight loss online and decided to fix my diet first (thanks reddit) and started exercising at home. Initially for the first month or so, I just cut off junk food from my diet. I still ate parathas (pan fried indian bread), and fried things at home, and consumed sugar regularly. I exercised for 20 mins everyday following a youtube video I found online.¬† ( Link at bottom)I worked out early morning ( 7 am initially with the youtube videos)

After about 2 months or so i started to see results. I joined the gym around this time, and started going at 6 am in the morning. I had lost around 6 kgs of weight in this time period and i¬†decided to take my diet and dedication to another level. I focused on cutting off homemade ""bad"" food first. I cut off parathas (pan fried indian bread), fried sabzi (vegatables) and started focusing more on macro nutrients. I still ate rotis (regular indian bread) and cut down rice to once a day. I ate a lot of daal (lentils and legumes) , rotis(regular indian bread) and vegetables during this period. I also started working out and going to the gym during this time period. I worked out for about 1.5 - 2 hours a day following the REDDIT PPL, and made my goal to get abs. I read up a lot online during this period and realized i was still not hitting macro nutrients such as protein and started counting my calorie intake regularly. I did abs twice a day ( once during the workout in the morning , once after coming home from office). To get more protein, i took up my only feasible option, egg whites! I detest the taste of boiled eggs. I remember almost puking when i ate one ( after mixing it in a sandwich and slathering it with sauces). I increased one egg to 2, 2 - 4 and at some point i started eating 8 eggs worth of egg whites (divided into 4 egg whites per meal twice a day)

After about 2 more months¬† (4-5 months into exercising regularly) into the above diet i had lost around¬† 12-15 kgs of weight. I was starting to plateau in my weight loss so i decided to up my game further. I started to eat a lot of daal (boiled lentils and legumes), vegetables and cut off rice completely. I also cut off sugar completely and added a protein shake to complete my macro goals. I added Paneer(cottage cheese) for some fat as it is needed and helped me fulfill my macros. I cut off roti (indian bread) to twice a day ( 2 roti (indian bread) per day). I started swallowing 16 eggs worth of egg whites per day to hit my protein goals \~160 g. I tracked regularly on MFP, a habit which i follow everyday

After about 7-8 months into this diet i cut off rotis completely. My abs were starting to show at this point. To fulfill every macro nutrient, i ate a lot of daal (lentils and legumes), chole (chickpeas), rajma (beans). To fulfill my carb goals, i ate toasted brown bread grilled paneer ( cottage cheese) sandwich, or a cup of rice per day. I drank protein shakes, paneer(cottage cheese) and dal(lentils) to fulfill my protein and fat goals. My exercise and hard work was paying off as i had finally crossed into normal BMI from overweight after a lot of hard work and discipline. I stopped working out abs twice a day as it got too much, but i replaced it with walking for 20 mins during my lunch breaks in office. I gobbled down 16 eggs worth of egg whites everyday.

For abs, I continued the same diet and restricted my total calorie intake further, and added more cardio to my workout routine. I also exercise my abs and core 6 days a week. Right now, my abs are not very well defined but they are starting to show up (15 percent bodyfat) My goal is to reach 12 percent before end of May ( that would mark 1 year) and get well defined abs. I do hanging leg raises ( progessed from supported to 12 X 3) , and weighted situps. I also do a video of athlean x on abs which is killer and is only 7 mins long!

I did slip off / went into maintainence unintentionally in between, and i heard about the advice of adding refeeds to your workout, but i really wanted abs so i pushed myself.

**My learning:**

From being joked about, to random people coming up to me in office, in my localityand my relatives¬† telling me that i inspire them, it has been quite a journey. I never told anyone that I was working out, and the people closest to me didn't even notice when i lost around 10 kgs (20 pounds) of weight initially. Don't do things to impress anyone else. When people started noticing, they started complimenting me and telling me that i inspire them. Some people told me that i can't keep it up for life, i just shrugged those negative feedback off.

You do it with a goal in mind, and you do it for yourself. Nothing will get you farther than discipline. Sometimes you just need to push yourself and make it to the gym. I haven't missed a single day of workout when i was able to. If i couldn't make it to the gym for some reason, i would workout at home following a youtube video. If the gym was closed i would go for running. I did something everyday, and the only break I took was when i was unwell. Motivation is fickle, build discipline¬† it will last you a lifetime. Also after a certain point, not going for a workout feels bad. You have to build up to that habit.

My advice: Start slow, and build a habit. Cut off the junk, you know what it is. Diet is 70% of the game, and exercise only 30. You don't need any special diet, just track what you eat, add portion control, and switch to healthier choices. Slowly get used to your new diet. Fitness is a marathon, not a race. Don't compare your progress to others, but keep a track of your progress. Measure your weight, the scale doesn't lie. Keep working on yourself and keep improving wherever you can, and you will see results soon. Everyone can do it.¬†

Huge shoutout to the reddit [r/fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/) community. It has been my only resource. Youtube channels I watch JTS Juggernaut training system ,, alan thrall ( again heard about these from reddit ) for form.

Jeff Nippard/ Athlean X for general fitness stuff.

**My workout routine Reddit ppl with added exercises:**

**Pull**:Added assisted pullups to normal pullups, recently added 2x forearm exercises supersetted with each other to save time**Push:**Added dips.**Legs**:Added leg extensions ( i dont remember this being in the ppl routine, correct me if im wrong) and farmers walk**Final Leg day:**I start with a core/abs class at my gym (which lasts about an hour)

I added a bit of the glamour muscles to the last leg day with barbell curls, chinups, triceps extension, lat raises . This kills me by the end of my last leg day ( saturday)

On Sundays:I do limber 11 stretches and athlean x 7 mins abs. I run sometimes.

My lifts are pretty weak tbh, but i started from an empty bar or 10kgs and i am around :**60kg (\~120 pounds) bench90kg (\~180 pounds) dl55kg (\~110 pounds )squat45kg (\~90 pounds) ohp**

I do 10 mins of cardio AFTER my workout everyday.I added hanging leg raises, weighted situps to my workout ( initially i did athlean x 7 min abs twice a day at the gym and after work)On my last legs day , ie Saturday, I go for a body wrecking workout. My gym offers a group abs/core class which is brutal and lasts around an hour, after that i workout my legs as mentioned above (Final legs day)

What im doing due to the virus: Bodyweight stuff / pair of dumbles and reps until failure. Diet is a struggle now since im not going to work. Trying to get more equipment to workout at home!

###Stats
M/6'  
Start: May 2018, about 200lbs, 19 years old  
Currently: 187lbs, 21 years old  
[Progress Photos](https://imgur.com/a/KwrICU8)

###Background
In high school I did cross country and track and basically ate whatever I wanted. I was never very lean but always fit. In college I stopped running to focus on academics, but still ate like I ran 40+ miles per week, and went from 175lbs at the start of freshman year to about 200lbs at the end of sophomore year. I would play volleyball a couple times a week but no formal workouts. Around the beginning of 2018 I realized I needed to make a lifestyle change, but it took me until the summer of 2018 to implement it. Each of the dates in the section below is a link to my physique at the time.

###Progress  
####Phase 1: [June](https://i.imgur.com/5RlK3BF.jpg) - [Mid-August 2018](https://i.imgur.com/3A89oro.jpg), 200lbs - 185lbs
Here I was living on my own for an internship and cooked for myself for the first time. I didn't count calories or macros but for the first time really paid attention to what I ate. I tried to eat lots of vegetables and ""clean"" foods. I also paid for a gym membership for the first time, and started with Phrak's GSLP, which I ran for about 10 weeks, with some additional cardio. I was didn't know proper form for any lifts yet, and learned it over this period. I got done to about 185lbs by the end of the summer.  
**Lifts**: S/B/D/P = 225/175/185/85
####Phase 2: [Mid-August](https://i.imgur.com/3A89oro.jpg) - [November 2018](https://i.imgur.com/UnDzrih.jpg), 185lbs - 172lbs
During this time I started strictly counting calories and macros and tracking them with Nsuns spreadsheet. I ran 5 cycles of 5/3/1 for beginners and made lots of progress on form and lifts. At the end of November I weighed 172lbs, the leanest and strongest I'd ever been. This was also a hard cut for me. It took real long term commitment and mental fortitude to avoid junk food, be hungry, and get down to this weight. 
**Lifts**: S/B/D/P = 260/185/270/105
####Phase 3: [December 2018](https://i.imgur.com/UnDzrih.jpg) - [May 2019](https://i.imgur.com/FOYFvv2.jpg), 172lbs - 184lbs
I took the month of December off since I didn't have access to a gym and gained about 3lbs over the holidays. I then came back with a vengeance in January, with a goal to put up some big lifts by the end of the school year in May. I made sure I got enough protein intake during this time, but didn't track calories (I haven't tracked them since). I moved here to Nsuns 531 lp 5-day program, which I ran from the beginning of January through mid-march. I made a ton of progress in the big lifts during this time. However, I injured my left hip-flexor which prevented me from squatting as heavy as I would have liked. I recovered from the injury in the beginning of April and went into a peaking phase, with the goal of hitting some max lifts in May. I actually don't remember what program I ran for that month and a half.  
**Training maxes in March**: S/B/D/P = 275/205/325/125  
**1RM in May**: S/B/D/P = 315/215/385/135  
####Phase 4: [June 2019](https://i.imgur.com/48ZeqHS.jpg) - [Present](https://i.imgur.com/9MYwqMV.jpg), 184lbs - 187lbs
Over the summer I worked a lot and also started doing jiu jitsu at a local gym, as well as biking and generally being outside, so I only lifted two or three times per week on the GZLP program. My main goal over the summer was to maintain my lifts. I then had a crazy first half of this semester on a job search for post graduation since I'm a senior this year during which time I continued doing GZLP three times a week. I'm also in a fitness swimming class this semester, so I'm currently swimming for 45 minutes twice a week, which has made a huge impact on my cardio. I essentially didn't increase any of my 1RM's during this time, but maintained them pretty well.
####Moving forward
I've accepted a job offer, and with the interview process done am less busy now, so will have more time for lifting. I'm going to start enough cycle of NSun's 4day with a goal of reaching 4/3/2/1 plates in the near future. I'm not sure if I want to bulk in the coming months, or try to just maintain. Any thoughts?

###What I've learned
* Food is super important, you can't out-train a crap diet.  
* Discipline and habit are so much more important than motivation. You will never stay 100% motivated long term, but you can easily maintain a habit.
* Don't let a injury get you down. I've probably had 5 or 6 minor injuries during this time that made me stop doing a lift for a month or two. Gains will come back quickly as long as you let yourself fully heal.
* Sleep is so important. I've always been a good sleeper, and have noticed this semester in particular that I feel great when I get around 9 hours of sleep every night, which I have been successfully doing (though my social life has slightly suffered due to this). 
* I also want to say thanks to this sub for the inspiration, insight, and general knowledge that I've gained on this journey!",2019-11-03 19:54:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/dr5pw1/21m6_15_year_transformation/

dmmk4m,Fitness,My 5 Year Transformation,"I have been lurking on this community for the last 5 years so I thought I would give back and share my progess/what has worked for me <3

**Tl;dr**

&#x200B;

* 5 Years
* 175lb to 155lb

**Before/After Pictures:**

[https://imgur.com/DiM483L](https://imgur.com/DiM483L)

&#x200B;

**Stats:**

*Sex*: Male

*Age*: 25

*Height*: 5'9""

&#x200B;

**Background:**

I have been working out on and off for the last 5 years. I would go hard on my deployments then stop working out for up to a year before redeploying and getting back in the habit. 

I have been hitting the gym almost every day for the last 6 months. This past winter I put on about 25lbs of fat.

&#x200B;

**Routine:**

I've always just winged it, following this basic plan.

&#x200B;

* Chest / Triceps / Abs
* Back / Biceps / Abs
* Shoulders / Legs / Traps

My favorite chest exercises: DB Flat Bench Press, DB Incline Bench Press, Dips, various forms of Cable Fly, DB Pullover, and DB closegrip press

My favorite tricep exercises: Overhead tricep extensions, Close Grip Bench Press, Dips, Skullscrushers, Tricep Pushdown with a rope.

My favorite back exercises: BB Row, Seated Cable Row, Seated Cable Pull Down, and pullups.

Shoulders: Seated BB OHP, Seated DB shoulder press, Seated DB rotational shoulder press, Lateral Raise, Bent over rear deltoid raise.

Legs: Honestly I slack in this department. I've been working on this the most the last month. I have just been using the machines my gym offers.

Abs: Various machines in the gym and leg raises.

**The biggest thing I can recommend here is to perfect your form**. I start with a low weight to make sure my muscles are warmed up and my form is perfect before increasing.

Example for when I DB Shoulder Press:

&#x200B;

* 10 reps with 40lb DB
* 10 reps with 50lb DB
* 9 Reps with 60lb DB
* 8 Reps with 65lb DB
* 7 Reps with 70lb DB
* 5 Reps with 75lb Db

I make sure my form is perfect and I go reaaaaaal slow on the **eccentric contraction.**

Look into mind-muscle connection and time under tension. Also, make sure you are breathing right.

**Diet:**

Again I have just been winging this part. I try my hardest to avoid sugars and processed carbs. I don't track calories or macros but will probably have to here soon.

Sample day:

Breakfast (If I even eat breakfast... somedays I'm in the gym at 730AM and don't eat until I get home at 1 pm): Bacon chopped up with wilted spinach, greek yogurt, banana, and/or a protein shake. Depending on how I'm feeling.

Lunch: Grilled chicken. Sometimes I eat it on a toasted Hawaiian roll, sometimes I will eat it with a little bit of rice. The key for me was to just limit the carbs. Not to have it on bread+a fat serving of rice.

Snack: Frozen Brussel sprouts, berries, banana, spinach, greek yogurt blended together. I never used to like vegetables but I can't even taste them. I can't recommend this enough.

Snack: Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, more fruit, maybe a protein shake.

Dinner: Whatever my family is cooking. Usually, fish/beef/sometimes pizza.

I think the key is just not to eat junk food(e.g. Oreos, cookies, soda, candy etc.) and limit the number of processed carbs you are putting into your body. Sugar is addicting as \*\*\*\* and doesn't fill you up. I could eat half a thing of Oreos in one sitting. Chobani Flips are greek yogurt with other things to mix in. I love the Cookies & Cream or S'mores but they have a zillion flavors. This lets me get my sweet tooth itch + fills me up.

**Sleep:**

I used to stay up late at night on my devices, catching whatever sleep I could. I wouldn't be able to get out of bed in the morning. Now when I wake up I can't go back to sleep because I am too excited to go to the gym.

Now I cut my screen time off an hour before bedtime, take a shower, meditate, and fall right asleep.

I had a problem where I would wake up in the middle of the night to go pee, but I stopped drinking liquids 2 hours before bedtime.

Deep sleep is really important. Read more about it here: [https://www.healthline.com/health/deep-sleep](https://www.healthline.com/health/deep-sleep)

**My Thoughts / Takeaways:**

I have never felt this good in my life. I am so confident at the gym and it is bleeding over into other areas of my life. My social anxiety is gone. I have a desire to get out of bed in the morning.

Don't overcomplicate this. Consistency is key.

Don't be afraid to dance in the gym. It releases endorphins and the rhythm gives your brain something to focus on between sets. [https://www.goodnet.org/articles/dance-like-nobodys-watching-science-says-its-good-for-you](https://www.goodnet.org/articles/dance-like-nobodys-watching-science-says-its-good-for-you)

Do ask people at the gym for help or advice. Most of the time they are more than willing to pass on their knowledge and experience.

&#x200B;

I am extremely grateful for this community. I have learned so much lurking over the years.

Much love,

cwg1el,Fitness,"25/M/5'8"" 150lb to 172lb - My 4 year ""Powerbuilding"" Journey","Hi guys,

Previous post was deleted. Hopefully I get it right this time.

Been a long time lurker on here and I thought its finally time to give back to the community that helped me so much when I first started lifting. Thank you all for doing what you do and keep inspiring/helping everyone to pursue their fitness goals!

**PHOTOS:**

[Before and after photo](https://imgur.com/YpGqD3j)

**WEIGHT:**

149lb (68KG) to 172lb (78KG) in the photos

The 172lb weight represents my weight at the time of the after photo which was at the end of a 'cut'. Weight climbed as high as 189lb during the 'bulk'.

**TIME PERIOD**

Approximately 4 years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when I was travelling/busy with university.

**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

Please note that most of these numbers were achieved at a higher bodyweight of around 183lb (83kg) to 189lb (86kg) and does not reflect my strength when cut down.

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 135lb (60kg) to 573lb (260kg)

**Deadlift (Sumo):** 135lb (60kg) to 617lb (280kg)

**Bench:** 88lb (40kg) to 342lb (155kg)

**OHP:**  45lb (20kg) to 232lb (105kg)

**Squat:** 135lb (60kg) to 463lb (210kg)

\&#x200B;

**PROGRAM**

My goal was always to be both strong and big so I never really focused entirely on bodybuilding or powerlifting and always combined both training styles into my programming.

When I first started I ran a full body workout (i think it was ICF lol) 3 times a week but quickly grew out of it in a few months (wanted to be at the gym more). I then got some help and guidance from a friend who had been lifting for quite some time and he was running a variation of OGUS 753. I followed his template and then slowly started my accessories to it and it slowly adapted into a PPLPPL  split. The split would generally be something along these lines

**Monday - OHP  (following Ogus 753 rep schemes) and shoulder accessories**

Example workout would be

* 5x7 OHP at 75% One rep max
* 5x8 Arnold press
* 5x20 lateral raises
* 5x20 rear delt flies
* 5x12 face pulls
* 5x12 cable lateral raise
* Tricep accessories vary

**Tuesday - Hypertrophy Back day**

Example workout would be

* 10x10 body weight pull ups focusing on lats
* 5x12 bent over rows
* 4x12 cable pullovers
* 5x12 seated row
* 5x12 lat pulldown
* 5x12 single arm rows
* Bicep accessories vary

**Wednesday - Squats (Following Ogus 753 rep schemes) and leg accessories**

Example workout would be

* 10x3 Squats at  85% One rep Max
* 5x20 Walking Lunges
* 5x12 Leg Hamstring Curl
* 5x12 Leg Extension
* 5x12 Leg Press
* 4x12 Straight Leg Deadlifts

**Thursday - Bench (Following Ogus 753 rep scheme) and chest accessories**

Example workout would be

* 7x5 Bench at  80% One rep Max
* 5x12 Incline Dumbell Press
* 5x12 Hammer strength machine
* 5x12 Chest Fly top down
* 5x12 Chest fly bottom up
* 4x25 Push ups
* 5x12 Landmine presses

**Friday - Deadlifts (Following Ogus 753 rep schemes) and back accessories**

Example workout would be

* 6x6 Deadlift at 70% One rep Max (Deload)
* 5x10 Pull ups (weighted)
* 5x8 Rowing movement
* 5x8 Lat pulldown
* Bicep accesories if there is time

Saturday - Rest or if I ended up gyming would be a hyper chest day

**Sunday - Hypertrophy leg day**

Example workout would be

* 5x10 front squads
* 5x10 close stance squat
* 5x12 good girl bad girl machine (each side)
* 5x5 hip thrusts

I would also do core every second day which is usually just 5x12 hanging leg raises and 5x12 decline sit ups with weight behind head.

Obviously working out 7 days is not ideal for everyone and I would highly recommend at least taking a day off but It seemed to work for me and my body was handing it pretty well so i continued to do so (i don't anymore fyi haha)

I basically followed this split for about 2.5 years and had probably gone from 154lb to about 178lb at this point and then started to stall on my lifts (especially on 10 sets of 3 at 85% for most of my lifts -  those workouts are brutal and it takes over an hour to even get through just your compounds LOL)

Anyway at this point I think my lifts were

S - 419lb (190kg)                    B- 264lb (120kg)                  D(sumo) - 551lb (250kg)

However with progress slowing down, I looked online for a different program that aligned with my goals. Thats when I found Layne Nortons PH3. A few of my friends at the gym had run this program already at this point so I asked around and the general consensus was that it was hard but a good program. So i decided to run it.

[Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Yq5-rlDPc_FrkNGjzTbOPN-ym5ixH9AGV7agowx-JvU) \- to the spreadsheet i used to track this FYI

After completing PH3 my numbers were around

S - 463lb (210kg)           B- 315lb (142.5kg)                    D(Sumo) - 617 (280kg)

Which I was pretty happy with for 3 months of training. However the program is definitely hard and I would highly recommend not taking the AMRAP sets to failure as the fatigue definitely builds up (i ended up with a very sore hip and elbow after many sessions). Still would highly recommend PH3 to most people though.

Now it brings us to current time. I'm sitting at around 191lb (86.5kg) and I've been running Smolov Junior bench because I can't squat (torn quad from going too ham after coming back from a holiday lol) and been deadlifting once a week. I've gone back to a PPLPPL split but been adding bench on top of normal workouts (not doing many push accessories though)

Recently maxed out bench and hit 342lb (155kg) but really gunning for that 160kg bench (353lb)

\&#x200B;

**DIET**

Diet hasn't changed significantly over the last few years with bulking diet and cutting diet remaining pretty similar apart from portion size.

Below is a typical day of eating for me when cutting down

**Breakfast**

Toast, Peanut Butter, Cereal, Milk/Almond Milk, Eggs with Egg whites if I can be bothered and Fruit

**Lunch**

300g cooked protein source (Chicken breast, Chicken Tenderloins, Beef, Salmon, Beef mince)

300g Cooked carb source (Wholemeal pasta, Sweet potato, Brown rice, Basmati Rice)

200g Vegetable (Brocolli, Beans, Asparagus, Frozen Vege mixtures etc)

These meals are usually split into 150g protein, 150g carb and 100g vege containers (I meal prep around 18 of these a week). If i can I space these meals out 2 hours so i technically have 2 lunches.

**Dinner - Post Gym**

150g protein source

150g carb source

100g vege

Protein Shake (Double scoop if requried)

**Snack**

Some form of protein bar or snack that im craving (rice crackers usually)

Usually this adds up to about 2600-2700 calories when im cutting.

When im bulking, the meals are almost the same but I may have bigger breakfasts, more snacks and my meals increase from 150g protein carb to 200g protein and carb. I generally eat around 3500-3600 calories when im bulking. My macro targets are usually around 200g protein, 60-80g fat and the rest carbs no matter if im bulking or cutting.

When I bulk, im probably at a 80% clean food 20% ""cheat"" food ratio although i would say my cheat food is not considered cheat food all the time. I make conscious decisions on eating protein rich junk foods like I would consider subway footlong a 'cheat' food for me when I am dieting.

**STORY**

I won't go too indepth but basically I have always been into sport (mainly playing soccer/football) but once I got into university, I stopped exercising and started living alone which made me extremely lazy. I would always go the whole day eating one normal meal and would spend a lot of my time playing video games. I started getting really bad acne on my face which made me super self conscious and slowly made me more and more anti social (gyming actually didnt help this and i had to eventually seek professional help for this). Thats when I decided that something needed to change so  I started working out at home. Around this time was when i started browsing /r/fitness and realized that I should probably be working out in a gym so i resigned up to my university gym and the rest is history!

I am extremely glad that i made that decision that day to resign up for the gym as now a lot of my closest friends are at/from the gym and I genuinely look forward to going in everyday. So thank you /r/fitness for changing my life :)

If you want to see the full transformation, message me on here and I can link you the video as transformation videos aren‚Äôt allowed here.

Thank you all for reading and keep training hard!

We're all gonna make it brahs.

Please give me some time and i'm sorry if I miss you!

ctzn1l,Fitness,2 YEAR PROGRESS (21/M/181lbs),"So yesterday marked my 22nd birthday. The first birthday I've ever had that I feel was completely meaningless, which I guess means I'm officially an adult.

However, because it was my birthday yesterday, it means that today is the 2 year anniversary of when I finally started caring about my health. It's also the day the first picture was taken. That's how I looked at my worst, 261lbs. I had been overweight most of my life, and obese since I was about 14, but my entire life I never saw myself as a fat person and kept pretending to myself that I was something different. August 22nd 2017 is the day I decided to make that dream into my reality.

This is the story of how I overcame my depression, recovered from alcoholism, lost 106lbs, and found a purpose in my life.

[Pictures here, dates at bottom and explained throughout the post.](https://imgur.com/a/KRvXzld?fbclid=IwAR01xXuYNv3SjADCs7d2mnHE0VYWiE5O3UZ6tRG0B3N6JWpVw33hdv6Zeig)

&#x200B;

**Background**

I had messed around with diets on 2 previous occasions in my life. The first time was when I was in high school, I knew next to nothing about health or fitness and just took the basic steps that everyone knows they should do in order to lose weight. The common sense diet. I went from drinking around 2 litres of soda every day, and eating what now seems like it would have been at least 1500 calories of candy and chocolate every day on top of my regular meals, to not drinking any soda and limiting my ""junk"" food intake. I also made a more conscious decision to try and eat fruits and vegetables as well as lean meats. I lost a little weight but at the time I was too ashamed of myself to weigh in before or after. This attempt to lose weight lasted maybe a month, but some of the habits stuck. I learned how to cook, remained conscious of my junk food intake, and started eating vegetables.

The second time, when i was 18 I had heard online about the idea of counting calories, but never knew apps existed to do this for you. I looked at the packaging of the food I was eating, wrote the calories into the notes on my phone and tried to exercise. I lifted weights with no structure, and used my elliptical machine for an hour maybe once a week. I lost 36lbs this way, then went on vacation and returned to my old habits while on that vacation. Once I returned home I was too ashamed of myself to weigh myself anymore. This attempt ended once the vacation did.

The third time was a success. My dad and my sister had both been dieting for a few months before my birthday, losing around 30lbs each. I noticed they were both using myfitnesspal and heard my sister talk about how easy it was because it tracked the calories for you. In work later that day I decided to download it and check it out. I never liked the layout so I deleted it and downloaded a similar app called ""loseit."" Still to this day 2 years later I use that app to track my food, once you've logged a few thousand foods it's hard to go back. Before this diet I was in the worst place I've ever been mentally, I had my heart broken by my girlfriend of 2 and a half years. She had mentally abused me, i felt like I was dependant on her but looking back I now realise she was a horrible influence on my life. Once she broke up with me I became an alcoholic. I used to struggle with depression (used to, more on this later) and after breaking up with her I started to drink, every single day. I was going into work drunk, eating their junk food twice a shift, leaving and drinking. I wanted to die but I saw myself as being too pussy to kill myself, I couldn't do that to my family. Drinking made me care less about how others would feel if I did, and i saw it as an easy way to actually kill myself. I drank every day for around 3 months, spending the entirety of my days looking forward to going home and killing a couple shots. I wasn't a functioning human being for those months. Eventually I met another girl and she pulled me out of this hole without even realising it. It felt like she was the first person I had met for years who actually cared about me. That girl was the best thing that ever happened to me, i couldn't act the way I had been around her, and I wanted to impress her by changing my life completely. She was the motivation for me to stop drinking, the motivation for me to start. Discipline is what kept me doing it after.

**The weight loss**

When I started this journey I knew it was different this time. I was determined I was going to do it properly. I spent my free time reading everything online about nutrition, trying to figure out what was waffle and what was real information, it was surprisingly difficult. When I was younger and had attempted to lose weight I tried to half ass the research and believed everything I read from a ""post workout feeding window"" to ""your body can only digest 20g of protein at a time"" and was too lazy to check if this information was actually real, but this time if I thought something was real I normally did follow up research. I started by just eating what I was already, just making sure I got the calories within my calorie goal, a 1000 calorie deficit. Slowly over time I made changes to my diet, eating more vegetables, caring about my protein intake, and gradually decreasing all the things that didn't benefit me. Food became fuel.

I work in fast food, so to start with I was still eating burgers most days, this changed over time. Even though it was incredibly tempting to be around the fast food every day, one benefit it does bring is that it made sure I wasn't completely sedentary. Walking 40 hours a week isn't enough to be considered exercise, but for a 261lb man i couldn't survive a shift without breaking a sweat, and it definitely burnt a few hundred calories. On top of this, I slowly started to learn more about exercise. I went back to lifting weights with no real structure, and started to play golf every week with my dad. Golf as a fat person burns a surprising amount of calories, I averaged 9 holes of my course out to be around 500.

I made a few mistake with this journey, I kept the deficit too high even when my weight was starting to get really low, I believed that there was no point in me lifting weights while losing weight because I wouldn't have been able to get stronger while in a deficit, and eventually stopped trying. The first mistake was just a fat man desperate to see his abs for the first time ever, the second was a mixture of my fat self being too lazy to work out, and my new self believing waffle without clarifying.

I finished losing the weight on July 28th 2018, I maintained my weight for a few weeks then went on vacation to america for my 21st birthday. The second picture is taken on August 21st 2018, the day of my 21st birthday. 155lbs

Once I got home I weighed myself every day for a week, noticed I hadn't gained even a quarter of a pound while on vacation, reassured myself I knew what I was doing and then decided to bulk up.

**The Bulk (So Far)**

As the weight loss neared a close I did a lot of research into bulking, I discovered r/fitness and decided that a lean bulk was the best approach for me, because the idea of putting fat on too quickly again was not appealing.

The first programme I ran was this:  [https://darebee.com/programs/ironborn-program.html](https://darebee.com/programs/ironborn-program.html)

It's basically a beginners dumbbell only PPL. I ran it twice, and then afterwards started to learn more about optimal training, and adding more exercises and more sets to it.

I started out using only a pair of adjustable dumbbells, then a barbell, and now I own basically an entire home gym. (Located in my bedroom. Big bedroom.) I started to learn more about how to target each muscle, rep ranges, volume of training, the basics of programming and slowly wrote my own PPL based on the equipment I had. My training was far from optimal, for a while the most weight i could put on the dumbbells was 15kg each so my rep ranges for a while were in the high 30s for some exercises. Eventually i bought more weight, and I'll continue to buy more as I get stronger.

I also started to use my elliptical machine, and eventually got into running. After a while I was running 10 miles a day, as well as a half marathon at the weekend. I tore my calf because my mind was a hell of a lot stronger than my body, and had to stop. I tore it a further two times by trying to rush back to where I was too quickly, but eventually after the third tear I went to a physio, shes been rehabbing it and I've been slowly getting back into running for the last 3 weeks. This struggle with my calf has made me realise that sometimes I need to just relax, trust the process, and stop being so hard on myself all the time.

So far I've put on around 26lbs, a little bit of this has been unnecessary fat gain because occasionally my former fat self would reappear for a day and I'd put down 8000 calories, yet my abs have always stuck around. I think the pressure of trying to be so hard on myself led to an unhealthy relationship with food. I've put a stop to this since, and my diet is the best its ever been with complete freedom to eat ""junk"" if ever I want, but i never really want to because i feel ""clean"" food makes me feel and function better. The third picture was taken today. 181lbs

My current programme looks like this, I'm currently nursing a slight shoulder injury so my Push day isn't totally accurate to what im doing right now, but this is what I will be doing once its fully healed:

I've discovered that my biceps respond to a lot of volume, as well as my chest, so there's a lot of sets for those muscles. I also don't have any reps written down for my calf because I'm just increasing it as instructed by my PT. As a few months pass I'll add more volume. I'm also running Monday Thursday and Saturday right now, and intend to play golf on Saturdays again once my body is fully healed.

**Life For Me Now**

Well first off, as I mentioned earlier I no longer have any real problems with my depression. As you can imagine repeating the same injury 3 times in a row was pretty soul destroying, especially because it's not just a minor tear, I had to take weeks off of everything that involved being on my feet for any prolonged period of time, I had to take months off of work, but I never let myself get too down mentally. I've been upset, I've felt depressed, but the difference is that now I can wake up the next day and feel better. Now I can tell that every day that passes everything will be a little bit better, and it's so refreshing almost always waking up happy. Having people in my life care about me helps massively, but I've come to realise I shouldn't only live for peoples opinions of me. I don't think depression every truly leaves you, it just sits dormant, but constantly having goals helps with keeping it dormant. Eating well,  exercising and having confidence in myself also help massively.

I dont really drink anymore, but I'm not completely sober. I was on vacation last month and I had a few drinks, (the 4th picture is me on vacation. Tanning oil, good lighting and a slight tan means that's the best picture I have of myself to date) I'm being taken out for dinner this weekend and ill probably have one or two drinks, but it's a choice to have it. I do not feel dependant on it, and I treat it as a thing for special occasions because most of the time it doesn't appeal to me. i would say i'm fully recovered from my struggles with alcohol now.

i'm still not totally used to looking how i do now. 10 years of being the fat kid really leaves it mentally stamped into your head that is how you look. I still check myself out in the mirror a lot because i'm not used to seeing what I see. i'm working on accepting myself for who i am now, and I'm trying to continue to learn and improve my physical and mental health. I also try and help people who ask me with their health and fitness related goals because I've definitely learned a lot over the last 2 years.

My diet nowadays is basically the same types of food every day, but with a lot of variety. I eat around 4/5 meals every day, made up with some sort of carb source such as rice or potatoes, a protein source in the form of meat or fish, and a tonne of vegetables. Breakfasts are normally some sort of oats with fruit mixed in and a protein shake, or wholegrain cereal with a protein shake, or peanut butter on toast and a shake. The option to eat junk food is always there now, but most of the time I never want to... aside from the huge slice of cake I had yesterday.

I no longer break a sweat at work, I no longer get out of breath from a slight jog, I no longer eat because I'm bored and I do not treat food as a drug. I'm starting to finally fill out shirt sleeves, and I can finally look at myself in a mirror and feel happy about how I look now, and know that I'm only going to keep improving myself both physically and mentally. I get compliments from girls about my appearance for the first time in my life. I'm ambitious, I'm driven. But most importantly I enjoy life.

**Goals for the future**

First off I want to get back to running and lifting properly. My body hasn't worked at 100% since February but this is the closest I've been to full fitness since then thanks to my wonderful PT.

I'm going to commit fully to this bulk until the end of the year. I dont want to think about cutting until I'm close to 195/200lbs.

I've always wanted to be in the military, that's why I balance lifting with running, but a few months ago I decided my goal is to sign up for the British parachute regiment. I find that I function best when I push myself to be the best i can, and just settling for regular army doesn't feel like it challenges me enough. (no offence anyone at all) Because of this, once my calf is fully back to normal and I can run properly again I need to get down to around a 6 minute mile.

I would also one day like to be around 200lbs at hopefully around 11% bodyfat, I'm still not totally used to having abs so I like to think I'll have them forever.

My lifting has no real numbers attached to the goals, I want to be big and strong, doesn't everyone? I'll keep lifting until I no longer can, PR's will be set and broken during this, none set as of yet.

And lastly, I like to think I'll be able to run marathons with relative ease when I'm a few years older.

I have fairly lofty goals, but that's how I like to think about my life nowadays. I like to feel like I'm chasing something. Constantly trying to better myself physically and mentally.  ""Make your goals unreasonable. Chase your unreasonable goals with an unreasonable amount of effort, tenacity, intensity and ferocity. Maintain an unreasonable amount of anger over failing to meet your unreasonable goals. Do all this, and you will create a margin between you and those who were pursuing reasonable goals that is completely unreasonable."" - Mythical Strength

**Background**

I messed around with a few sports growing up but never fully committed because I was too busy playing video games and despising athleticism. The last thing I did was fencing, which I only did once a week for about an hour and gave up when I was 15 for a total of maybe two years. In the summer of 2017 I ran /r/bodyweightfitness beginner routine but couldn't do more than two pullups per set, sometimes 1. I ran the program for 2 months with no visible difference and so strength difference except for maybe 1 or 2 more pushups per set than I started with. Could never do more than 6. In the summer of 2018 I worked landscaping for 4 months and I got a *bit* bigger, but capped out at 166lbs which was a decent amount of body fat because I ate like such shit. At the end of the summer I was able to do maybe 3 pullups per set and decided to do the BWF routine  again for a month before quitting. All the muscle quickly atrophied from being so sedentary September-December 2018. Around the new year, I thought I had a regular slim build but saw myself in a video of the beach that my mom took of me in which I saw a wide stomach with a muffin top and lanky arms, and decided I was going to start using that college gym membership and do it with free weights this time. I started off as your typical skinnyfat with absolutely no muscle mass.

**Routine**

I started off with SL 5x5 as it just seemed really simple, which would have been the easiest thing to just get me in the gym. It was all going solidly except I couldn't start out with overhead pressing the bar, I had to start with 6kg dumbbells and work my way up. About a month and a half in, I switched to Phrak's GSLP off suggestions from this subreddit and continued to run it for its suggested time of 3 months (including the time spent on 5x5 because they're so similar). I then switched to 5/3/1 for Beginners in about mid-April and have been doing it since then, on my fifth cycle now. Additionally, since May of 2019 I've been doing landscaping again, contributing maybe a little bit of muscle gain.

Mondays: Squats/Bench as per the program, bodyweight assistance done as supersets with the main lifts, so 8 sets total of each. I do Squats with pushups and hanging knee raises, 8 and 7 reps respectively, for a total of 64 and 56 reps respectively. I do chinups with bench presses, 5-6 reps per set, for a total of 40-45.

Wednesdays: Deadlift/Overhead as per the program. Dips with deadlifts, 6 per set for 48 total. Overhead press with bodyweight rows and single leg squats (no dumbbells because I want to focus my balance first) for 8 reps per, total of 64 each.

Friday: Same as monday, sub pullups in for chinups.

**Diet**

I ate like absolute shit before starting and still did when I started. I never learned to cook because the honest truth is I'm too lazy and never had to learn, always lived with my parents and my dad would always cook or come up with something for dinner. I usually skipped breakfast for time reasons and ate lunch something fast foody on campus, almost every day. When I started lifting I made my post-workout 3 McDoubles (no condiments or cheese, just plain bun and two patties) from a McDonalds right next to my gym because it was convenient for someone too lazy to cook and with difficulty eating higher amounts of calories in a day. I could just go there, throw in ~$5, and come out with nearly 1000 calories of burgers. Terrible idea, I know, I stopped doing it in April but I honestly believe it may have helped. Otherwise I'd still eat whatever fast food on campus for lunch and whatever my dad came up with for dinner. I never cooked or made sandwiches for myself or anything. Typical meals were frozen pizzas, subway, mcdonald's, popeyes, you name it. In April I cut out a lot of junk food just because I found my appetite for chips and chocolate and sugary shit just completely dropped, nowadays I rarely eat any of that. Still, I don't count calories and I *try* to include protein where I can, but don't really make an effort.

**Lifts**

Squat: 5x45lbs > 2x200lbs

Bench: 5x45 lbs > 5x130lbs

Deadlift: 5x95lbs > 1x250lbs

Overhead Press: 5x25 lbs > 3x90lbs

Numbers derived from my max testing 2-3 weeks ago before starting my 5th cycle.

**Future**

In the next two months, I'm moving into an apartment building with a mezzanine floor that has a very well equipped gym. I'm hoping to maybe switch up my routine to something 4 or 5 days a week because completely eliminating travel time and shortening time spent per day would be much much easier. I'll also have to start eating properly, will be living with a roommate but my food options are entirely up to me and it seems like a good way to throw myself in the deep end of making my own proper food choices. I also want to stop doing deadlifts because I honestly just don't care for them and the injury risk, I'm already stalling on them. I'd probably replace them with RDLs. Other than that, excited for what the future brings and I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions on what I can do/change in the future :)",2019-08-03 17:09:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cll4t2/65_month_transformation_no_specific_diet_or/

I have always eaten a lot, but I guess I have a fast metabolism. I feel great and am proud of myself for sticking with it this long. I've still got a lot of work to do.

&#x200B;

**Diet:**

I eat a lot. I eat a big lunch and then I'm hungry an hour later. As I started my workout, I made sure to focus on my protein intake. A lot of junk food was replaced with healthier food, with of course more protein. Chips and cookies became peanuts and protein bars. At my college I had an unlimited meal plan, so I tried to go as much as possibly, even more than breakfast/lunch/dinner. I drank a lot of milk and water vs. soda which I could've had easily because I'm in college and could drink whatever I want. I'd say my calorie intake was over 3500, however I did not keep track of it too closely which I guess I should've done better.

&#x200B;

Breakfast: Usually a couple bowls of cereal.

Lunch: Depended on what they had in the cafeteria lol. I would try to get things like chicken breast, burgers, salad. (Put chicken breast in the salad.  But when I got a suite further away and not a unlimited plan, I made things like sandwiches with coldcuts (turkey, cheese, ham etc..), scrambled eggs.

Dinner: Also depended on the cafeteria.  But when I got a suite further away and not a unlimited plan, I made things like chicken, pasta, sausage, burgers, salads,

c9iq9t,Fitness,I'm testing for my 2nd degree blackbelt and my physical health is very poor. Any tips?,"Hey everyone. I'm testing for my 2nd Dan in Karate in 2 months. I've tried to make changes to my nutrition and lifestyle to become healthier but my plans haven't come to fruition. I'm starting to worry. I'm 30 years old, 180-185 lbs (I want to be around 165-170) and I feel the worst I've ever felt. I know cardio is going to be paramount for my test and nutrition is a important factor overall.

Right now my plan is to increase intake of lean meats, healthy fats, vegetables two-fold, water, and remove sugars entirely, like junk food, added sugars, and simple carbs. This hasn't worked. I've been eating junk food constantly and the fact there are 3 burger joints down the street from me doesn't help. It's not for lack of knowledge but rather psychological issues I've been battling my whole life. I'm going to see if I can see someone about it.

As for exercise, I know I should be running and sprinting, as well as compound exercises to activate more muscles and burn more calories. I want to run every morning around 5:30am Mon - Fri, so I can go to work at 7, go to the gym Tues, Thurs, and Fri., Karate Mon, Wed, Sat, and Sun is rest day... but it never happens. Rarely do I go to the gym even though it's literally down the street or do I wake up at 5am. I prefer fasted running in the morning to feel fresh for the rest of the day, whereas at night I'd more than likely not after work.

This is entirely my problem. My failures are my own, I know that, but any tips would be helpful. Has anyone else had poor motivation or severe depression and if so, how did you overcome it to become healthier? Mental tricks to convince yourself to go to the gym? How did you quit cravings for junk food?

Slightly NSFW fat guy in boxers. 

https://imgur.com/a/ZEiP2db

&nbsp;

In early 2017 I actually was up to 420lbs (sadly I have no pictures from those days, I wasn't ahh very photogenic) and slowly without any real plan I started toward my goals with small steps like cutting out soda and cutting back on junk food and spending a little time getting introduced to the gym.  January 2018 I knuckled down and put a more disciplined routine in to effect.  January to December of 2018 I lost 107 pounds 377 to 270.  Off to a rocky start this year mostly on the diet side, but I've been kind of compensating by still killing it in the gym,  currently I'm at 245 lbs.  Lately as I've been getting lighter I've introduced some of the big compound lifts likes squats and deadlifts and it's been doing wonders I didn't know where possible on my posterior chain and general muscle balance.  Lately between compounding weight loss and muscle gain the difference I've been feeling in my overall physical capabilities has been staggering and of course, immensely motivating. 

Heres a breakdown of my routine. 

&nbsp;

-**Intermittent fasting** 16 hours fasted & 8 hour meal periods.  This has been a huge help in caloric intake management but I've also definitely noticed many other health benefits while I was maintaining I. F.  I had a very good experience using I. F. for a while and would suggest it to anyone looking to lose a lot of weight but I've had a harder time maintaining it in the new year as I've grown fond of morning coffee to help me get started...

&nbsp;

-**Weekly meal prep** with high protein, low carbs veggies and fruits.
https://imgur.com/gallery/5ZldALS
Heres a folder that showcases a lot of the meals I've made.  I worked toward a balance of nutrition but also being able to enjoy the meals so I certainly didn't maintain perfect discipline.  Always included fruit but it didn't always make it in the pictures.  This is the single biggest game changer in my routine, without my meal prep I absolutely never could have made this much progress on my weight. 

&nbsp;

-**Meal replacement shakes** for dinner. 3-5 times a week.  I've been through many brands, currently using Labrada High Protein meal replacement shakes, not the best flavor or nutrition, but balanced with price point I've found it pass-able.  Been trying to rely on these less as proper whole foods are priority but I've still found it to be a reliable crutch.

&nbsp;

-I use C4 Preworkout and Gold standard 100% whey Isolate for post workout shakes, sometimes with some fruits and stuff blended. 

&nbsp;

-5x days at the gym weekly. Usually the weekly routine is. 

Sunday: Cardio

Monday: Lower Body 

Tuesday:  Upper Body

Wednesday: Rest

Thursday: Lower Body

Friday: Upper Body

Saturday: Rest

&nbsp;

I'm not the type to catalogue workout routines or keep tabs on numbers. This means I can't accurately quantify my overall gains when it comes to muscle progress or cardiovascular health. That being said I will just kind of go through where I'm at right now with my workout routine and numbers to give you an idea.    
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Cardio Day:**
A lot of times I just go in stretch and hit the elliptical hard for an hour (heres my personal record on the elliptical atm https://imgur.com/a/x2S5QZz 
Lately I've been mixing it up using different machines mostly arc and treadmill and starting with some step burpies and high steps etc.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Lower Body Day:**
15 Minutes HIIT on ARC to warm up. 

**Squats** (Recently added this month, Smith machine, no squat rack, assuming Smith bar is 20lbs.) 
5x5 Working sets are 240 lbs, first set is 120 for warmup. 

**Leg Press** 5x10 (Dunno sled weight something like 80-100 lbs? Just including 45lbs plate count here) 
5x10 10x Plate Warmup 16x plate working sets, drop weight on last set if necessary. 
I do 5x step burpees in between each set here to try and keep heart rate up.

4x10 Superset

**Calf Extension Machine** 350lbs after warm-up set

**Leg Curl Machine** 100lbs

**Deadlifts** (Another new lift, chose leg day as upper body time table is pushing it.)
5x5 110lbs Warmup,  160lbs working sets, usually fail fifth set.  Got a lot of work to do here.. 

Thats about it, after the dead lifts I do a little core work like planks or leg lifts 3x10 and then spend some time on a full body stretching routine on the true stretch.  On my weekends(monday tuesday) if I'm feeling it I'll spend 30 minutes minutes on the elliptical after the workout as well.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Upper Body Day:**

15 Minutes HIIT on ARC to warm up. 

3x10 Superset

**Flat DB Bench Press** 60lbs

**Standing alternating DB Curls** 40lbs

**Standing DB Shrugs** 60 lbs

Usually sneak a lil super set of 3x5 Step Burpees and high knees here to keep heart rate up

3x10 Superset

**Under Hand assisted pull-ups** 55lbs of counter weight. 

**Assisted Dips** 10lbs counter weight(Recently become strong/light enough to do this w/o assistance but I find my legs swing all over the place..) 

**Ab Machine** 130lbs (the one with verticle handles ahead of you that you push forward with stiff arms as you lean forward.) 

Sneak in another single set of step burpies on the way to next super set. 

3x10 Superset 

**Rope pull downs** 60lbs

**Standing Barbell curl** 60lbs (max barbell weight at gym)

**Standing shoulder press** 60lbs

3x10 Superset

**Smith shrugs** 160lbs (my traps have been a bit neglected trying to change that) 

**Standing side lateral raises** 15 lbs (New lift, shoulders have been neglected) 

**Front plate raise** 25lbs (another new lift) 

Also considering barbell rows or maybe another back excercise?

Otherwise thats about it, I hit up a few more sets of step burpees then go to the true stretch for my stretching routine and if I'm feelin it on my weekends I'll do a recovery pace jog on the elliptical.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Every day:**  
School yard stretch routine & 5~10 minute jump rope session.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Closing:**

Right now my top priorities are weight loss, correcting muscle imbalances, gaining mobility & building muscle.  My routines tend to stay static too long as I'm a creature of habit so I've tried to develop a kind of all encompassing routine but I know how much my inflexibility is holding me back and I've been working on getting out of my comfort zone lately.

[Progress pictures](https://i.imgur.com/tARBz9M.jpg) (Summer 2016 - Summer 2017 - December 2018)

I have been looking forward to doing this for a long time but due to certain circumstances, I can't be up to date with my pictures. The last picture shows me in my first proper bulk. I wanted to add another one of me during my first cut, however, I haven't been able to enter that phase yet since I am on the shelf after a surgery.

&#x200B;

**Initial** **Motivation**

I have started lifting in September 2017. Before that? I was an absolute couch potato. When doctors asked me if I was active in any way, I said yeah. However, I was referring to those weekly 2 hours of playing football at school. I ate so much unhealthy food, played videogames all day, rarely drank water, watched series all day long and slept very little. I was kinda overweight with 83 kg ( in my opinion). In 2017 I wanted to lose weight for the summer, but ended up gaining another 13 kg in August. When my clothes wouldn't fit anymore, I decided that I need to change something in my life. I actually just wanted to undergo a certain type of diet in order to lose weight, but my big bro convinced me to have a tryout workout with him. He tried to drag me to the inside of a gym for ages and that's when I gave in.

&#x200B;

**The first months**

I didn't like it at first...it was okay. At least I was doing something for my weight, I was thinking to myself. Months passed and I slowly saw some progress and that's when I became more and more dedicated.

At first, I was only doing what my brother told me to do. He didn't like the full-body workouts, which is why I did some split workouts with him for months...you know; chest, arms, shoulders, back and legs. 5 times a week. It was difficult to stay disciplined but I got very competitive and stuck with it.

Sets and reps? Oh boy! I wasn't able to do any of those! My brother was extremely surprised when I skipped the shoulder military press machine because I wasn't able to do it, even without the weights. I remember thinking that I would be able to do 50 kg at bench-pressing without any difficulties. In the end, my brother had to remove all of the weights and I was only able to do a couple of reps...no sets.

With time passing I was slowly able to put up some weights on the machines and bars...starting at 1.25 kg on each side, to a maximum of 5 kg - which was huge for me. The exercises we did were the typical exercises you see at the gym: bicep curls, tricep pushdowns, bench press, lat pulldowns, bench press, squats, etc. Unfortunately, I didn't write my progress down back then. I can tell you, however, that I wasn't gaining many muscles, I knew I was doing something wrong. I was just losing weight. That's when I started to pay more attention to my diet. I will get to that later.

**The real gains?**

In the summer of 2018, I got skinnier. I dropped down from 96 kg to 78 kg. I paid attention to my diet, stuck to my brother's workout plan and went regularly to the gym (5 times a week). I wanted to try out something new, I wanted more muscles (yeah, sounds stupid, I know); I wanted a better outcome! In July 2018 I decided that I wanted to bulk. I knew nothing about that, I thought that you could eat whatever you wanted and that it would be fine as long as I kept lifting. Oh hell no. Unfortunately, I did that until September 2018 and yeah, I gained weight and I strongly believe that I wasn't doing any good for my muscles: I started to lose strength and that affected my motivation.

Therefore I downloaded MyFitnessPal in October 2018 and I started to track down everything. I finally saw some proper progress and results!

&#x200B;

**Numbers?**

I know that I said that I was seeing some proper progress but keep in mind; I was never and will probably never able to fully commit my life into lifting. Unfortunately, I have too many things happening around me in order for me to do that.

In October 2018 I changed my workout plan, I started to do the following, which was suggested to me in this subreddit by u/berserkr15 (love you, brother. I changed it up a little bit tho)

*Monday (Upper-body : chest-focused):*Bench 5x5 (BEST: 90 kg)Pull-ups 4x8 (I  changed this to the assisted T-Row, since my shoulders were totally in pain during pull-ups. I usually do 4x10. BEST here: 32.5 kg)Side-lateral dumbbell raises 4x10 (BEST: 8kg each side)Seated machine chest flies 4x10 (BEST: 60 kg)Shrugs 4x10-12 (BEST: 30 kg)Seated machine shoulder press 4x8 (BEST: 12.5 kg. Really unhappy with my progress here. I feel like I should be able to do more here)

*Tuesday (Lower-body : Hamstring and calves-focused):*Deadlifts 3x5 (BEST: 120 kg)Calf raises 4x12 (BEST: 70 kg)Walking lunges 3x (distance you wish to cover) (Uhm...I don't know. I think I was able to do it with 16 dumbbells)Seated hamstring curls 4x10 (We don't have this machine in our gym, so I replaced it with other exercises)\*Bicep exercise 4x10 (for example curls - BEST: 14 kg)

ATTENTION: In addition to that I always did another biceps exercise. For example preacher curls.\*Triceps exercise 4x12 (for example rope push down. BEST here: 40 kg)

ATTENTION: In addition to that I always did another triceps exercise. For example skull crusher.

&#x200B;

*Wednesday (REST)*

&#x200B;

*Thursday (Upper-body : Back and shoulders-focused):*Barbell rows 5x5 (BEST: 90 kg)Incline dumbbell press 4x10 (BEST: 24 kg for each dumbbell)Overhead press 5x5 (BEST: 50 kg)Lateral pulldowns 4x10 (BEST: 45 kg)Upper-chest flies 4x10 (BEST: 30 kg)Rear-delt dumbbell flies 4x12 (BEST: 14 kg for each dumbbell)

*Friday (Lower-body : Quads-focused)*Squats 5x5 (BEST: 130 kg)Close-stance leg press 3x12 (BEST: 70 kg)Romanian dumbbell deadlift 4x8 (BEST: 18 kg for each dumbbell)\*Abs exercise 4x12\*Bicep exercise 4x10 (for example incline curls. BEST: 10 kg for each dumbbell)\*Triceps exercise 4x10 (for example close grip bench press. BEST: 60 kg)

&#x200B;

*Saturday & Sunday (REST)*

**Injuries**

In February of this year, I tore my ACL and my meniscus at the same time. I had to pause for 2 weeks, then my doctors allowed me to keep lifting as long as I didn't use my legs - so I have been lifting only seated or lying and mostly with machines only. It was fine but I would have loved to keep going with my usual exercises. I tore my muscles during a football game with my friends, I was just running around and then my knee kind of exploded. My surgery was scheduled for 2 months after that since in terms of pain and immobility I was doing fine. Actually, I underwent surgery last week. Only my meniscus was repaired and I will soon start with the physiotherapy. The doctors said that even though my ACL had been torn my knee was doing fine in terms of stability. This is why they decided to keep it like that for now.

I also have a shoulder injury which has been bugging me for months during my workouts. I think it happened during pull-ups. Now that I am finally taking a break, I hope that my shoulder will heal up simultaneously.

&#x200B;

**Diet and sleep**

I eat up to 2700 cal daily, sometimes 3000 cal. At this very moment, I weigh 90.6 kg.  I eat between 130 and 150 g proteins daily. 100 g of fat and +300 g carbs. No alcohol, no drugs. No junk food. No soft drinks, no energy drinks, nothing. Currently, I am not bulking or cutting, I am just trying to hold my weight until I can get back at it again. I used to only sleep between 5 and 6 hours and also eat at night. I try to avoid this at all costs and during the last months of my workouts I have regularly slept up to 9 hours every night.

&#x200B;

**Summary**

I can't wait to get back to the gym. I am nowhere near the point that I actually want to reach. I am still so incredibly motivated and I strongly believe that I will be back very soon. I will stronger and better than ever. I would have NEVER thought that I would fall in love with this. My life made a 180-degree turn. To all my chubby motherfuckers out there. Being fat, chubby and all that is cool, to a certain point. However, hear me out: being fit is so much better (and yes, it helps with the ladies). I regret every gram of junk food I have ever eaten. I wish that I had started earlier with this. I feel so much better now and seeing my friends and making some progress keeps me motivated and happy. And don't worry, I know that I am not doing everything perfectly. I am probably making lots and lots of mistakes that will make me cringe in a couple of years. I am still learning!

bauzvv,Fitness,How to keep body fat low when pumping?,"Hello,

I‚Äôve been going to the gym for a month. I‚Äôm 27 years old and 5‚Äô7 in height. My weight was 57 kilograms but now raised to over 60 kilograms. My recent body fat is %8. I work out four days a week from 9 PM to 10.30 PM.

I‚Äôm skinny. The reason why I dropped to such low weight is that I aimed to bring out my jawline and lose my mild double chin, which I tend to develop as I gain weight.

Now that I‚Äôm skinny, I focus on building a muscular body and pumping so that I no longer look like a kid. I was told to increase my intake of calories by eating more carbonhydrates and protein and to avoid sugar, alcohol, junk food etc.

As recommended, I eat more than usual, but I‚Äôm afraid of my jawline disappearing and my double chin reappearing at the end of this process. Some people say they won‚Äôt happen because I will be gaining muscle at the same time and it will even affect the shape of my face. What do you think? What should I do? How to eat more while keeping body fat low? How to eat healthy while gaining muscle growth?

*****

Below is my daily diet:

Breakfast

60 gr of oatmeal, one large banana, three or four strawberries and 250 ml of yogurt, all mixed in a bowl +++ 4 eggs +++ 50 gr of roasted and frozen red meat +++ Some amount of nuts including walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds etc. +++ 9-10 olives

Lunch:

Either a bowl of spaghetti bolognese or a platter of chicken with some French fries and lettuce.

Dinner:

I consume two hand-sized pieces of chicken after workout (around 11PM)

Occasioanally I consume 500 ml of milk at night.

I go out for a drink every Saturday and drink two or three glasses of red wine or beer depending on my mood.

aqyvnx,Fitness,Struggling with physically intense job. (UPS package loader),"Hi all,

I work at UPS as a package loader. We fill the brown cars that you see driving around all day. I have been working there since last October and have been struggling with general exhaustion and muscle fatigue every day. Rarely pain unless really overworked. I am starting to burn out and when I discussed it with my boss he said that it should have only taken 2 weeks for my body to adjust to the physical demands of the job, (Questionable?), it has been 5 months. 

This is the first time in my life I have exercised heavily and regularly and could use any advice on how to make this more sustainable. The job is only part time, but I find myself being so exhausted that I am unable to do anything else with my day.

‚Äî 
Below here is a list of details about diet, work load, etc. 
‚Äî

I am 5‚Äô 10‚Äù and currently averaging 162 each week with expected variations. I started work in October weighing 180. I have not only seen weight loss but muscle growth in shoulders, arms, and legs.

The jobs consists of loading 1000-1400 packages a day. The packages that I carry without aid are from 1-80 pounds of every size imaginable. Some days are heavier than others. Tuesday and Thursday always being heaviest. I bring these packages down from a moving bin at just above chest height and lift them anywhere from the ground to above my head. I am doing all I can to ensure lifting form and physical safety concerns. (Aka bend knees, don‚Äôt twist back, keep package close, etc.) Motion is a brisk walk at all times.I step up about 3 feet to climb up into the package bins.  (My iPhone stats average 7-10 miles a day, stairs climbed is laughably inconsistent!) A shift last 5-6 hours with no breaks.

I sleep 6-8 hours a night, often I find myself napping during the day though I try not too. 

I hydrate as much as I can usually, 20-40oz per shift. Water only. I try to balance it so I do not lose to much time peeing. I make sure to hydrate heavily at home.

I generally eat two large meals a day, ensuring protein in both meals. I do not eat before work or during work. I eat varying things, but try to not to get to heavy in carbs, always have veggies, and protein. I eat out/have junk no more than twice a week but break sometimes and have junk when desperate for calories/stressed. 

I stretch before, during, and after work. 

Thank you for any and all advice. I have tried tweaking all these elements but am struggling to see the big picture.

Edit: I thought I found a balance with eating because my weight stabilized, but clearly not. I will eat more and find a calorie tracker to keep myself honest. I feel silly for this but I am new. When I first started reading the wiki I struggled to compare the workload to both the clear work out routines and intensity level calorie calculators. How would I classify a workout routine like this?

Edit edit: I will eat more carbs, come at me spaghetti.

Edit edit edit: I downloaded myFitnessPall. Today I had Chinese, a lot of chips and cookies, and multiple beers and still came out 600 calories short. Wow!

Edit x4: The junk food was an exception, I posted it because I was amazed at how much crap I ate and how many calories I still needed. I don‚Äôt eat like that often. 

Thank you everyone for all the advice, keep it coming if you have more I am learning a lot!",2019-02-15 17:23:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/aqyvnx/struggling_with_physically_intense_job_ups/

Main things I want to achieve is better posture, relieve pain, maybe lose the gut, and of course some strength.

If you could recommend a 5 min workout I can do every hour 10 times per day what would it be?

Im about 210 lbs, 6FT and did I mention I have bad posture?

&#x200B;

Gym is really not an option, due to changing schedule every day.

&#x200B;

I eat anywhere between 1000-3000 calories per day. Sometimes probably even more due to junk food, sweets, and cola which I can get rid off without a problem.

ajn6h4,Fitness,Is a 9 hour sleep cycle more Important than the time spent working out?,"I'm a 17 year old vocational student and started going to the gym 6 days a week for the past 2 weeks. Last year was a real low for my general health because before I went to high school, I was really fit. I was in a basketball team and trained 5 days a week averaging 10-12 hours of exercise a week. When I started studying at my new school, I decided to quit basketball altogether for many reasons, I didn't properly exercise for a year and lost connections with my old team mates. I was staying up late until 3 AM studying and ate a lot of junk food. I gained 40 pounds. got more depressed.

&#x200B;

Currently I'm 188 cm weighing 95 kg with a lot of belly fat, lost 3 kg since I started exercising and generally a lot more happier. I don't do any extreme diets, just stopped eating junk food and started eating healthier while counting my calories.

&#x200B;

Last night I was sleepwalking for the first time ever in my life and wondered if It had anything to do with my sleeping and exercising schedule. I go to school from 7 am to 3.30 pm. I started eating dinner earlier at 4.30 pm so I could go to the gym and start exercising from 6.30 to 9.00. I go to sleep around 10-11 pm and wake up at 5 am.

I heard recently that a 9 hour sleep cycle is one of the most Important things in regards to building muscles and losing weight. Since I go to school until 4 the only time available for me is working out at night.

I do low to high intensity cardio workout for 45 minutes, after that I do semi-intense strength workout for 45 min, and 30 minute core workout. I cooldown, come home around 9.30 and take a shower. I eventually fall asleep around 11 pm.

&#x200B;

Do you recommend I slash my workout to an hour and prioritize my sleep, or is 6 hours of sleep enough? I usually take a 45-60 minute nap time at my school cause we get a 90 minute lunch time.

I am 21 stone and 6ft tall age 20.
 So I started a new fitness regime more than a week ago. I have been going to the gym every day lifting weights usually, 5 reps 5 sets of whatever I'm doing with the highest weight I can manage, I have also started walking about 2 miles a day ( can't jog or run yet). With this I understood nutrition is key so I started meal preping. 2 meals a day (I usually skipped breakfast even before starting this) , each meal around 800 calories with chicken. Rice baby carrots and peas sometimes with broccoli. I have tracked this on myfitnesspal so I assume everything is correct. The problem I am having is after I eat my fist meal around 1pm I am not hungry for the rest of the day, I just don't feel like eating the second meal at all, and i was a person to eat a lot of junk food and never feel full hence why I got so heavy. Now I know this is probably beneficial the less food I eat the more fat I will lose right? But I am wondering if this reaction is normal at first or something may be wrong with me.

I got on the scale when I got home, and I lost significantly more weight than I normally do. It seems to happen basically every time I have a significant cheat meal, and my run was easier too. My normal diet is modified keto, where I eat a keto-esque lunch and dinner. I usually just have black coffee for breakfast.

Background: I've been trying various things to lose fat‚Äîmostly calorie cutting plus exercise, and recently mild carb restriction. I try to eat a fairly balanced diet and have gradually cut my junk food consumption. Until recently I was only measuring on the bathroom scale.

I often got discouraged when I wouldn't lose a single pound in weeks even though I was doing all the right things. So I recently got back on the horse, so to speak, and have been experimenting a little with my method.

Findings: After getting at least 30 minutes of exercise everyday including some strength training, eating 1200 net calories (my metabolism is very slow), reducing carbs and measuring my waist and hips, my weight has only fluctuated up and down a pound, but my waist size has dropped two inches, and my hips one over the course of a week!

Hello people, I am a 17 years old guy currently standing at 59.5 kgs and 175cms. I have always been very skinny due to neglecting sleep and eating for several years because of what was defined depression. I feel way better now and I guess I really have to thank working out for this because it makes me feel very well, of course.  I have started working out the 20th April with dedication and without taking breaks, starting at 54.5kgs and pretty much no muscles because I didnt practice sports for years. I wasnt very motivated at first because I would 2 kgs dumbbells for biceps and stuff like this made me realize how weak I was and this made me even less motivated. I kept going, trained 3 times a week at my local gym for about 2 months followed by a trainer because he was scared I could injure myself for how skinny and weak I was(i still am pretty skinny in my opinion but atleast i dont make trainers worried now). I stopped for like 2 weeks because of vacations and then started training again until august 4 times a week, during august the gym closed so I started working out at home 6 times a week (i didnt do these schedules randomly, they were all used by someone before me and they werent some random shit threw all together hoping they would work. I can provide them in comments or edit if it is important). I kept training 6 times a week until one week ago where I decided to start boxing, I always had a thing for it but I was too lazy to practice it. The thing is, boxe is 2 times a week for 1 hour and a half, and I felt it wasnt much, coming from someone that trained 6 times a week(dont wanna seem cocky but thats how i feel) so right now I was planning on doing work out home or at the gym monday wednesday friday and boxing tuesday and thursday. So thats how about it for the training part. During these 5 months I have gotten some results that made me proud of and the simple fact that I gained weight and also added weights to my lifts means that it is working. But I feel like it is not working as much as it should? Im definitely a  beginner so I may be just impatient and insecure about it but I see people around me my age adding mass faster and better. I dont think its because of an incorrect died because I dont eat junk food and I eat healthy I believe, my parents are both pharmacists so they know a little about whats good for my body. I felt an augment in my hunger after i started training but i eat whenever i feel hungry so i dont think thats the issue. Am I just too impatient? Should I just wait? I see people working out 5 months and getting way better results than me and faster. Although I AM seeing results that make me proud, I feel like I could be getting them faster. Please tell me if I have to add more pics Im not an expert of these posts. Literally tell me if i need to change anything. Thanks in advance.

9mn98h,Fitness,Problems Faced With Losing Weight In Wrong Methods,"By Stephanie Perry
   
   
In recent times, we see lots of people who are overweight and obese. When we think of the reasons and solutions for the same, we come across various techniques. But almost all people look for the remedy that lasts longer or forever helps them reduce fat. Hence, they look for [permanent weight loss solution](https://www.donna-oleary.com/about-me/).
   
   
 First of all, let us imagine going through the street on a weekend. We come across a lot of people who are fat. The number is only increasing day by day and this unwanted change is happening at an alarming rate. All the people do not stay together in the same place. They do not do the same work or do not eat the same food.
   
   
 The problem has to be addressed from the roots and only then it will not reoccur. If it is the case of school going children, knowledge should be provided as to which is healthy and which is junk food. Most schools have issued instructions to parents not to send junk food as a snack or lunch. Warnings are issued to students who violate it.
   
   
 For example, a person in the eastern nation is working for a western country. The time zones of both the countries are different. So, the person who works is supposed to work when he is supposed to sleep as per the laws of nature. Some jobs, like nurses, duty doctors, and customer care personnel work in shifts or round the clock.
   
   
 Maybe only for kids, easy to make recipes can be prepared at the last moment. Many times, the working people have no time to pack their food. Since cabs are linked amongst various routes, a lot of time is wasted on a journey and they have to be on time at the designated stops. But in Western countries, this problem is less to a certain extent due to the usage of cars to commute.
   
   
 Diabetes and hypertension are very common and seen even among youngsters. Also, having food with friends at the office and late night parties lead to deposition of fat in the body. Especially, heavy dinner at nights is the culprit of obesity. This is because there is not much activity in the night after food.
   
   
 In addition to this, the quality of food served in restaurants and hotels these days is very bad. Few of them purchase the leftover vegetables to prepare food. In addition, these are fried in oil at higher temperatures. They are also reheated at times depending on the item ordered.
   
   
 On top of this, they used artificial colors, additives, and preservatives which are detrimental to the health of human beings. Maximum profitability with minimum resources is their business formula. So, it is better to avoid foods sold outside. Especially, the ones with preservatives are strict NO if you really want to stay fit. A healthy diet, being the primary thing and exercise accompanying it is the only and long lasting way to reduce obesity without side effects.
   
   
 All this gets washed out of our mind once we are hungry and not much time left out for eating. Also, we should get a regular checkup done to know the Body Mass Index and other health factors. Sudden surprises like massive heart attacks are among the ones which happen all of a sudden.

9hn0mg,Fitness,Three months into working out and Calorie control and am getting disheartened.,"Indian woman living in India, vegetarian, 163 cms and 193 pounds (87.7 Kgs). Started my fitness Journey early June at 195 pounds. During this duration, I joined a Gym, got a personal trainer and worked out on an average 3 times a week with 45 minutes of strength training and about 30 mins of Cardio. Started logging my food, changed what I eat based on high protein requirements and cut out fats. Was never into major junk food (carried food from home at work and eat out only about 3 times a week), so that was easy to give up. Cut my calories down from 1800 to about 1400. 

&#x200B;

This is what my InBoby analysis has to show for these three months. 

Over all Weight loss = 2 pounds

Muscle Mass gain = 4.6 pounds

Body Fat Mass loss = 9.2 Pounds.

BMI dropped slightly

BMR up considerably.

&#x200B;

Though i can feel the loss of a few inches, apparently most people around me still do not see that difference. This week, perhaps due to my menstrual periods being due I seemed to have gained back the 2 pounds I have lost. I find myself frustrated and impatient that despite all the hard work, the progress seems to be slower then what I am told is the expected response to all the actions I am taking.

&#x200B;

Can someone tell me what am I still doing wrong?",2018-09-21 07:08:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9hn0mg/three_months_into_working_out_and_calorie_control/
9hl41m,Fitness,Paying For Top Skin Care Services Denver Provides In Order To Remain Looking Young,"By Patricia Wood
   
   
The skin can age at a much faster rate than normal if you have a very stressful life. This is true most especially if you also have poor eating habits and an unhealthy lifestyle. The regular consumption of junk foods, intake of excessive alcohol and partying all night long can definitely leave you looking older than your real age. In order to bring back your youthfulness, consider getting excellent [skin care services Denver](https://www.grand-salon.com/skincare-services/) day spas and dermatological clinics are providing.
   
   
 Currently, there is a plethora of beauty products available on the market. There is a solution that you may buy for every cosmetic issue you are having. For instance, you may purchase an anti aging cream if you have fine lines and wrinkles. You may get your hands on a hydrating serum if excess dryness is the problem.
   
   
 For people who are shopping on a budget, there are lots of inexpensive and natural substitutes to those commercially available remedies for a wide variety of beauty woes. Many of them can be spotted in the average household kitchen. As an example, lemon juice is very good for dealing with acne. Egg whites, on the other hand, can tighten the face.
   
   
 Certain plants found in the average garden may also be employed as beauty solutions straight from nature. As an example, you may use aloe vera gel for dealing with unsightly scars and pesky pimples. On the other hand, it's possible to gently rub fresh basil leaves on acne because the aromatic oils within them possess anti bacterial abilities.
   
   
 Other than relying on these solutions, it is also highly recommended for you to visit a day spa or dermatological clinic one in a while. In such establishment, you can pay for treatments that are capable of intensively dealing with any beauty issue that you may be having. A lot day spas and dermatological clinics these days also utilize innovative tools whose provided results cannot be rivaled by any available product or home remedy.
   
   
 Generally speaking, seeking professional help is recommended most especially if you are a beauty conscious individual. So many simple cosmetic issues can easily end up as serious matters due to improper management at home. With the help of an expert, a minor cosmetic setback can be kept from evolving into something that can take away your self confidence and also leave reminders that can haunt you for life, such as scars and an uneven tone.
   
   
 It's excellent news for all beauty conscious people to know that there are so many establishments currently that provide specialized services. Such only means that obtaining aesthetic perfection is one bus ride away. This also means, however, that it can be difficult to look for an establishment where you can pay for services that you can be fully happy with.
   
   
 Before you pay any establishment in the area a visit, do your homework first. Get the recommendations of your family members and friends, in particular those whose skin looks fantastic. You may also check out customer ratings and reviews posted on the internet beforehand.

9hdpol,Fitness,Should I eat more junk food?,"Ok, so I'm a 20 year old 180cm male. I'm 145 pounds(66 kg) and skinny fat. Been going to the gym for about 2 months now. The problem is I'm staying at a hostel and I really don't have access to good food. Most of what I eat is not processed, but still not exactly ideal for muscle building either. So a few days ago I heard about the ""g flux"" phenomenon. It basically says eat more and workout more. That's what athletes apparently do. I'm looking for an athletic(lean muscular) look, so I'm trying to up my calorie intake. The g flux thing really appeals to me because of the lifestyle that I'm leading right now. The problem is I've got a pretty much (un)healthy relationship with walking. Because I'm always walking, like all the time. Sometimes even when I'm eating. The only time I sit are during my classes. 10000 steps a day feels like child's play to me, honestly. I also hit the gym hard monday to friday. On top of that I play volleyball for about two hours on saturday and sunday. Losing weight is actually very easy to me. I actually have to force myself to  eat in the afternoon. Also, I can't cook my own food, because there simply isn't time.
I should also mention that I haven't even started barbell training as of now. I moved to a different gym after 1 month so i had to start all over again with the machines in my new gym.
So, in light of all this, I would like to ask: am i overdoing my training? Should I eat as much unprocessed food as I can and complement that with more junk food than I'm eating now? Would it adversely affect my strength? Since I'm skinny fat, would the amount of food I eat just contribute to my belly fat instead of helping me gain muscle? I am an absolute novice in all things fitness so your advice would be much appreciated.",2018-09-20 09:05:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9hdpol/should_i_eat_more_junk_food/
9gw4rk,Fitness,How can I balance cardio and weightlifting for my current body goals! Advice appreciated!,"A little background: I‚Äôm a 29F and over the past 18 months I‚Äôve lost about 60lbs (started at 178, currently at 120) through exercise and eating healthy (no special diet, no calorie counting, literally just portion control & stopped eating fast food, processed food, junk food, soda & alcohol). 

Most of my weight loss has been attributed to HIIT training and cardio. However, now that I‚Äôm about my desired weight I realized I was becoming sort of ‚Äúskinny fat‚Äù and have since started implementing weightlifting, which I enjoy. 

 Currently I go to the gym 3-5x/week, for about an hour and do mostly compound exercises. I love weightlifting and have been seeing results from it, but I really miss running! 

My question is: how can I balance running (I can run about 4-5 miles at a time) with weightlifting? I was told that doing cardio AFTER a weightlifting sesh isn‚Äôt effective and can hinder the weightlifting results/progress. 

I really do love and enjoy weightlifting, and feel like it‚Äôs what I need (as opposed to cardio, which is more of an enjoyment/stress relief) to achieve my goals, but I miss doing cardio. Due to my hectic schedule, I mostly dedicate my gym sessions to weightlifting (going more than 5x/week isn‚Äôt really an option as some weeks going 3x is challenging enough!) 

Does doing cardio after weight lifting inhibit the effects of weightlifting? Could I do cardio before weight lifting and still maximize the effects of weight lifting (although it may make me too tired for a good weight lifting session)? I‚Äôm afraid if I trade a few of my weightlifting days for cardio it‚Äôll slow down my progress (which IMO is already a little slow), but I really do miss that runners high. 

What can I do to balance my enjoyment of cardio while still implementing enough weightlifting to achieve my goals??? 

Advice and suggestions appreciated! 

Thanks in advance!!

9ggczg,Fitness,Question about bulking,"I'm a 17 year old who has been working out 5 days a week for the past 2 months. I'm really into it now, and have started meal prepping in order to get over my daily caloric intake. But I've noticed something, and I'm wondering if what I'm inferring is possible.

Prior to this summer, I can't count the calories of my past meals exactly, but it seems like my average day consisted of roughly 1000 calories. Weekends I had 1 can of chunky soup, a little bit of junk food, and a 2 course dinner, not over stuffing myself.

Before I started working out, I weighed roughly 128lbs.

I now weigh 134.5 lbs

When u started working out, I started eating more than normal, and since I started meal prepping last week, I've been stuffing myself every day. I've never eaten so much in a day. But when counting my calories, I get 2300 if I'm lucky. 2300 if I'm trying my hardest to eat as much as I can. My daily goal is 3000.

My question is, since I've stayed at roughly 125lbs for a while before I started working out on a small diet, is it possible that I can gain weight by taking in less than 3000 calories? It seems to me that I don't need as many calories as the average 17 year old, but I'm not an expert. ",2018-09-17 02:06:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9ggczg/question_about_bulking/
9fckel,Fitness,"Thinking about going to a gym, despite hating the idea. Any tips to get over the mind set?","There's quite a lot I'd like to ask and talk about here, and I'm not sure where to start, so I think I'll explain the '*hating the idea*' bit first.

I am pretty introverted, and I don't like crowds. I wouldn't call it full blown [Agoraphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agoraphobia), but I know I can get claustrophobic and for me the sensation can be the same. That said, I can sit in meetings and ride on the London Underground OK.
But all in all, the idea of going to a gym is quite off putting, and it's something I have avoided in the past (more on that in a minute)

I suppose the other thing is the fear or being judged. I can try to rationalise it away by telling my self that ""*everyone else is focused on what they are doing, no one is paying attention to me.**"" The rational part of me *knows* this. That doesn't stop the fear that someone is going to see whatever it is I'm doing and be silently judging me.

**So, moving on to the situation at hand.** I know I need to improve my fitness. I'm not all that un-fit as I walk 2 miles to and from work each day (4 miles a day), which I do 5 days a week. I also do traditional Japanese Ju-Jitsu (not the more energetic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) which I am a qualified coach for. The downside of being a coach is that more often than not I'm stood or sat beside someone watching what they are doing rather than doing it myself. Occasionally I can be a student on the mat if another coach is around to take the class, so I'll get a little more exercise there.

The rest of the time though is quite sedentary. I work in a school to much of my time is sat with pupils or in an office behind a desk. Even at home I can be at my computer a lot doing work, or putting too much time into *Fallout 4*.

I don't eat a great deal of junk food or sweets/candy. I make my own lunch most days, only getting store brought on days I'm either running late in the morning or when I need to go food shopping anyway. I'm not keen on fruits but I make up for it in vegetables, and I am somewhat a ""half-vegetarian"" in that I try to avoid any meat 3-4 times a week. I also don't drink (used to but stopped 4 years ago) and have never smoked.

Net result? The so-called 'beer belly'. Fat round my waist, most notably at the front. I currently weigh 177lbs / 80.3kg / 12st 9lbs, and at 5'10"" / 1.78m, that puts my BMI at 25.3. According to the NHS that just about tips me into the 'overweight' range'. Yes I know the BMI is a really bad tool, but when trying to explain to people on the internet it's better than nothing.
By that same tool though, I ideally need to drop about 20-28lbs / 9.5-12.7kg / 1.5-2st

My primary goal is to lose the belly. I'm not after a totally flat stomach or a 6 pack, I just don't want to look like I'm 5 months pregnant any more. I have made some efforts in the past to this. I downloaded various apps for my phone to track my progress and to count calories. I picked up a small dumbbell set to do some stuff at home. I used to walk/jog a 5 mile route around town once a week until I got my current job, where I'm now walking at least 20 miles a week.

Evidently though they have not been enough, and even though I hate the idea of going to the gym, that is what I'm now considering.

**This what I have in mind.** I am going to look at websites for and hopefully look at a few local gyms, mostly to see how much each costs. I plan to ask what sort of exercises would be suitable for my needs which I hope they'll be able to do better than anyone here could on a count of them being able to see me first hand.

So given all that in mind; my aims, my current weight/fitness and most importantly, feelings about going to and using gyms, what advise might anyone be able to share with me on how to get over that mental hurdle? I'm trying to think of things I would say to one of my Ju-Jitsu students about to try a new throw (or be thrown) but it's not actually helping me because in that situation, I have done those throws and received them too. I *know* what it's like and what to expect. *I can't say the same about going to a gym, so I'm asking someone else to do that for me.*

**I've tried to include a lot of detail to anticipate what people *might* ask me, but if you want any other details then just ask.**",2018-09-12 22:48:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9fckel/thinking_about_going_to_a_gym_despite_hating_the/

1e3a4fm,veganrecipes,I Meal Prepped Vegan Chocolate Cake and It Changed My Life!,"Hey fellow vegan food lovers!

So, I did something a little crazy last week - I included chocolate cake in my meal prep. I know, I know, it sounds wild, but hear me out because it's been a game-changer for my easy vegan meal prep ideas!

**Why Cake for Meal Prep?**

1. Prevents impulse buys of vegan junk food
2. Built-in portion control
3. Major time saver
4. Instant mood booster (it's chocolate cake, duh!)

**The Recipe:** (This is so easy, it's almost embarrassing)

Ingredients:

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup cocoa powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup water
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions:

1. Mix dry ingredients
2. Mix wet ingredients
3. Combine wet and dry
4. Pour into greased 8-inch pan
5. Bake at 350¬∞F for 30-35 minutes
6. Cool, then slice for meal prep

**Meal Prep Magic:**

* Slice into 9-12 pieces
* Wrap individually (I use reusable silicone bags)
* Refrigerate for 5 days or freeze for 3 months

**Keeping It Interesting:**

* Monday: Plain cake
* Tuesday: Add vegan whipped cream
* Wednesday: Sprinkle with berries
* Thursday: Drizzle with vegan chocolate sauce
* Friday: Crumble over vegan ice cream (because, Friday)

**The Results:** Guys, this has seriously upgraded my meal prep game. Having a sweet treat ready to go has:

1. Saved me from impulse-buying expensive vegan desserts
2. Helped me portion control (no more eating half a cake in one sitting... not that I've ever done that...)
3. Made my co-workers super jealous (always a plus, right?)

yvplka,veganrecipes,No Prep Dinner Ideas?,"First of all, I know this question has probably been asked a million times, but I have a really unique issue. 

Today, I seriously injured both of my hands (long and boring story). They‚Äôre both bandaged and extremely painful. This kind of puts any chopping or even stirring out of the question for at least a week, maybe up to three. Even opening a can is hard, but I think I could manage that.

The goal is to completely get away from any and all added sugars (natural sugars are fine). We have been on this quest for about a week now and have realized that buddha bowls are amazing! Pretty quick, packable for lunches, and always tastey...so now we are looking for more of them! If you could please share your favorite buddha bowl combo (with no added sugars) we would both greatly appreciate it!",2022-06-30 04:41:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/vnzpri/please_share_your_favorite_sugar_free_buddha_bowl/

1lr134f,gainit,M23 122 lbs - 150lbs 4 months,"Hello,

I lost lots of weight during the state exams of my pharmacy studies as well as a relationship with a BPD girl and the messy break up that followed. I started lifting and eating properly again after I was put on mirtazapine to deal with it all in March. I went to the gym before the whole ordeal already for quite a while, not really regularly though and I didnt eat a lot so progress was slow. But now I see some nice gains and I wanted to share.

I went with a full body workout because I was frail and just wanted to hit everything, though with little intensity. Now I want to switch it up and do some split, because I see I am lacking in some areas and I want to catch up in these areas. Id be happy to hear some suggestions! 

right now I do:
3x lat pulldown 30kg to 57kg
2-3 sets of bench press each, inclined and declined, 12kg to 22kg dumbbells
3x Tricep push down 30kg to 50kg
3-6x Lateral raises
3x assisted cable rows 15kg to25kg
either Leg extension/ leg press
3x machine butter fly 30kg to 48kg

When I started eating more I ate atleast 3k calories thanks to mirtazapine, more often than not atleast 3300 with some 4200+ days if i was drinking beer lmao. Dont really care what I am eating, just making sure to eat some kind protein 2x a day (20-30g protein each) as well as a weight gainer shake with protein milk in the evening (50g protein atleast). I also ate lots of junk tbh, and its starting to show on my belly. Thus I am looking to reduce junk food, but so far I dont mind the extra fat, since I am starting to look a healthy weight and that was my goal

Upper left was me in March, upper right end of april, and the bottom pics are from last week. I think the fact that I had built some muscle before losing it all really helped in getting back on track.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day everyone

Ps: i know i wasnt consistent with censoring, i just look mentally handicapped on the other pics

1f4zr3l,gainit,23M 160->225->205lb 2.5yr (5‚Äô11) ,"2.5 year progress update. Bulked for majority of the time with small instances of maintenance, and have been cutting excess body fat the last 3 months.

Diet: Beginning the bulk my diet was not the best, relying on copious amounts of whole milk, red meat, eggs, pasta, rice, potatoes, and a whole lot of junk foods. Aiming for low 3,000s calories, 0.8-1g per lb of body weight protein. Looking back I believe I bulked too fast and too hard and tacked on excess fat, making cutting a little bit of a pain.

Training: juggled between PPL and chest and side delts, back and rear delts, arms, and legs split. Aiming for 8-12 hard sets per muscle group per day. Focused on compound lifts in the 3-5x5 rep range followed by accessory movements in the 8-15 rep range. 

Takeaways: As long as you‚Äôre eating in a surplus, the two most important things for gaining muscle I believe are consistency and intensity. If you make sure you‚Äôre in the gym 3-6 times a week and train near to failure, you will grow. Try and avoid going too hard on the junk foods in the name of seeing the scale go up, you‚Äôll end up a bloatlord and the cut will take a lot more effort.",2024-08-30 16:37:31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f4zr3l
1e5l2vd,gainit,Had to lose to gain: From 201 to 165 to 181 in 16ish months with no calorie/macro counting,"Greetings Gainers,

* Wanted to put my money where my mouth was and show off [my transformation process](https://i.redd.it/r8s2kzruewbd1.jpeg) over the course of almost 1.5 years of training and nutritional overhaul.


**SUMMARY UP FRONT**

* Never counted calories or macros.  Transitioned from eating a diet full of keto junk food (‚Äúketo friendly‚Äù tortillas, breads, bagels, pasta, sauces, sweeteners, cookies/cakes/brownies, protein/keto bars, flavored nutbutters) and filler veggies to a carnivore approach to eating paired with protein shakes for a protein sparing modified fast.  Made use of a 2 week cut/4 week bulk style of eating for a vast majority of my losing and gaining.  Changed up my form on a lot of exercises.  Used a LOT of different programs (Mass Made Simple and Easy Strength, Jamie Lewis‚Äô ‚ÄúFeast, Famine and Ferocity‚Äù and ‚ÄúJuggeryoke‚Äù, DoggCrapp, and some self-designed programs).


**BACKGROUND**


* The first photo is of me at a bodyweight of 201lbs at 5‚Äô9 on 2 Mar 2023.  The second photo is me at around 165lbs in mid July of 2023, and the final photo was taken last week, July of 2024, weighing in around 181lbs, having gained up as high as 185 in the previous month.  And I want to point out that, through this whole process, I‚Äôve never counted a calorie or macro.  I‚Äôve never found it necessary.


* In the photo of me at 201, I had just completed Super Squats (this was my third run, which I did a write up of [here](
https://old.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/11go5su/program_review_super_squats_3_the_revenge/) and was eating, honestly, just terribly.  I‚Äôve always been ‚Äúlow carb‚Äù, but in my pursuit of keeping carbs low, I was eating a LOT of ‚Äúketo junk‚Äù.  ‚ÄúKeto friendly‚Äù tortillas, breads, bagels, brownies/cookies/treats, flavored peanut/almond butter spreads, quest/keto bars, artificial sweeteners out the yin/yang, tons of sugar free energy drinks, etc etc.  I was also eating a lot of vegetables because, for some reason, I was ALWAYS hungry, and, in turn, my guts were an absolute wreck from all the artificial garbage paired with all the fiber.  I was putting away a lot of ‚Äúfood like objects‚Äù to get in growth, and I was also having about 6 bloody bowel movements a day to fuel that.  I could not sustain living like that, despite how big and strong I became.


* To reset myself, I took on the T-nation [Velocity Diet](https://t-nation.com/t/velocity-diet-plan/278605), which I‚Äôd read about previously in Dan John‚Äôs ‚ÄúNever Let Go‚Äù book (an amazing read: please do yourself a favor and go pick it up), and ended up merging it with Jamie Lewis‚Äô **NSFW** [Apex Predator Diet]( https://plagueofstrength.com/predator-diet-in-glorious-detail-part-1/) in order to form my own amalgamation.  Effectively, I had a hybrid carnivore diet, wherein I‚Äôd engage in a daily protein sparing modified fast using protein shakes during the day, and then a big ‚Äúmeat on the bone‚Äù meal in the evening.  This had me lose [13.5lbs in 43 days]( https://old.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/12n65u3/m3759187lbs_down_135lbs_in_43_days_with_my_family/), which is slightly longer than the originally slated 28 day run of the Velocity Diet, but this approach to nutrition ended up forming my baseline that I STILL use to this day.


* I continued employing the Apex Predator Diet approach while my weight continued to drop, to include some pretty epic ‚ÄúRampage Day‚Äù meals (like the time I ate a [5lb cheeseburger in 30 minutes](https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1376k7e/tomorrow_4_may_i_have_45_minutes_to_eat_a_5lb/) before settling into another one of Jamie‚Äôs nutrition and training protocols: the [Feast, Famine and Ferocity diet](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/13ibvjv/program_review_jamie_lewis_updated_feast_famine/).  This differed from Apex Predator because it employed a cyclical approach to nutrition.  There are 2 weeks of famine and 4 weeks of feasting, with the former being a more restricted version of the PSMF from the Apex Predator Diet and the latter being simply unrelenting gluttony.  I used the latter opportunity to effective allow myself 2 solid meals a day on top of all of the shakes compared to my previous 1 solid meal a day approach.  It also included a training plan that coincided with the diet, with a 2 week famine protocol and 4 week feast protocol.


* I ended up REALLY digging the cyclical dietary protocol, and employed all the way to that middle weight of 165 ([here]( https://old.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/13yyagy/down_25lbs_in_3_months_m3759from_201_to_176_with/) I was at the 3 months mark on 2 Jun of that year at 175lbs), AND employed it to also gain back up to the weight of 185.  It was simply a matter of really leaning into the feasting portion when it came time to feast.  At this point, I was fully embracing the carnivore approach to eating, as my guts felt incredible in the absence of all of the keto junk and the plant foods.  A return to just meat and eggs had gone a long way, and when it came time to gain, I‚Äôd up my intake of animal fats and start allowing in some dairy in the form of cheeses, grassfed sour cream and ghee.  


* I made use of various programs along the way, to include spending 2 weeks [pretending that I was a Viking]( https://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2023/06/to-valhalla-let-your-training-tell-story.html) Dan John‚Äôs [Mass Made Simple]( https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/15rxhh6/program_review_dan_johns_mass_made_simple/), which I blended with his ‚ÄúEasy Strength‚Äù program as well, 9 weeks following my own [Chaos is the Plan]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/15obkuc/chaos_is_the_plan_the_plana_3_sentence_training/) protocol for 9 weeks while pretending I was a Cimmerian, Jamie Lewis‚Äô [Juggeryoke]( https://old.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/16ui88l/jamie_lewis_juggeryoke_program_review/), Dante Trudel‚Äôs [DoggCrapp]( https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1ch1o6m/program_discussion_8_week_doggcrapp_check_in/), and various other distractions along the way.


* I also competed in a strongman competition while my weight was completely free falling, which went [poorly]( https://old.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/16xxept/meet_report_strength_games_v_how_to_come_in_dead/) and a grappling competition which [I won](https://old.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/18aqq9e/i_took_first_place_in_a_submission_grappling/) despite having not actually grappled in 18 years‚Ä¶so that was cool.  Oh yeah, I also did a [10 mile race with no training](https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1bz36yu/ran_a_10_mile_race_on_saturday_off_the_best_fuel/), which was another not smart thing I did.

* I also went on a few cruises throughout the duration of my weight loss and weight gain, 2 of which I made it a personal mission to gorge myself in as much carnivore food as possible, the most recent one (over my kid‚Äôs spring break) resulting in me consuming [102 eggs and 54 steaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1bi0yla/took_down_102_eggs_and_54_steaks_over_7_days_on_a/) in 7 days, alongside multiple [triple entr√©e dinners](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/8/b/4/8b4467a0b55348e5a3552a764b86b98e2a7d1869.jpeg) and other [delicious foods](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/9/a/a/9aae99db80db18520589694341536d4193c54b49.jpeg).  I do firmly believe those cruises were pretty effective for my goal of gaining, as 1 week of full scale feasting and minimal training really had me in an anabolic way.


**LESSONS LEARNED**

* Fat Loss is a vacation.  I‚Äôve said that multiple times.  Gaining is the HARD part: fat loss is the BREAK was get FROM gaining.  To get at that initial 201lbs, I effectively broke myself from the training and the eating.  I had to get healthy before I could gain again.  And in the process of getting healthy, I got STUPIDLY lean.  And it was incredibly easy.  I never struggled with hunger, low energy, etc: I just kept eating and training and letting the weight fall off of me.  I was also able to basically train anyway I wanted to during those phases (which is why I did that Viking/Cimmerian stuff), because the only real function of resistance training while losing fat is to maintain muscle, and it requires FAR less effort to maintain muscle than to build it.  This is why folks should NOT worry about ‚Äúoverbulking‚Äù: it just means you get to spend even MORE time relaxing from the VERY hard effort you put into gaining.


* On the above, starting out from such a lean state gave me a TON of runway as far as gaining goes.  THIS is the secret to ‚Äúlean gaining‚Äù.  It‚Äôs not about operating on the tiniest of caloric surplus margins to ensure you gain only muscle and no fat: it‚Äôs about starting off in such a physically primed state to grow that, even when you DO put on fat, you go from ‚Äúpeeled to lean‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúfrom tubby to obese‚Äù.  Dan John wrote about this in ‚ÄúMass Made Simple‚Äù, and experiencing it first hand was pretty eye opening.  Which, once again, is WHY we have phases of gaining and losing, rather than just always trying to be in a state of gaining by trying to cheat the system with tiny calorie surpluses.  And on that note‚Ä¶      


 * Everything operates in cycles.  There is the bulking and gaining cycle, but even then that can be truncated into the Famine and Feast cycles I was employing (2 weeks Famine, 4 weeks Feast was standard for me).  And even then, throughout the week itself, I‚Äôd cycle my nutrition: having some days that were pure Protein Sparing Modified Fasting, some that had midday meals and end of day meals, some that were just one meal a day, some that were 3 meals, etc.  Trying to keep things controlled and uniform all the time just promotes stagnation: things need to be kept fresh and a little chaotic.  And my training was the same way: you see the various programs I ran over this time, rather than just sticking with one way indefinitely.  There was a time and a place for all of these programs, and some were there when I was ready to really push the petal to the metal, and others were there when I needed to back off a bit and prioritize something else.


* When my weight was dropping, I changed up how I DID my exercises.  At my heaviest, I used a [low bar squat technique]( https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/1155rtv/20x400lb_breathing_squat_huge_milestone_pr_on/), which was something I‚Äôd been using since the very first day I squatted.  While my bodyweight was falling, I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to match my previous performance on it, and rather than let that get in my head, I completely changed [how I squat](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/18mutp5/77_seventysevenx185lb_buffalo_bar_squats/), using a high bar, very close stance, and hitting as full of a depth as I possibly could.  I specifically used Mass Made Simple to break in this style, since Dan has you start off squatting 95lbs, and this gave me an opportunity to effectively relearn the movement from scratch and not concern myself with how much I was moving.  I also started squatting beltless for the first time‚Ä¶ever, and removed the belt from the majority of my training as well for similar reasons: it gave me a whole new paradigm to operate off of.  And now I‚Äôve been using that in my gaining phase, and in doing so I‚Äôm bringing up weaknesses that were holding me back previously and growing/emphasizing new muscles.  My quads are responding well from all the deep squatting.      


* I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äô NEARLY as much food as I thought I did.  This was a boon as a gainer.  When I dropped all of the weight, I was eating until satiety, and since I had radically shifted my diet so much, I reached satiety much sooner than I previously did.  This meant consuming far fewer calories than I ever did before‚Ä¶yet I felt and performed fine in training.  I wasn‚Äôt dragging, I wasn‚Äôt in a zombie state, I wasn‚Äôt starving, and I was looking pretty awesome along the way.  And when it came time to gain, I didn‚Äôt need to be NEARLY as aggressive as I was in previous endeavors: I could eat slightly beyond satiety or add in some more calorically dense foods and be more than squared away.

First 3 pics are current. Last one is last year.

Did my own version of GZCL.

Bench went from 125lbs to 225lbs.

Cant remember where I started with squat but I can do 270lbs rn.

Deadlift went from like 165(I really can‚Äôt remember) to 350(proly lower now cus I haven‚Äôt deadlifted in month due to back pain).

Shoulder press went from 70lbs to 140lbs.

Diet: I only drink water 95% of the time and the other 5% I drink a protein shake or milk. I try to avoid sugar. If I eat junk food I try to make sure it at least has a fair amount of protein (like a McDouble). Nothing too crazy.",2024-07-02 01:16:06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dt9kub
1d0fotv,gainit,What am I doing wrong? ,"I am 6 ft currently 173.2lbs.

Between like January and March I lost like 18lbs.. went from 189 to 171lbs. I never ate, diet was pretty much non existent, depression I guess. But I never had any muscle so a lot of it was fat I became even skinner and I figured nows the best time to actually build up on the empty frame. 

I started eating healthy (literally no junk food at all) a little over a month ago along with some body weight exercises. A week later I started going to a gym and using my fitness pal following even more strict dieting macros and eating a minimum of 3000 calories a day. So about a month total for diet and a little over 3 weeks for the gym. 

I feel like I'm making progress visibly, I actually have abs that I can feel (it used to be literally flat) which I noticed after the first week, but honestly my weight is discouraging me. I was excited when I saw over 177 a few days ago but I just weighed myself and I'm at 173.2 currently. 

Should I maybe up my intake to 3500 calories? I go to the gym 6 days a week and alternate top and bottom (because I truthfully am not experienced enough to try anything else specialized). I take Saturday off.

18dqkqt,gainit,Fantastic Video by Mike Israetel on Clean vs Dirty Bulking,"To start, [here is the video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHD-lsh5efQ)

Some great things that Mike covers here.

* A clean bulk means a bulk where you eat CLEAN food.  A dirty bulk is a bulk where you eat DIRTY food.

* No, a clean bulk is NOT a bulk where you gain minimal fat.  That‚Äôs a LEAN bulk.  A dirty bulk is NOT a bulk where you put on more fat than necessary.  It‚Äôs about WHAT you are eating.  Because that actually makes sense.

* He takes the time to give a solid definition of what is junk food: contains high amounts of sugar, salt, saturated fats, and is hyper-palatable.  It doesn‚Äôt always have all 3 of those things, but it is always hyper-palatable.  This is a solid guideline for those gainers struggling to understand food.

* He discusses the pros and cons to each.  

* In the clean bulk portion, he specifically discusses the benefits associated with eating high quality foods vs trying to get your nutrition from oreos and protein powder.  I know many gainers are still all aboard the ‚ÄúIf It Fits Your Macros‚Äù train, but those that are actually succeeding out there understand that food quality matters.  It allows you to train more effectively, which helps vector that surplus more toward muscular gain than fat, and keeps you healthier, which is going to mean less downtime due to illness/injury/etc.

* In the dirty bulk portion, he talks about how hyper-palatable food is great for plateau breaking (just like Dave Tate‚Äôs experience with JM Blakely‚Äôs diet), overcoming diet/mental fatigue, and simply ‚Äúmoving the needle‚Äù on gaining.

* Toward the end, he goes on to describe how there‚Äôs no dichotomy: you don‚Äôt have to choose specifically ONE approach.  You can blend as needed, understanding that the food is ultimately a tool.


For those unfamiliar with Mike‚Äôs style, he does tend to go off on weird side tangents and bizarre jokes, but the signal-to-noise ratio on this is solid enough that it‚Äôs worth it for any gainers interested in succeeding at this endeavor.",2023-12-08 16:29:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/18dqkqt/fantastic_video_by_mike_israetel_on_clean_vs/
183vlvn,gainit,[M/36/1.8m] How long until I start seeing results from my bulking?,"Hey bros!

  
I'm very new to lifting, only started last year but I was yoyo dieting the whole time so I didn't make too much progress, but I started bulking since exactly 30 days ago, and I don't see too much difference in the mirror, only a little bit more ""belly size"".

  
I'm lifting 4 times a week, and I think I really do push myself (I almost blacked out doing biceps curls the other day in the last rep), my train is split into: Arms and shoulders, chest and shoulders, legs and back, I do around 6 exercises each session and it takes me around 80min to finish it.

  
I also train olympic diving for the other 3 days of the week, totaling 4 hours of training per week. I also do lots of biking, since I live in the Netherlands.

  
I track everything I eat, these are my macros averages for the past 30 days:

  
Calories: 3156 kcal; Protein: 214g; Carbs: 350 g; Fat: 100g

  
3150 calories is a lot of food for me, since I also work 8h a day and have other hobbies (like videogames, etc), sometimes is later at night and I still need to eat 1000 calories to reach my goal, so I ended up chugging some whey protein and some chocolate or other ""dirty"" food to get there, so my question is, can having around 30% of junk food in my diet tank my progress?

  
I've put on 2kg, is that too much or too little? Should I wait more to start seeing results, or just I try to tweak something?

13e0250,gainit,"[Progress] M/28/6'4"": 160lbs-193lbs; 1-Year","A little over a year ago I went to play tennis and had zero energy to the point I thought I was going to pass out in the first 10 minutes of playing. I started tracking calories and realized I was undereating for awhile. From that point on I vowed to never feel like that again. I had always been skinny my entire life (was 140 lbs when I graduated hs) and last year I finally decided to commit to consistently lift and gain muscle.  Basically from elementary school to my early twenties I always got made fun of for being so skinny and I honestly thought there was nothing I could do about it. I've always had this poor body image when I looked in the mirror, but now I love how I look and if I ever see my reflection I'm always flexing.

[Progress Photos](https://imgur.com/a/7YX4cQU)

**Program**

Started off trying to run WS4SB in my garage and quickly realized that I should start with something else. I'd categorize myself as a beginner but also someone who didn't know what they were doing, so I changed from WS4SB to PPL in the first 2 weeks after I started but added some 5x5 for compound lifts. I don't feel like I maximized hypertrophy very much this year as my focus was very much on strength and thinking lifting for strength would equate to massive size. I started modifying PPL for things I didn't have in my home gym and then I just focused on lifting heavy weights for 5-6 reps most of my workouts this year. In hindsight I'd probably add more hypertrophy workouts as apposed to strength only workouts. I will say this is the strongest I've ever been!

**Diet**

I didn't really have a dedicated diet in the first 4-5 months (went from 160-187 lbs in that time span). I focused on drinking whole milk, whey protein, and literally anything else I could eat. It was pretty hard in the beginning but I ate in between 2900-3300 calories. In that span I would eat peanut butter sandwiches, oreos, chips, peanuts, and basically anything even if it was unhealthy to meet my desired calorie intake. I noticed it in my gut and based on how quickly I was gaining I thought I should cut back a bit.

From about August-December I slowed my bulk and dropped to about 184-185 lbs. I found Huel Black and started drinking that as a meal replacement for unhealthy foods then started to bulk again only this time more slowly than in the months prior. My priority has been to focus less on calories and more on getting more protein, I've been aiming to get at least 160-180g of protein a day. Primarily from meats like chicken, steak, salmon. I've noticed focusing more on protein has lead to me still meeting my calorie goals but in a much healthier way because I'm not eating as much junk food. From the start of the new year to now I've gone from 185 to 193, feel good and being the strongest I've ever been. When I look in the mirror I actually love the way I look which I've never felt that way before. What's crazy is that I've never been able to incrementally increase weights on lifts every week or even every 2 weeks in the past when I've tried to lift. But eating more has made me feel like I'm taking steroids cause I'm able to consistently lift more every week! Another side note, doing sports in hs I always felt rundown and exhausted. I've been still staying active in sports along with lifting and I definitely don't have that rundown feeling now that I'm eating a calorie surplus.

**Lifts**

Bench: 135 (3 RPM)

Squat: 270 (3 RPM)

Deadlift: 150 (Stopped early on because of form)

Most I've ever lifted in my life before this: Bench - 75 on 10 reps and Squat - 205 on 10 reps!

I really want to get a fuller chest so if anybody has any tips to help I would appreciate it. Also the bottom of my ribcage still sticks out and if anybody has any idea on that one I would also greatly appreciate it. My goal is to focus on hypertrophy for the next 6 months and see if I can get to 205 lbs before I start to cut. I'm very excited and looking forward to the future. I'm planning on doing PHUL or PHAT, but if anyone has any hypertrophy program that I should try lmk!

Honestly I'm so grateful for this sub! I look at it everyday for any silly beginner questions I have or just getting motivated by someone's recent progress post. This sub has given me the confidence to actually join a gym and wear tank tops in public, both things I'd never thought I'd do!",2023-05-10 19:05:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/13e0250/progress_m2864_160lbs193lbs_1year/

I started working on it around July but didn't go that often after until I went to Uni last September. From them, I trained 6 days a week following my own custom PPL routine. I was really consistent in getting around 180g of protein a day however I didn't really track my calories I just ate more protein in general and reduced junk food and unhealthy snacks. I was really happy with my progress until November when I got sick and injured and was out for a good 3 weeks and I wasn't able to consistently work out at all during that month.  In December I barely went to the gym but I restarted in January, so technically my progress is really more like 3 months which to me is surprising and I never knew I could gain this muscle within a short period. I have decided to take my bulk more seriously and eat more and I am excited to see my progress in the coming months. Let me  know what you think about my progress

Say you eat 3,000 calories a day for a nice small surplus. You get the right mix of protein, fats and carbs. And you do it ALL with HEALTHY FOOD ONLY. This bulk is giving you nice gains. 


What if instead, you had eaten the same amount of calories (3,000), eaten the same EXACT macros, BUT, it was with junk food?

Would you gain more fat in the second example, even though the caloric intake and the macros were the EXACT same? I understand that you would obviously FEEL worse with the second diet. I‚Äôm just interested in if it would cause you to gain more fat.

Much more energy than my dirty bulks of the past and much better results.

Im thinking of returning to training but my clean bulk diet is a lot of whole foods and it will be a lot of effort to get the extra 650 in id need to compensate for the calories burned from training. 

My question is if i ate high calorie junk food a few hours before training would that be burnt off from cardio as opposed to my healthy calories that i would consume after training for muscle growth?

I know this sounds like stupid question and might have been answered before but muay thai coaches claim just train and just simply eat more which has never been good advice for me while advice for gaining weight implies focus less on cardio and either follows dirty bulk or clean bulk ideaolgy.

Wendy's: 4 for $4 - I get a water, so around 800-850 calories. Junk food, but a solid block of inexpensive, convenient, tasty calories. It‚Äôs a weird amount of food where it‚Äôs too big to be a snack, but too small to be a meal

Chipotle: anything - wholesome, protein filled, decently priced meal with solid portion sizes every time

Mcdonalds: Big Mac and 10 nugs- around $6 **after tax** using the deal in the mobile app. Only just over 1000 calories, but boy does it taste good. It's like a bigger, tastier, maybe unhealthier version of the 4 for $4 deal.

Bonus

Chinese food: That one menu option that gets you a fuckton of food for the low. At the place I used to go to, it was beef and lo mien. You got, what I affectionately called a trough of 2/3rds noodles and 1/3rd strips of beef for like $10. Even at peak bulk, it'd often take me two sittings to eat an order of beef and lo mien from this place.

z950el,gainit,"How to eat 3,000 calories in 6 minutes.","Hello,

[Last night I ate 3,000+ calories in 6 minutes (and 1 second)](https://youtu.be/pvuv4wZion4?t=813) and I just wanted to give everyone a few notes about it. I'm not here to ""brag"" or show off. Just a giving a few tidbits with an extreme scenario. (Video is timestamped to the right part, but feel free to watch the whole thing!)

1. It was not enjoyable. My mission was to eat as quickly as possible. Not to enjoy myself. There are going to be times when you don't enjoy eating. Maybe every single time you eat. Your feelings don't matter if you want the results more than the alternative. I wanted to win. I suffered through because I rather win than lose.
2. I had to eat while I was full. There are going to be times that you are full and you still have to continue eating. Being full isn't a deciding factor in gaining. If it worked that way chances are you wouldn't be here. Eating while being full isn't enjoyable. See #1.
3. My jaw hurt the entire time. I get it, you guys aren't use to eating normal amounts of food. I can relate to how hard it was to literally chew the food and force it down. It's a muscle. It will get tired. The more you practice the easier it will get. Don't quit when things get hard, push through. It doesn't feel good. See #1.
4. I didn't get fat. In fact, my weight didn't change at all from yesterday morning to this morning. One day of weird eating isn't going to make a difference in the long run. Don't be scared to overeat, especially in the scenario where you need to gain weight!
5. I'm not unhealthy. Yep I ate pizza, wow junk food right? Did my health decline indulging once in a while? No. Don't worry about it. In fact, what makes it unhealthy? The bread? The cheese? The meat? The vegetables? The oil? Compared to drinking a shot of olive oil? The sodium maybe, but again I don't eat like this everyday. I get plenty of exercise, I get plenty of water.
6. I didn't throw up. There were times that I felt like I was going to throw up, but I didn't. We can't always trust our feelings. We are sensitive creatures. See #1.

\----------

Overall, you need to do things that are uncomfortable to get the results you want. In my case, a trophy and a free months of pizza. In your case, a body that you're more comfortable in. Want to be comfortable? Get ready spending a lot of time being uncomfortable. If I can eat 3,000 calories (3+ pounds of pizza) in 6 minutes, you can eat in a calorie surplus throughout the entirety of the day. You just need to try trying.

wp4ro4,gainit,A simple cost-effective trick I use to eat more: MSG,"Monosodium glutamate, short MSG, is a type of umami flavor enhancing salt which tricks the brain to believe food is tastier than it actually is. You may have never heard of it, but many of you undoubtly ate it before. All Chinese takeaway restaurants use MSG, KFC, potato crisps, instant noodles and canned soups. It also occurs naturally in tomatoes.

I add just a dash of it to fried rice I prepare myself. A bag of 200 grams cost me ‚Ç¨1,10. Don't go overboard with it though, too much MSG is linked with headaches.

**Edit:** people making fun, saying that seasoned food tastes better therefore you'll eat more are missing the point. 

Obviously you gotta season your food. MSG is beyond just seasoning your food. Many people aren't aware of what exactly makes them crave junk food and why it's easy to overeat them. MSG is a big reason why and leveraging it in your own healthy cooking can help you increase your appetite.

It's a flavor *ENHANCER* for the seasoning and the natural taste of the ingredients you already use.",2022-08-15 16:59:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/wp4ro4/a_simple_costeffective_trick_i_use_to_eat_more_msg/
vvynut,gainit,I (18F) have a BMI of 15.9. I am extremely weak and need to gain strength for an upcoming trip next month.,"I am 170cm and 46kg (5‚Äô7 and 102.5lbs) on an EXTREMELY good day. I‚Äôve been eating a lot for the last few weeks, but I am usually around 44 - 45kg (97-99lbs) no matter what I do. I never used a scale before this year, and always thought I was around 120 or 130 lbs, so when I was weighed at the doctors for the first time, I was extremely shocked. I also think I lost weight out of stress of school, and forgetting to eat a lot, because relatives keep commenting on how skinny I‚Äôve gotten. 

The problem is, I need to gain weight before an upcoming hiking trip next month. I want to keep up with the rest of the group so I am not embarrassed. I get tired easily, and can barely lift a gallon of milk. I can‚Äôt do push-ups, even the easy ones, get tired going up too many stairs, and avoid carrying heavy things. But I‚Äôve been weak my entire life regardless of my weight though. 

How do I gain strength? How much weight am I supposed to gain to be strong? Should I bulk up before my trip by any
means possible while trying to workout? I usually eat a lot of snacks and junk food since I‚Äôm a picky eater. I also have heartburn, so I don‚Äôt eat too much because I hate the feeling of heartburn. I usually eat 1-2 meals a day. I never eat breakfast (bc I forget or sleep in too late). I counted my calories and I barely get above 1500, except on days when I eat out and get like 1000 calories in one meal. But I don‚Äôt have enough money to do that all the time. Im also very active, and bike/walk everywhere so I think that contributes to not being able to gain weight ??? 

Also, is calories from junk food good for gaining weight and strength? Like if I start drinking full calorie sugar drinks (I only drink 0 sugar drinks these days bc of heartburn but I could start). Is milk good for gaining weight? And how could I keep my look, because I might hate being weak but I still like how my face looks nowadays. 

TLDR: I want to gain strength within the next month for a physically gruelling camping trip. How do I gain weight/workout so I can do this? Should I try to eat any calories possible?

veeiqv,gainit,What are some healthy low fiber carbs for bulking?,Something I've noticed about myself is that I can eat a lot more calories without feeling full 24 7 when I eat junk food because it's low in fiber. I just realized for years that I was eating close to 100 grams of fiber per day. I'm not advocating to go fiber free I just find reducing my intake in half helps me eat a lot more food without feeling stuffed out of my mind on a bulk.,2022-06-17 14:31:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/veeiqv/what_are_some_healthy_low_fiber_carbs_for_bulking/
u9xnxa,gainit,Eating big takes consistent practice (long),"Just like driving a car, working on a computer, etc., eating is a skill. To have that instinctual ability to know how to eat well, eat the right amount, the right kind of food, the quantity, to be aware of how it nourishes your body, takes practice. The habit of naturally gravitating towards the right kind of food is not only sustainable, but takes a lot of practice, discipline and an acute awareness of your body. A good way to do this is to try to eat as clean as possible.

I've found that the attitude that one has towards food and eating in general, is very important. Ever since I had stopped eating outside food / junk food / processed food / foods that are unnaturally sweet / foods that are extra fatty, I have found that my relationship with food has become healthier, more intimate and more sustainable.

I rarely have to force myself to eat these days. While, in the beginning, eating the same amount of food was definitely was very hard, I had to practically force myself to sit at the table and eat like it was my job. I happened to have found a recipe that works really well for me, and one that I do not get bored of. I will have that for lunch and dinner. It consists of boiled rice, lentils, chicken breast, vegetables, all cooked in a pressure cooked with some groundnut oil, after being sauteed in onions and some 1/2 a teaspoon of Garam Masala.

I had always wanted to gain weight but didn't know how to. I realized that there was indeed a pretty simple and straightforward method for gaining. Before this, I had quite a lot of misconceptions regarding health and gaining weight in general, which I won't get into at this point. But, just to know that the simple answer was to be in a caloric surplus was great news!

I started eating big, like a maniac. There's this quote that I had read in one of the articles provided in the sidebar of this sub that goes like: ""Eat until you feel like your eyes are going to pop out of your skull, and then keep eating more"". Really, that's the only mindset that is going to work if you are wanting to gain. Feeling full is not a good enough reason to stop. You need to break those mental barriers and think about devouring like a savage monster, until your jaw starts to get sore and tired, and then keep going still. However long it might take to finish that plate, go ahead and do it. I liked to imagine someone was paying me money for each calorie I could eat.

This initial struggle will only last a few weeks until your body starts to adapt to this habit of eating, and then your stomach will to get adjusted to it as well. You will notice that eating like a monster will slowly feel more normal to you. The goal, though, is to be consistent everyday for at least 2 months with a recipe that you like and it comes up to be in a caloric surplus. After a couple of weeks, you will start to notice a change in your appetite, and you will get used to the recipe.

All of this, of course, must be done alongside with an appropriate training program. Make your body want food, the harder you train in the gym, the harder you will want food, and in this way you will create a positive feedback loop that will get stronger each time you train, eat, rest and repeat this cycle. Overtime, maintaining this habit cycle consistently will make eating easier and you will soon see that you're able to eat more with relatively less effort.

It's really the consistency, and your determination to eat even after you're full (especially in the initial stages), that will matter more than anything else.",2022-04-23 04:51:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/u9xnxa/eating_big_takes_consistent_practice_long/
tkl3od,gainit,Here is how I gained 22LB in 2 months.,"Hello, I just found this subreddit and thought maybe I could share my experiences.

I used to be skinny (150lb, 6'3) and ate a lot of food too, it just wasn't working.

One day, my friend shared a shake recipe and said it worked fine for him.

It's basic, cheap easy to obtain.

400 ml of whole milk, 150gr of baby biscuits. Baby biscuits and milk go great together and they get all mushy. You can add blueberries, banana, honey, or whatever to the mix if you feel like it.

I started drinking that every day for 10 days, and it did increase my weight 7-8lb after 2 weeks. After the first two weeks, I started to make that shake 2-4 times a week. I was measuring my weight every morning after my bathroom routine and adjusting my serving size according to my weight.

I did not want to gain 22 LB in a very short period of time, so the remaining 6 weeks were measured and controlled.

After hitting 176LB (80kg), my energy levels were better and I started to exercise too. Now, I have replaced the baby biscuits with whey protein. After working out, or if my weight is declining I start drinking a protein shake about 2 hours before bed.

Now, I'm 185LB and I went from 150 to 185 in 6 months.

If I stop consuming my protein shake my weight does go down, and If I keep making shakes every night, my weight goes above 185. Sometimes I eat oatmeal with milk before bed BUT I add whey protein to the mix. I measure my weight every day and calculate my calories according to that.

I wish you luck, and you can do it!

&#x200B;

edit: I do not eat junk food, coke, etc, rarely eat fast food, don't smoke. My body was able to handle this type of bulk without sagging or a huge belly. The size of my belly did not change. If you try my routine, please take measurements every day or so. Eating baby biscuits may not increase your weight for the first 3-4 days.

Like I was very skinny dude, used to barely eat 3 meals (around 1200 cals a day). Since I started weight training, my perspective towards food changed drastically.
I started eating 3000 cals a day. 
The vegetables I used to hate, I started loving them. 
Whenever I eat any kind of packed food, I always look at the nutrition table on that packet. 
My respect towards food has increased. I used to throw away the food which i didn't like, but now I never waste my food and try to finish it even if my stomach is full. 
Also I have completely stopped eating junk food (which i used to eat a lot earlier like noodles, burger)

tgnv5u,gainit,For skinny guys trying to bulk up (My experience putting on 20kg),"For those struggling with their weight gain (my experience)

Hey! I‚Äôm naturally a skinny guy who managed to put on a bit of size and muscle (53Kg - 73kg) For years I found myself in and out of different diet phases and training plans and found certain things worked for me and others didn‚Äôt. 

See if you‚Äôre a naturally skinny guy like me you probably struggle with not having a big appetite and rarely being able to meet your calorie goal or eat and make the foods to meet this goal. I would force myself to eat these lean meals with low calories and would have to eat high volumes of them to go into a calorie surplus. I would eat meals of chicken and rice pretty much every day, and yes I looked very lean but I was still really really small, barely filling out a size small XS! I knew I had to switch it up.

I began to stop caring about eating super healthy, and I know that sounds bad, the advice given by most is to eat as healthy as you can always. However being such a skinny guy I struggled to put weight on and the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù foods available to me, I would struggle to get down. I started finding high calorie foods that I enjoyed, that I knew I could eat a lot of and eat regularly to help me put on weight. 

In eating like this regularly I found myself gain a reasonable and decent appetite! Weight was being gained as well! Things were looking up! Being consistent with this sort of approach was great and now I can proudly say I fill out a medium size t shirt :)

I mean yes, I put on SOME body fat, but still to a low percentage (the luck of having a fast metabolism I guess) and my training was better than ever! I have since fine tuned this way of eating, eating a little cleaner whilst also maintaining a calorie surplus.

If you fancy finding out more and what foods worked best for me, I made a video about what high calorie meals I ate to put on muscle and size, (check out the YouTube link on my profile ‚ÄúClick for Gains‚Äù) let me know what you think :) Good luck with the weight gain!

I‚Äôd just like to clarify this is NOT a dirty bulk diet per say, I would never just sit and eat junk food all the time, I just mean that it‚Äôs pushed on us so much to eat super super lean with near to no fat intake that this isn‚Äôt sometimes sustainable and as a naturally skinny guy made it near impossible to put on considerable size. I focused on looking for high calorie meals that I enjoyed and knew I could sustain and eat regularly, these meals were still healthy meals I just sacrificed a little bit more fat in my diet for enjoyment - enjoyment of food being something I know myself, being a skinny guy, was rare

tfwm1k,gainit,Looking for some advices on someone who wants to lose some fat and buff up at the same time,"Hey guys.

Im 23, M, 180cm and around 75-80kg. I used to go to the gym a lot 2-3 years ago but it was very inconsistent and has since stopped. Over the years due to college and me procrastinating and drinking beer I noticed I am getting out of fitness. From the outside I guess I look like a normal tall-ish skinny dude. But I also formed a beer belly lol. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, since 2 weeks ago, I've decided to completely stop drinking beer on the weekends and cut down on junk food and started taking gym seriously. I went to gym every single day except for Sundays. At first I felt really tired and my muscles were sore af. But now I feel great and when I wake up my mind actually thinks about going to the gym! (How amazing). 

**So I guess my advice is: If I'm trying to lose my beer belly but at the same time also bulk up and look shredded, what direction should I go from here?** 

As I said, I've completely cut down on any bad food or drinks. I am drinking water constantly. Eating steamed (and then fried) chicken with rice, steamed broccoli, green beans, peppers, onions, potato etc. Sometimes I will buy from restaurants instead of cooking at home. In these cases I make sure to never eat something that is sweet or high in fat. Mostly just meat and fiber rich foods. In the mornings I will usually eat one bag of instant oatmeal with fiber cereal on top of it + 1-2 hardboiled eggs. First of all, **should I be eating a lot more? Or less? or is this fine?** I dont exactly know how to measure my home cooked meal... Its like a bowl full usually you know? Enough to make a dude eat it and sit back and relax. If I had to guess maybe at the least I am eating 1500cal, at most maybe 2000-2500 per day. 

Oh also, during my workouts I am also taking the Six Star Whey Protein (1 scoop 49g mixed with water). 

As for intermittent fasting, I dont eat anything after 8pm, and then nothing until 11am the next day. 

After going for two weeks I noticed some minor changes in my muscle tone. I feel like my biceps are much bigger, especially after workouts, and my chest in general is larger. I feel like I can lift a bit heavier or do more reps than the previous workout, which is a good sign I hope.   
Currently im alternating between upper and lower body workouts per day. 

**Upper is:** 3x chin ups (6-8 reps), 4x bent over row (10 reps), 4x bench press (10 reps), 4x bench press with dumbbell (20 reps), 4x incline bench press (15 reps), 4x overhead press dumbbell (15 reps), 3x lateral raise (10 reps), 3x tricep extension (20 reps), 3x bicep curls (16 reps), 3x cable tricep thingy (15 reps). 

&#x200B;

**Lower is:** 3x chin ups (6-8 reps), 3x barbell squat (8 reps), 3x leg press (15 reps), 3x seated leg curl (12 reps), 3x leg extension (12 reps), 3 standing calf raise (20 reps), 3 abdominal crunch machine (15 reps), 4 side planks (45 second), 3x machine crunch (18 reps)

&#x200B;

15 minute of running before workouts as well. 3 minute intense running followed by 2 minute slow and so on. And of course when at home 100 pushups and sit ups etc.

As for the workout side, I am conflicted. On one hand, one of my friend who is good at gym told me ""these are beginner exercises bro you can do much more"". And I am inclined to agree with him. However I also found these exercise list on a fitness website and they've been working well for me. I am not too tired but still also sweaty and muscles aching at the end of every workout. **Should I increase it? If so, what else should I add? Or should I just keep going like this for a few more weeks?**

&#x200B;

So thats about it for my situation guys. Never posted here before so idk what kind of answers to expect. But any answer that answers one of my questions will be massively helpful!

tebjyw,gainit,How important is glycemic index for bulking?,"Hi gainit!

So, I've recently heard that glycemic index is important to a good bulk, and that one should strive to eat a low glycemic index diet, like baked chicken, brown rice, and broccoli. Is this true? For instance, if there were two diets, identical in macros and calories, but one had much more sugar and processed foods (so, high glycemic index) relative to the other, would that count as a bad diet, or dirty bulk? Is that a bad choice? 
Assuming this high glycemic index diet isn't complete junk food and devoid of nutrients, I assumed that the only difference is how you feel. People say that high GI diets spike your insulin and change your energy levels, but just with regards to muscle building, is there any evidence (anecdotal or not) that GI matters?

t9jlq2,gainit,Is it still food?,"So at start sorry for my terrible english i hope you will survive reading through :) and so is there anyone whose look at food changed after you started working towards gaining weight ? 

When i started purposfully gaining weight, with workout and all things around it i had to force myself into making sure i was eating enough to gain weight everyday (not being hungry but still going to eat because i have to). 
So with that i started to count calories while also looking at how many fats, sacharids and protein i do eat daily. 
While also trying to eat healthy food so i could achieve that dream body i want more easily and not just become fat or have some health related problems from eating a lot of junk food.

And things are looking good, at least much better than before. But at least for me one thing changed, after doing this for a longer time period i started to look at food differently..i dont look at it as if it was ehm..food,, but just something i have to do to reach my daily caloric goal. 
For example..
Was this food something i would never touch before because i didnt really liked the taste? Yes..                       But do i need it to reach my daily calories, protein or whatever? Yes..
I am gonna eat it than.

So basically i find myself manytimes when i am outside at restaurant/fastfood or when i am thinking about what meal should i prepare, just counting calories... Not really thinking about what would i like to eat but more about what should i eat, what will give me the best proportion of proteins, fats and sacharids.",2022-03-08 15:44:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/t9jlq2/is_it_still_food/

rxnufm,gainit,Update: eating a frozen pizza at midnight for 34 consecutive days,"Hey all! This is an update to the post one month ago I forgot to make.

I've tried to gain weight before with the recommended methods, such as eating nuts or making shakes and having lots of small meals throughout the day. While it did work, it always fell apart after a while as it was too variable to consistently do. One of the shake ingredients would've ran out, or my day planning made it impossible to eat 5 times, and I never really looked forward to eating any of these extra meals.

That's when I came up with the idea to add a frozen pizza to my daily routine. Eating junk food without a second thought is the tried-and-tested method of getting fat, so I figured it would work for me as well. The idea was simple: consume a pizza at the end of every day, for 1 month straight. This post will be me sharing my experience, feel free to comment or give feedback about anything!

**Advantages**

* Extremely easy - while I'm sure that things speed up once you get in the flow of making shakes or meal prepping, nothing beats frozen pizza. It's literally throwing it in the oven, eating it and rinsing your plate. This makes it a lot easier to eat on days you don't feel like it.

* Simple logistics - No need for many different ingredients, or keeping track of when something expires. You can simply buy a stack of pizzas and store them for as long as needed.

* Quite cheap - Before this experiment I actually went through my city buying all the off-brand pizzas in every store. While some 66 cent pizzas were sweet, in the end I settled for a good tasting ‚Ç¨1 one. Price-per-calorie-wise, this seems like a good deal to me.

* Tasty - I mean, it's pizza.

**Disadvantages**

* Starts to get repetitive - Personally I don't care about this so much, but most of you probably don't want to eat the same every single day.

* Not that healthy..? - Initially I figured it is just bread with cheese and tomatoes, but reading up on some material while making this post shows me it might be a lot worse. The main reasons being LDL's and a high salt amount, however upon closer inspection my pizza doesn't seem that bad? I'll leave the specifics here so some of the more nutritionally informed gents can comment. It has 36 grams of protein though, which is a pleasant surprise.

`800kcal/26g fat (13.4g saturated)/102g carbs (16.2g sugar)/12g fibres/36g protein/2.8g salt`



**Results**

In the last 34 days, I have eaten 33 frozen pizzas (one was replaced with kebab). I went from 58.5 to 61.7 kg, a solid increase I'm very happy with! The first days I wasn't always eager to eat after dinner, but very quickly my body became accustomed to the feeling. Now I even feel the urge to eat in the evening, almost as if I've conditioned my body (is this what they call appetite?). Strangely enough there's quite some mornings in which I feel really hungry now, whereas before I would never want to eat after waking up. 

I consider this experiment a success and will definitely continue with it! However it might be a good idea to cycle between different foods throughout the days for health and taste reasons.

My gf has a thyroid condition and does not eat meat and cannot eat gluten, so I end up eating and making a lot of things that fall into that category like fake-burgers or replacing meat with a seasoned mushroom thats basically used as a burger patty. So I get enough greens, grains and beans. I eat meat occassionally and I'm not picky. I can literally eat anything. Spicy doesn't fuck with me(too bad, I think everyone gets spicy bootyhole every now and then). I can eat a ton of junk food and not gain a damn pound.

I've even went to the doctor and they just said ""your metabolism is incredibly high."" And I don't really wanna take pills to regulate that. I don't WANT to be fat but based on what I do, I SHOULD be fat. I do hair as a career so just lots of standing and talking. Playing video games, watching movies. I do get Cardio and Aerobic exercise once to several times a week as I like to walk places(I hate cars and being in them.) and ride a bicycle even if it's winter. I can move quick and climb things very well, I can pull myself up over a ledge from outstretched arms only hanging on with my hands. So I wouldn't say I'm a complete weakling but I'm not very strong either. So it's not like I DON""T ever get excercise it's just very sparse with lots of eating and chilling in between. When I was younger my workout mostly consisted of just grappling and sparring so that doesn't really build muscle or have anything to do with weight. But here I sit, a beanpole.

What do, bros?? What the fuck do I eat just to be that average 150 lbs?? What kinds of workouts should I do and what should eat to just build my weight to turn into lean muscle? Maybe even bulk up a bit to 180 if possible. I'm tired of feeling weak. I'm 28, I feel like it should be slowing down but it seems the opposite.

And I don't want to lose my agility either, being able to have a wide range of movement is very important to me.

> * For a hard gainer whose genetics are working against him, you can't just have a caloric surplus of 100 or 200 calories a day. If you're going to gain some size, you'll need a lot more... Once they reach a base point, then we put them on a balanced plan where they'll get 40 percent of their calories from carbs, 30 percent from protein, and 30 percent from fats. Hell, for some of the really skinny guys, we'll go with a 50-30-20 ratio. And these are all from higher-quality sources.-Joe DeFranco

> * Most skinny guys I know are eating junk food for the hell of it, and aren't even achieving a caloric surplus. They think they're eating a lot because they're chowing down on a lot of high-calorie junk food, but they're not using these foods as part of an overall system to get bigger. They're really just damaging their long-term health and their progress in the gym.-Craig Weller

> * I think a lot of guys are skimping on their fats, too. If your fat consumption drops below 80 grams or so a day, then your endocrine system isn't going to function as well and your testosterone production may drop off significantly.-CW

> * I think people should realize that eating a ton of calories without getting the proper vitamins, minerals, and fiber is kind of shooting yourself in the foot. Your body won't be able to assimilate all that much if you're not focused on the quality of the food‚Ä¶Let's say a client of mine is eating 3,000 calories a day, and we want him to get up to 3,600. I'm going to have him go back and examine every single meal before we do anything else. I'll have him look at the little details, like if he could be getting omega-3 eggs instead of normal ones, or if he could eat organic vegetables instead of the ones with all the pesticides. And I think once you make all those changes, then you can increase the actual calories.-Vince Delmonte

**LIFTING**

> * Guys need to find a great program, trust it, and stick to it for at least 12 weeks. Don't jump around too much. See what you learn about your body during that time and gain some leverage. When you figure out what works for your body, then you can easily tweak the next program you do. A lot of guys are jumping from one program to the next with no new knowledge about how their bodies respond to each stimulus.-VD

> * Most of the programs out there work if you train hard enough. If you're eating enough and busting your ass, then you're going to get bigger and stronger if you've got a decent plan in place... Give it a solid eight to 12 weeks and I guarantee you'll get results. ‚ÄìJD

> * In terms of frequency, three or four times a week is all they need in the gym. If you feel like you could train every day, you're probably not training correctly.-JD

> * I also don't think that a skinny guy should worry about single-joint or isolation movements if he only weighs 160 pounds. Your rhomboids or your medial deltoids just don't merit that much attention when you're that skinny.

> * A lot of kids will gain 15 to 20 pounds within a two-month period by just focusing more on their legs, especially the quads. Hell, if you want three muscle groups that will put some size on your body, it's gotta be your ass, hamstrings, and quads.-JD

**CONDITIONING**

> * That's another reason why my conditioning stuff is usually posterior-chain and lower-body dominant. Even if our equipment is nothing more than a rock on a beach, we're going to use it to stimulate as much of our bodies as we can‚Ä¶You're getting a great anabolic response because you're moving something heavy, loading the spine, and not encouraging your body to become smaller or more efficient.-CW

**OVERALL TAKEAWAYS**

> * It's definitely easier to maintain and keep growing once you've achieved your base, but it's an all-out war in the gym and the kitchen until then.-VD

> * If I could make a blanket rule, I'd have all skinny guys stop counting reps and stop following a tempo. Your greatest enemy is thinking too much. Let's eliminate that altogether and focus on training intensely to stimulate growth. I want my guy completely out of his comfort zone. Take whatever program you're following, start with weights that are five pounds heavier than you did last week, and do as many reps as possible for each set‚Ä¶The only thing I want you to track is your rest period. Use a stopwatch and keep it honest. It's okay if you don't finish the workout and end up vomiting in the washroom after 10 minutes.-VD

> * Two meals per week, I want my skinny guys to do what I call Hour of Power. This means for the duration of one hour they have to shove as much food as they can into their body without puking. I don't care what they eat ‚Äì anything goes‚Ä¶I've found this caloric influx two times per week actually helps skinny guys shock their muscles into growing. It also helps with their recovery. I recommend doing the Hour of Power on Wednesday and Sunday, or any other day you have off from lifting and can afford to be a bit sluggish for a few hours.-JD

**MY THOUGHTS**

* These are some amazing points, and many I‚Äôve tried to express before without nearly as great of eloquence.  In particular‚Ä¶
* Only needing to lift 3-4 days a week.  SO many skinny trainees want to get into the gym 6-7 days a week and lift ALL the time.  Growth happens OUTSIDE the gym, and when you REALLY push hard, you‚Äôre not going to want to come back.  Reference Super Squats, Building the Monolith, DoggCrapp, 5/3/1 BBB Beefcake and Deep Water.  
* HARD conditioning with an emphasis on the lower body.  THAT‚ÄôS what you can do with your extra days of the week.  I‚Äôve absolutely observed on a personal level the benefit of including and focusing on this.  It helps you recover faster between training, improves your conditioning so that you recover between within a workout, and it seems that it makes it damn near impossible to put on fat while gaining.

* Focus on getting in a BIG surplus as the start.  You need to break the inertia of being skinny, and a 100 calorie surplus won‚Äôt do that.  The body LIKES to stay the same.  It will FIGHT to do so.  The only way to get it to change is to give it no other choice.  If you try to nickel and dime it with 100 calories at a pop, it‚Äôll just take it on and change nothing.  You hit it with a nuke, it will have no choice but to change.

* High quality nutrition.  A big part of this is learning how to cook.  Do yourself that favor.

**CONCLUSION**

* It‚Äôs a 13 year old article and it‚Äôs still pretty damn awesome.  Hope you enjoyed.",2021-11-23 20:43:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/r0mr9s/tnations_the_cure_for_skinny_roundtable/

I‚Äôm doing a relatively clean bulk, I don‚Äôt usually eat junk food, but getting up to 3500 clean calories is becoming kind of nuisance. An expensive nuisance at that.

Im currently taking creatine and a MuscleTech NitroTech protein shake (which I hated lol), and I was thinking into switching to a mass gainer, however those bad boys are hella expensive here in my country.

My workouts per week usually look like: 2 pull days, 2 push days, 1 leg day, 1 day of CrossFit so I don‚Äôt get bored and one day of rest (sometimes I skip the rest day). And I do get very close to 8 hours of sleep per day.

1mueadr,loseit,feeling hopeless,"

So I was always a chubby kid. Even as a baby I had stronger appetite. I was not overweight as a kid I was normal weight bordering on overweight. However I went to school with Chinese and Indian girls (I‚Äôm also an Indian girl) who were very skinny and short. I was also taller than them - I‚Äôm not a tall girl I‚Äôm average (5‚Äô5) but those girls were just short. So I always felt like the big and ugly girl. And growing up in early 2000s everyone hated fat girls. I was very sensitive about my weight and would cry if anyone called me fat.

My dad was very healthy eater and our family never bought junk food. I guess this benefited me a lot since I was anyways having weight problems. Tbh I don‚Äôt know how someone can have pantry full of snacks cookies sodas chips etc and just not eat it (?). For me that will all be gone by end of the week. So I don‚Äôt really get it. But we would mostly just have brown rice not even white rice and vegetables and beans of lentils. There was no junk food or unhealthy food.

In middle school I transfer to a public school from my previous private school and am surprised to see I am not considered fat anymore or tall anymore. But now I was discriminated for being the Indian girl/ethnic minority. Anyways, I also learned to cook for myself and would come home from school hungry. I actually didn‚Äôt know to cook because I was only 12 so I would just make pasta everyday that‚Äôs All I knew how to make. Eventually I stop eating my moms food and eating pasta a lot. 

Btw I also have pcos and endocrine disorder which causes weight gain, fat storage and carb cravings (which is why I would eat so much pasta). Anyways. Now I started gaining weight. I was 120 lbs at age 12 then got to 150 by the time I‚Äôm 14. When I‚Äôm 15 I got to 170. When I‚Äôm 16 I got to 190. Here is where my eating disorder started. I would starve myself some days or gain it back sometimes. I got to 180. Then my weight fluctuates from 180-200 my end of high school.

In university same thing where sometimes I have eating disorder I fluctuate between 190-210, sometimes if even reached 215. Now I‚Äôm 25 and reached my highest ever which is 220. 

Tbh I feel hopeless. Idk what to do about all this weight. I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll never stop and I will reach 250+ lbs maybe even 300 lbs at some point. I‚Äôm tired of all the judgements from society and scared to leave my house since I was a teenager because I feel uncomfortable out in the public because of my weight & how society treats fat people. I never had a boyfriend before. Idk how to lose the weight or if I ever will. It sucks that weight I gained 10 years ago is still on my body now and will never go away unless I do some extreme dieting which feels near impossible to keep up long term. 60 lbs to lose is no joke.

1muc9a0,loseit,I feel sad that losing weight was this easy all along,"I've been struggling with my weight since my teen years. I can recall being 15 and being stressed about how big I was getting. I would try so many things to lose weight. I would do HIIT workouts for hours, restrict my food (and then go into binge mode few days later) and spend all day obsessing over how bad I look. 

Now at 22, I've lost 9kgs in 3 months. My highest weight was 75 kg and it's currently 66 kg. Losing all of this weight didn't even require considerable effort. I added walking (minimum 10k steps), cut out junk food (ice creams, crisps, biscuits, soda) and ate smaller portions. That's pretty much it. It's insane how easy it was. 

I'm having mixed emotions about my weight loss. I struggled for years to lose all of this weight and destroyed my self esteem and mental health. It would have been nice if teen me had the guidance and knowledge I have now :"") 

Edit: I didn't mean for this post to come off as me bragging about losing weight. I apologise for that. I think a better way to put it is that it is easy when you simplify weight loss and build habits that aid you in your journey.

1mu1ckp,loseit,just wanted to share my experience!,"So I‚Äôve always wanted to lose a good amount of weight. Right after i graduated high school i gained about 30lbs. For reference I‚Äôm 4‚Äô10 and my heaviest was 190, and right now I‚Äôm 152. I‚Äôm choosing to share this here because I have so much shame with how much I‚Äôve struggled with this, but it‚Äôs honestly something I‚Äôm excited and proud about.

I‚Äôve struggled a lot, it always seemed like the only time I would ever lose weight and keep it off was when I would have a spell of just starving myself, lose a good 10lbs then gain 5 back and keep losing/gaining that same 5. Last summer I got my heart broke and lost 20lbs. Since then though I‚Äôve noticed my tolerance for eating huge amounts of food has completely disappeared. I‚Äôve managed to keep it off somehow by eating (admittedly junk food) once a day but was always stuck between 158-156. 

For the last month I‚Äôve really tracked my calories, I try to make sure my meals are relatively planned out. At my height I can only have 1500 cals to lose around 1lb a week. Honestly it‚Äôs WORKING. I definitely have had some faults about once a week where I just can‚Äôt manage to keep myself out of the fridge and just eat whatever I can find, but I decide against tracking those calories because I know if I see it on paper it‚Äôll make me feel some type of way, after those days I‚Äôll also keep from weighing myself for a day or two. 

I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs been hard, I have a tendency to eat more when my days aren‚Äôt scheduled out well or I have a day off because I work night shift so sometimes I mess up my sleep schedule and will be up all day and night. So, instead of giving up I‚Äôve used it sort of as an excuse to just work almost every day (i need to anyway, im trying to save up about $20,000 in the next year and a half). 

With keeping my eating under a full control, I feel so much better. I feel more in control of everything else in my life. I feel more productive, I have less days where I‚Äôm unhappy with myself, and most importantly, less days where I‚Äôm getting discouraged from my other VERY important goals in my life. 

Overall, finding out how to control my eating has literally saved my life and my mental health in so so so many ways.",2025-08-18 22:55:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mu1ckp/just_wanted_to_share_my_experience/
1mt2pks,loseit,Blue collar worker unsure where to start.,"I used to be fit. Like very fit. I walked 4 miles up and down a mountain to work. I was out every day. I was suffering from anxiety and this was how I self-medicated. 

I've since found myself out of the mountains to get a full time job as an electrical apprentice. 8 months of the year I'm both in class and working 40 hours a week. The rest of the year I work 40+ hours. At work I walk at minimum *20000 steps a day along with physical labor. I'm very active at work.

I've since gone on anxiety medication and I no longer HAVE to get in a huge workout to keep myself sane. So I haven't been. I've been eating ok but I indulge in sweets and junk food a lot more than I should. I try to steer in the right direction using MyFitnessPal but I go in and out of that.

I'm now completely out of shape. I keep trying to get started on a good workout routine and diet. I've had a couple instances where I started to see physical progress but I'll have a difficult project at work or class will get to be too much and fall out of it.

I also see myself holding back in the gym because I don't want to feel spent at work the next day.

Any blue collar workers out there with advice on how to stay fit in the trades? What do your meals look like? How often do you work out and what are your workouts like? I'd really like to be strong and confident like I used to be but I honestly don't know where to start.

1mrhx1s,loseit,"It took me 6 weeks to START losing weight. Also, Metamucil works.","I've been trying to lose weight for the past year, but I never realized how long it can take to properly train your body/appetite to get used to the caloric deficit.

I started at 70.2kg in mid-June, and I was diligently counting calories - but after 4 weeks, the scale barely moved. I kept hovering between 69kg and 69.9kg for about a month. It was frustrating. I didn't know what I was doing wrong. I was drinking 2L water a day, zero alcohol, removed junk food from my life. I was trying very hard to stay within my deficit.

When I look back on my food logs, I probably stayed within my deficit 4-5 days out of the week. So during Week 5-6, I noticed that I wasn't pooping daily - so I added Metamucil to my diet.

Once I started taking Metamucil (psyllium husk), my weight was dropping like crazy. I'm down 3kg in 4 weeks. My body feels lighter, it feels easier to listen to my hunger cues, and I never knew that not pooping daily could affect my health so significantly.

Consequently, Metamucil seemed to also help me stay within my calorie deficit every day - it felt like less of a struggle to eat less.

Lesson learned: it takes time to recalibrate your body and understand what it needs or how it functions. But I am just ECSTATIC I finally figured out how to lose weight. It DOES take time to figure out. For anyone out there who is struggling with starting to lose weight - be kind to yourself as it can be a learning curve to get the body going.

1mpiil2,loseit,Health Journey,"Hi everyone,

So I already lost a lot of weight. I used to weigh 135kg, and now I‚Äôm 93kg (I‚Äôm tall btw). I‚Äôm very proud overall about my weight, but I did it very unconventionally. 

I didn‚Äôt change my diet at all, (with the exception of avoiding sweets and sugary drinks) I just watched the calories. Unfortunately for me though, my diet was just Italian food, steaks, and junk food. I ate chicken wings almost on a daily basis, and as you can probably guess, it wasn‚Äôt very healthy.

Now I decided to start eating healthier, but it‚Äôs been difficult. Last week, I tried my first salad. And today, I tried my first Greek yogurt. Although I did get used to the salads, I can‚Äôt say the same about the yogurt. I only eat yogurt with a tablespoon of honey and a lot of berries, which I don‚Äôt know if it negates the purpose in the first place, but my idea is to gradually reduce them until I get used to the taste.

I‚Äôm hoping I develop a healthier palate in the future, and try to make healthy food a little less boring.

1mmqjcl,loseit,"Be honest, how badly did I screw up the last two weeks?","*Unfortunately, something happened to me that probably happens to many people at some point. I somehow fell of the wagon and spent almost two weeks eating unhealthily.*

**Here's some brief information:**  
**I am male, 30 years old, about 1.74 m tall, and currently weigh (once again) 96.5 kg (214,9 lbs).**

I started in mid-June at 102.6 kg (226,2 lbs) and then lost weight to 93.8 kg (206,8 lbs) by July 28, 2025.  
So I lost just under 9 kg (\~20 lbs). However, 3-4 kg (6-8 lbs) of that was probably water retention due to glycogen and the high-salt diet I had been on before.  
I was on vacation from July 29, 2025, and somehow I thought to myself, ‚Äú*Ah, I'll treat myself to something unhealthy now, I've achieved quite a lot so far...*‚Äù

That was two weeks ago, and the inevitable happened...  
One day turned into almost two weeks of continuous unhealthy eating.  
I have no idea how that could have happened. Sure, it was my decision, but after 2-3 days, I had such extreme cravings for junk food and sweets day after day.

Anyway... today I weigh 96.5 kg (214,9 lbs) again. That's 2.7 kg (5,9 lbs) more than two weeks ago.  
How bad is it really? How much of it is just weight from glycogen or the water that is bound to it and from the salty diet? How much of that do you think is actually fat that has been regained?  
I was in calorie surplus for at least 8-10 days during those two weeks. Maybe not extremely, but definitely around 1000 or even 1500 calories surplus every day. Unfortunately, it was also a very carbs-rich diet.

I plan to start again tomorrow, even though it's hard, but I don't want to completely screw up and end up weighing over 100 kg again. Two lost weeks are enough.

  
**EDIT:**



**Ok guys I actually spent the last 30 minutes calculating...**

**I keep a diary in which I write down what I eat every day. I have now added up the TOTAL calories. That was pretty much exactly 35,500 calories that I ate in those two unhealthy weeks.**  
**I also know what I did on those days. In total, I burned about 32,000 calories in those two weeks (TDEE for the entire two weeks; I also had two intense days of exercise during those two days).**

**That makes for a surplus of 3,500 calories.**  
**Converted into calories, assuming that 1 kg of fat is 7,700 calories, I gained about 450 grams of fat.**  
**If you factor in a few calculation errors, that might be 500-550 grams of fat.**

**So I'm relatively reassured.**

1mmpehj,loseit,"After losing 60lbs in 14 months, here are 5 things I wish I knew when I started.","Hey ya'll, this sub is such an encouraging place, so I figured I'd drop the lessons I've learned along the way, and hope I can inspire atleast one person with this post!

When I started, I wasn‚Äôt athletic at all. I thought running a mile was impossible. Losing the weight changed everything. It showed me that if you stick to the basics and stay consistent, you can do anything you set your mind to. I‚Äôve now run 2 marathons because of that lesson alone.

Here are 5 things I wish I knew from day one:

1. **Don‚Äôt try to go from A to C:** Most people start following someone‚Äôs ‚Äúfinal form‚Äù routine or diet. If you‚Äôre trying to go from A to B, you don‚Äôt need the strictest diet on earth. You need to master the basics first.
2. **Any diet works if you can stick to it:** Low carb, keto, intermittent fasting‚Ä¶ they can all work, but only if you can actually live with them long term. Pick something you can see yourself doing a year from now.
3. **Progress isn‚Äôt always visible:** The scale will stall, your body will look the same some weeks, but inside your habits are improving. Those ‚Äúinvisible wins‚Äù matter more than you think.
4. **Your environment matters:** If your kitchen is full of junk food, your willpower won‚Äôt save you forever. Set yourself up to win by making the easy choice the right choice.
5. **Start smaller than you think:** Don‚Äôt try to run every day or cut all sugar at once. Start with one daily walk, one healthier meal, or tracking your food. Small wins snowball into massive change.

If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôre stuck, please remember that you're so strong for already putting in the work, and progress takes time!

1mmjdrb,loseit,Do you adjust your caloric intake based on activity?  I never did but I am a lot more active now and am starving all the time. I have a new very busy 3-11:30 job where I get a lot of steps and am awake longer and eat more meals.,"ETA: was doing 1200 calories while losing weight - went up to 1500 before starting new job. Not working through because I am always hungry and when ppl bring junk food to work there have a few occasions where I have eaten it where it wouldn't have even tempted me before. Just calculated my TDEE and it says my maintenance calories are 2,554 ‚ÄºÔ∏è No wonder I am hungry. 

Do you increase your calories based on exercise? In the past I haven't but am a lot more active now and sooo starving working 3-11:30

Do you increase your calorie intake based on your exercise?  I never did but now that I doing 20,000-30,000 steps I‚Äôm starving

Historically I never adjusted my calories for exercise - 30 minute walk or 45 min of lifting. I increased to (2) 7,500 walks per day so 15,000 was typical on the days I walked twice. 

I just started a hospital job and can get up to 20,000 steps on my 8 hours shift. I had to cut one of my 7,500 walks just because I am not home. My average steps are usually 20,000 to 25,000  I am starving all the time. I try to increase protein and fiber and drink more water. What works for you?

My new shift is 3-11:30 and I feel like I eat 6 meals a day. I'm up by 6-7, have breakfast, a snack and lunch before work. Dinner at work is at 6:00 and break is at 9:00. By both times I am starving. I get home at midnight and am hungry and want to eat again which I no is a no no but I can't sleep if I am so hungry. 

I recently lost 96 pounds and am having a hard time maintaining with this new schedule. I know I need more calories but I need to be strategic about it.

I need to get back into lifting and body weight exercises to build up muscle (I think I lost muscle mass when losing weight) and also to burn more calories at rest. 

Thanks for any advice. ",2025-08-10 14:02:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mmjdrb/do_you_adjust_your_caloric_intake_based_on/
1ml0di4,loseit,Starting my journey- am I on the right track?,"Hello everyone. I just joined today, and am on day three of my weight loss journey. I did most of my decision making by researching online and, occasionally, asking a friend. I am a 5'11"", 280~ Male (my scale hasn't come in yet). Using a calorie deficit calculator, I set a goal of 2000 calories a day. The past three days, I've taken 20ish minutes walks, at various intensities. After, I come home and do some jumping jacks, squats and planks. My diet consists of a nutrition shake in the morning with a kind bar and a multivitamin, and prep meals through CookUnity for lunch and dinner (I have a busy schedule, they are convenient and not processed). Other than a diet soda a day so far, I've cut all soda and junk food. My goal weight is an arbitrary 200 pounds. Should I be worrying about anything else? Do I need to adjust anything?

1mkq6wn,loseit,how do y'all balance it all?,"i really want to and need to lose weight - i live a pretty unhealthy lifestyle now and i need to change not only for aesthetics (tho i wanna be skinny to be prettier as well) but also just overall health reasons. and i know my short comings so not just a discipline standpoint but a genuine question how do you balance it all - nutrition, social life, sleep, fitness, etc.?

i am trying to make a meal plan bc i know that if i dont plan my meals i tend to skip meals and then overeat on junk food and generally make poor food decisions which are calorically dense and unhealthy. but alone planning the meals is so much effort - it has to be low enough calorie for a deficit bc its the only way to lose weight (i know) - i cant really count calories bc its not healthy for me and a slippery slope into old habits, but not only do those meals have to calorically okay but also balanced on macros including high protein, high fiber, healthy fats (and maybe carbs) and micronutrients from fruit and vegetables. i am vegan for environmental and ethical reasons so that makes it even harder.

so planning meals that are macro balanced, vegan, have fiber and also taste decent enough (bc if they are not at least somewhat tasty i will binge). i will binge if they arent balanced enough. i will binge if they are just macros no taste. i will binge if i do intermittent fasting - i can fast thats not the problem, the problem is not binging after fasting, and i know from experience regular, balanced smaller meals help with my binging urges instead of omad or 2 bigger meals.

i know meal prep is a great tool and i am down for doing it - i just have a hard time from the logistical standpoint, my kitchen is tiny as well as my fridge so prepping a lot and storing it is v much a struggle. if i prepped meals for the whole week on sunday i think some textural issues would occur maybe - i have had that experience. i thought about prepping breakfast for the whole week and just making 2 portions of dinner and taking one for lunch the next day - which i think is the most realistic thing for me in terms of storage. the time after work is limited tho so quick meals but that part would be fine.

i also have to say sometimes i would realistically and lets be honest i need to be realistic and honest and cant just say that i will adhere to some perfect plan bc that will never work - realistically my friends will ask me out after work to do smth then my perfect dinner cooking and lunch plan falls away and i would have to improvise for lunch which could easily end in some junk food option. while you might say just plan only social events on weekends - my friends have very different work schedules so sometimes the only time would be during the week and i cant sacrifice my social life so much bc i need it to stay sane and keep of the depression (which could lead to more binging). on top of that i am a people pleaser to saying no is not a strength of mine.

and then how do you fit in sleep. if i wanna go to the gym 4x per week for 45 min which is realisitc for results i would have to go before work - my work starts at 8 am the gym opens at 6 am. nearly all gyms in my area do that. i also know i can realistically wake up long term before 5 am bc i will not get to bed early enough to get enough sleep and we all know how important sleep is for weight loss and health. so i calculated - waking up at 5 am, packing for the gym and day and getting ready, walking to the gym (20 min) to be there at 6 am. train for 45 min (and like 15 min buffer time) - 7 am get ready in the gym (shower/refresh, etc.) for work and leave at 7:20 am to walk to the gym (yes i could take public transportation which would take me 15 min instead of 40 but i need to get in my steps and i have to get to work so i wont skip them. i also wont hit the gym after work bc my discipline is lower than and also it way too packed and i have a sponateous social life. so work, adding in a lucnh walk (30min), ideally walking home for 1 h (i end at 4pm) - to hit 20k steps for the day and adding in 4x cardio a week after work for 45 min. then having to cook, stretch bc its also important, keep my apartement clean, beauty routines (hair, skin, etc care) and it easily 9 pm again. that  leaves very little time for buffers - i planned it in realistic time slots.

yeah so i could say yes to a friend meet and then do my cardio session on one of my rest days and take that day as a spontaneous rest day thats not the problem.

i just think you have to hit so many things for it to be a realistic sustainable healthy weight loss - bc just starve is so easy (not always easy in terms of hunger or energy) but easy in terms of you dont need to make time or exercise or cooking healthy as long as its as little calories as possible. i miss the simplicity. like i feel like the bare minimum is already taking up so much time and mental effort and i dont want to make working out and weight loss my whole identity and my only hobby bc its detrimental to my mental health and relationships

i also want to include other hobbies like sewing, reading, movies, painting, etc. but idk when to schedule them except maybe a bit on the weekend. yk. i just wanna know how people do it all without having no life at all or feeling so overwhelmed. if you think its only excuses you can tell but give me actionable tips and not just shaming. idk i need to vent but i also need some tips on how to actually achieve a healthy life and healthy weight loss in a sustainable way.",2025-08-08 09:00:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mkq6wn/how_do_yall_balance_it_all/

I am skinny fat, I weigh about 60kg (132lbs) and I am 167cm (5 ft 5), but I haven't exercised in years at all, so my physical state is bad.

1mgf0fj,loseit,My journey. 230 to 180. And still going.,"I am 54 man. Started December 24th. Too scared to weigh myself and see a number I don‚Äôt want to see. I think I was around 230. On January I was 221.6 lbs. i lost ten ish pounds. Knees felt better. 

At 200 people started noticing. At 190 lots of comments. Today am about 180. 

Had biometric screening at work last week. Hit all goals. Lady said barely anyone put up numbers like mine. 

My thoughts on reasons for my success. Mindset. I used Glenn Harolds book on weight loss. Listened a few times that first day to absorb the info. That got my mind right and made it easy. 

Pickleball with wife and neighbors. Not competitive. We keep score but don‚Äôt try to crush each other. Socially fun and great cardio. 

Chilled out weight lifting a couple of times a week at most. Probably six times a month. 

Mindset evolution. I went from the Glenn Harrold mentality and moved further into it. I am now convinced it is easier to eat healthy. And much harder to eat junk food or too much food. I don‚Äôt view avoiding junk food as sacrifice. I view eating desserts and high carbs as the harder thing to do. 

I realize that imagining losing 20 lbs or more as a difficult achievement is the wrong approach. That is where people get it wrong. If it‚Äôs mind over matter or will power that vast majority will fail. Most quickly. The rest over time. It‚Äôs unsustainable. The mindset needed is that it is actually easier to be thin and healthy. It‚Äôs not some amazing achievement. It‚Äôs easy. 

Well that‚Äôs my two cents. And I have gone from 230 to current 180 since December 24 2024. I have lost seven lbs the last month. I am still going.

1mg2v31,loseit,Looking for support - day 22 of my new life,"I am 29F and I gained 25kg in 5 years, from 64 to 89kg, since COVID. Now I want to get back to 64. It has been 3 weeks, and I've lost 3kg (which is mostly water, I know), and I am looking for a support community to help me in my journey. Feel free to leave your story, or any comments/feedback/support message really. 

P.S. Sorry for the longer post and inconsistent thoughts. Also, English is not my native. 

So here it is. 

I tried and failed so many times, but now I finally do not want to just lose the weight - I want to have a healthier life and develop some healthy habits. It's clich√©, I know, but it really is just that. I want to lose weight and, in the process, develop habits I can keep for the rest of my life. That's why I've decided not to give up on anything that I cannot imagine my life without, e.g., if I know I cannot go for the rest of my life without any chocolate, then I will not forbid myself chocolate now. I just want to be in control again. And I think that was the reason I was failing in the past. So I've finally started something that I think might work.¬†

I've written down my biggest problems:

* Not being consistent.¬†
* Eating large portions and an inability to stop when I am full.
* Impulsive eating, even when I am not hungry.
* Not being able to resist when people around me eat.
* ""Ok, I've eaten this, let's eat everything then, the day went to hell anyway"" mindset.
* Snacks and junk food.
* Social drinking, even when I am not feeling like it.
* Almost no physical activity.

What I‚Äôve started:

* Fasting 16:8.
* Food logging.
* Walking.

Fasting and food logging help me keep my portions reasonable. At the beginning, I was forcing and struggling not to get a second plate (repete in Serbian) for lunch, to resist when the others were eating. Now I am more prepared, and I finally feel like I am in control. E.g., if I know there will be pancakes in the office, I will eat salad for lunch, and take one pancake and not 5. Or if I am hanging out with friends, I will snack on grapes, and not chips.¬†I do not drink alcohol just because it's a celebration, and fasting helps me with avoiding junk food, late snacking, and impulsive eating. 

Fasting is also hard sometimes, but it kinda works for me because we are having luch at noon every day in the office, and I usually skip breakfast anyway, so fasting fitted in well (although giving up my morning coffee is the hardest part rn).

I also started walking because I felt like a walrus while rotting in the apartment/office throughout a day and I was sad for not being able to share my husband's hobby with him (hiking and mountineering).¬†

**But the most important thing** is that I do not do it perfectly every day. Sometimes I eat more then my calory goal, sometimes I fast only 14 or even 12 hours. I have a cheat day. I do not go for a walk every day and I do not have steps goal yet because even going outside is currently big deal for me.

I log into a food journal every day, and share my progress, some affirmations, and gratitudes toward myself. It might sound silly but i chat with Chat GPT about my progress a lot, and it really helps. This, along with walking and fasting, helps me being more consistent and building a habit for once in my life.¬†

And honestly, although some days are still hard, especially when I feel like I am not in control, mostly I really feel awesome. I already see that, e.g., right now, I am not obsessing over food or the fact that I started with fasting. I also stopped (in 75% cases) obsessing and constantly thinking about my next meal and how to fit in the food in my calorie goal. Instead, I eat what I want (as long as it is not junk, although sometimes I include kebab or popcorn or stuff like that) and generally try making healthier choices. I am still trying to fully convince myself that being reasonable and eating mindfully, and what I‚Äôve decided to eat, is more important than the number of calories.¬†I learned that it is important not to punish myself when I ""make a mistake"", because that really backfires into ""ok I'll eat pizza now, and then fast for 24h"", and then hate the whole world. But also, if I eat pizza, I do not let go of a whole day, I just try to go back to the routine like nothing happened. However, I  still struggle often with being harsh to myself after mistakes like these.

Of course, I still fear that it might all backfire, I do not have a confidence yet to say it will 100% work, but I am hopefull.

\---

Some backstory, if anyone is interested.

Before, I was going to the dancing classed my whole life, and I always eated a lot, but I guess dancing and walking around more, stopped the weight. Then came the lockdown and I started my first job that was very stresfull, and everything went to hell.

When I first reached 70kg and then 75kg I felt devastated. Although now I would be happy with that weight. I always liked dressing nicely, and I felt so ugly at the beginning that I totally lost any will for fashion, or taking care of how I look. I was bying dull and plain clothes, too much oversized.

It wasn't until two years ago that I finally accepted my new weight and started buying clothes according to my style again, buying accessories, dressing up for work, and makeup, etc. I somehow lost that ""there's no point in dressing up when you're fat and ugly anyway"" attitude. And I am still not sure what happened exactly, but I am so grateful that it did, and I often feel beautiful now, even with my imperfect body. Although I still do not feel beautiful when I am naked. 

During the past 5 years, I've lost count of how many times I was starting with a diet or exercise. When I got engaged 2 years ago, I even took a personal trainer, but nothing worked; I hated her, the gym, and the diets. I hated every advice my fianc√© (now husband) would give me, and all the clothes I could not buy anymore. I felt so ashamed of myself for constantly failing, and I felt ashamed even for mentioning that I started again.

1mfy6rd,loseit,Lost 6 pounds in 2 months from calorie counting alone,"I‚Äôve been struggling with my weight since the pandemic. Since 2020, I‚Äôve gained 60 pounds. Now in most of the time since, I wasn‚Äôt really doing much to try to lose weight. I went through several periods where I felt bad about myself, decided to start exercising and trying to eat better, did well for a few weeks/months and then fell off. Usually my excuse was that it wasn‚Äôt working, or it was just too hard. 

A few months ago, while feeling bad about myself and browsing this sub, I came across several posts discussing weight loss without exercise. The comments were full of people claiming that calorie deficit is the only thing that matters and that you can exercise all you want and not lose a single pound if you‚Äôre not watching your calories. They also said you could lose weight without exercising at all, as long as you‚Äôre in a calorie deficit. This felt oddly discouraging and encouraging to me at the same time. I always felt like changing my food habits was too hard, so I‚Äôd always focused more on exercise. I was one of those people who thought / wished I could lose weight if I just jogged enough or did enough jumping jacks. It‚Äôd be so much simpler. But I decided to try tracking my calories anyway. I used an online calorie calculator to figure out how much I should be eating, downloaded an app, and started tracking all my foods. 

2 months later, I‚Äôm down 6 pounds!! It‚Äôs not a lot, and it‚Äôs less than the ‚Äúpound per week‚Äù, but I am so proud of myself anyway. It‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever been able to lose, and it‚Äôs not as terrible as I always made it out to be in my head. Does it totally suck sometimes? Absolutely. Do I sometimes have to deal with being hungry? Yes. But I‚Äôve been able to keep most of the foods I love and still lose weight. I still eat fast food. I still drink soda and eat Hot Cheetos. The difference is, I track everything, eat less, plan out my meals and snacks, and make sure I don‚Äôt go over my calorie limit. I made small changes, like ordering less food or lower calorie foods at fast food places, pouring my Cheetos into a ziploc bag or on a plate instead of eating them straight out of the bag. It‚Äôs worked for me and allowed me to start slowly. 

My biggest lesson has been that you don‚Äôt have to change your diet overnight. Should I eventually cut out the sodas and go out for fast food less often? Definitely. And I will. But you don‚Äôt need to do it right away. Making big changes too quickly is a good way to make sure they don‚Äôt stick. So for now, I track my calories and that‚Äôs all. I still eat junk food, but I plan for it and track it. I don‚Äôt exercise, though I do plan to incorporate that into my new lifestyle. I‚Äôm making small changes, and it‚Äôs working! So if you‚Äôve been wondering if you really need to track your calories, the answer is yes! Try it, at least for a few weeks, and see how it goes. My dad has been going to the gym multiple times a week since the start of the year and not lost a single pound. I told him I‚Äôd lost 5 pounds by tracking my calories and he immediately downloaded an app and is now tracking his too! So I hope that by sharing this small part of my journey, it might encourage some of you, too.

I‚Äôm 25 now and I‚Äôve been trying to lose my belly for what feels like a decade. I‚Äôve gone through phases of motivation where I‚Äôd lose some weight, only to gain it back, and I still can‚Äôt seem to get rid of this stubborn fat around my midsection.

Things I‚Äôve tried:

	‚Ä¢	Calorie deficits (sometimes too aggressive, which led to bingeing)
	‚Ä¢	Cardio (walking 10k+ steps a day, occasional runs) and weekly boxing sessions 
	‚Ä¢	Weight training on and off over the years
	‚Ä¢	Cutting out junk food and eating ‚Äúclean‚Äù (but consistency is my biggest issue)

1mfoi7u,loseit,Cals and workouts,"Hey guys I've recently started my weight loss journey and I had  questions. 

So firstly I'm a Little confused about the deficit thing. So from what I'm being told all Cal's are bad and it doesn't matter what you eat as long as it's below what you loose but you still need to eat like 1500? 

Eating a fruit salad with some Greek yoghurt  and some scramble eggs with tuna ends up being say 600cals but that's still bad and will stop your weight loss?

And people tell me just a 10k walk a day is enough to loose weight but that only cut's like 500cals which pretty much any food good or bad will wipe. So what's the right way to do this. 

On the topic of working out though would a 10k walk everyday while completely cutting out junk food and any bad drinks, having a cal limit of 1500 and swimming for an hour or two in Saturday and Sunday really be enough?

For all new people that have joined this month, at the start of the month we do a roundup of what happened. We'll also talk about our goals for August.

**How was your last month?**

You're free to structure this however you want, but think about the following topics:

- How has your weight loss progressed? Better, or worse than expected?
- What are some Non Scale Victories that you've experienced this month?
- Did you set goals, did you keep to them?
- What went well during last month, what could need improvement?
- What important lessons did you learn?

**Today is also the goal-setting day for the coming month!!**

If you're new, every first day of the month we think about small goals we want to achieve this month. They can be weight goals, exercise goals, or anything really... An important aspect is that they are SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time based...

- Do you have a goal weight for this month, if yes, what is it? For example: maintain a 0.5kg loss a week.
- Do you have exercise goals? For instance, get in 10.000k steps a day
- What plans do you have for your diet? Do you have goals there?
- What are some non-weight/exercise-related goals you have? Here, get creative. Past participants have used this section to stay accountable for their homework, learning languages, pledging not to order junk food, ...

1mdwmy6,loseit,Is the hard truth it's best if some people just abstain from junk food entirely.,"Hello, I have lost 150 lb over the past 2 years and I'm finally at a healthy weight for a man my size. To be blunt, I enjoy food WAYYYYY too much and once I start I cannot stop. I don't think it's anything to do with me not eating enough or me being addicted to food I think it is just pure gluttony. Just yesterday I had a 2 and a half pound bag of Tyson chicken tenders a pint of ice cream, a mini pie and a family size packet of Oreos. I don't know if this is a result of the junk food but also been super lazy recently haven't been exercising as much as I should and can't even be motivated to read books or watch movies on my to-do list. 

A few weeks back I actually had a good 3 week streak of eating only clean food ( fiber One cereal, lean pork chops, Greek yogurt with nuts mixed in etc.), I was going on daily walks, even running twice a week on top of weight lifting. The cravings for the first time in a while almost disappeared but then I went on vacation and decided to pig out and have not been doing too well since then. 

Is the hard truth that junk food should only be something I partake in once every few months as I have shown that I just cannot stop once I start to eat junk food? I asked this in another health subreddit in someone who said they also struggle with junk food said that they have just decided to cut it out of their life and as a result have not had any cravings since then and that was definitely something I experienced during that 3 weeks streak of clean eating.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies. I have decided it is best if I try to cut out junk from my life except maybe once or twce a year and replace it with healthier alternatives(rice cakes, low sugar beef jerky, baked chips etc.)",2025-07-31 09:06:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mdwmy6/is_the_hard_truth_its_best_if_some_people_just/
1mdg8l7,loseit,What helped make your diet / routine stick?,"TL;DR  25, 6'3"", 335  Starting college and want to turn my life around, just not sure how to make what I've tried so many times actually stick.

So going off the TL;DR, I've tried every diet I can think of.  Starvation diet, calorie counting, weighing food, meal replacement (ka'chava, protein shakes, etc), pre-packaged meals, meal plans

My heaviest was 380 pounds, so I've lost roughly 50 over the years, but that wasn't trying, it was just dumb luck...

I love healthy food, I'm not picky in the least.  I'm a good cook, and I can make anything I eat taste pretty good.  I just eat more crave and let myself eat more junk food than I do healthy food.

I fall off the wagon every single time.  Sometimes a week in, sometimes two months in, but I always do.

I've been obese or morbidly obese my entire life, I can't remember an age where I was anything but one of those two.

Time for the venting part; I grew up dirt poor, food was the only source of fun/enjoyment my family had.  My brothers ate less than I did, and also participated in school stuff, sports, etc.

I was too overweight already to do any sports, I just sat home all day, being 'homeschooled', but not by choice.

I wasn't taught anything beyond third grade, and wasn't allowed to go outside very often.

This became a cycle of wake up, play video games and eat unhealthy crap, go to sleep, repeat.

It wasn't until I was 19 or 20 when all the fat jokes, etc, started getting to me, and I decided to change.

I subscribed to all the big fitness YouTubers, tried all the diets, but I couldn't handle the judgment from family members.  Declining junk food and wanting a salad or just some chicken instead was made fun of, looked down on, and judged.  I let that judgment and 'shaming' get to me again and again.

Fast forward a few years; I'm exactly where I was.  I'm 330-ish pounds, 6'3"", 25 years old, living with my mom, who has the same unhealthy eating / exercise habits as she did when I was a kid.

I taught myself all the way up to high school / college education, I'm working on getting my driver's license, and I'm starting college in August.

I still find myself feeling almost shameful when I try to eat healthy, exercise, etc.

Over the years, I've bought a treadmill, barbell, bench, and plates, but haven't used them due to the uncomfortable feeling of being judged.

Recently I keep swearing to myself, this is the time you'll get healthy, this is it, no more excuses, this is the time.

I fall off within a few days.

So... Is there anyone else that was in my situation, or maybe near it, with that feeling of shame and judgment, who managed to get past it and have their decision to change stick?

I don't want to be who I am anymore, making excuses for everything, and worse, actually letting myself believe them.

My brothers are supportive.  I'm the youngest of them, but they all live further away.  My whole life they're always told me, if you lose weight you'd be a beast, etc.  I'm the tallest of them, strongest of them, and broadest of them, and they all tell me I'm wasting my potential.

This is a far cry from how they were until they all moved out, as they were the worst cause of the shame I felt.

Please give any sort of advice you can, I'll try anything.

I want to be able to even do a single push-up, and I  want to be able to jog or run for over 2 or 3 minutes without feeling pain in my chest.   Body-weight exercises always look so freeing and natural, and I want that for myself.    
  
I love my treadmill, and I love my weight set, just not the feeling I get from other people when I use them.

And if there's any advice out there to help in not letting what people say or think get to you, I'm more than willing to hear that out, too, and actually give it a shot.",2025-07-30 19:37:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mdg8l7/what_helped_make_your_diet_routine_stick/
1mcw0sb,loseit,Advice,"Hello! 

I am a 19 y/o female. My whole life, I was severely overweight. My weight topped around 180lbs, and I am not that tall. Over the last couple years, i have lost around 50 lbs, currently weighing in at 128.6 lbs. 

I did this through fairly consistent cardio exercises, as well as learning to control my sugar/junk food cravings. 

I have noticed that I carry a lot of fat in my stomach/hip region, and was wondering if anybody has any advice on how to loose this excess fat? I know spot fat burning isn't really a thing, so I was just wondering if anybody had faced/faces a similar issue and what worked for you?

I also suffer from a hypermobility disorder, which makes certain types of exercise difficult for me.

If i get hungry i try eating good/healthy foods. I eat honey; oatmeal, peanut butter, chocolate and even mochi ice cream daily. I eat foods i love. I eat fruits and vegetables. I try to eat fats as well (walnuts, almonds). But im still craving junk food. This afternoon i had cravings. I tried eating good foods (2 dates with peanut butter and almond, dark chocolate ; cottage cheese and chickpeas ; berries) but i understood i needed junk so i ate chips, cereal, nutella on rice cake, ice cream, candies and other things like that bcs nothing else satisfied me. I portioned controlled it but didn‚Äôt count cals and i know im way over my limit. Im a bit disappointed at myself.

I've losing weight for about 8 months; I started doing this in secret, without telling my family, but some weeks ago my mum talked with me and confessed to know what I was doing, what she was waiting for me to be ready for talking about it.
I'm not doing much of a diet, but I eating less junk food, doing more exercise every single day and also walking a minimum of 10.000 per day, which its not much, but as I dont go alone for walks, its what I can.

I've lost around 16kg, and I'm about 12 away from my ideal weight

My parents started explaining that, for a healthy weight loss, at first you lose a lot, and then you start losing like 1'5-2kg per month.

Now that its summer in my country, Im controlling more what I eat and in two weeks I lost nearly 4kg. This post is because idk if this is okay, or if it is unhealthy to lose that amount in only two weeks...

1m9qw5g,loseit,I feel like I am CONDEMNED to be fat FOREVE,"Okay, so real talk: my entire life has been, for lack of a better word, a dumpster fire. Seriously, since I was a little kid, it's just been one anxiety attack after another, mental hangups for days, just non-stop problems.

And food? Man, food has always been my ride-or-die. It's the one constant, through the good, the bad, and the utterly mediocre. Parents screaming at me when I was small? I'd sneak a chocolate bar from the kitchen, shove it down, and suddenly the pain wasn't so bad. Failed an exam? Pizza night, baby! Drown your sorrows in pepperoni.

Even for the good stuff. Got my first job ever? You know where I went? Straight to Burger King to celebrate. No question.

And to make it worse, I'm HUNGRY ALL THE DAMN TIME. Like, from the second I open my eyes until I finally crash, I'm just shoveling WHATEVER I CAN FIND into my mouth. Zero self-control, unless it's literally not within arm's reach. And that's the absolute killer.

We are so utterly SURROUNDED and BOMBARDED by junk food. Imagine if a crack addict could just pick up their drug of choice at every corner store, in bulk. That's my life, basically.

I've hit up therapists, seen a registered dietitian, and guess what? Still here. 26 years old and I could probably audition for a ""before"" picture in a weight-loss ad. The real kicker is, I get all pumped up and motivated, but within a month or two, that discipline just evaporates. Because, let's be real, you're not gonna suggest a salad bar when you're meeting friends for drinks, right? It's just not how it works.

I have this deep, physical need to eat for pure pleasure. It's my DRUG. Full stop. And I honestly don't see a way out of it.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to drop dead from a heart attack by 40. I've been trying to change this for over a decade now, and it's just failure after failure after failure.

1. I was under high stress around puberty due to having a parent in active addiction and then prison‚Äî this is when I first became overweight. 

2. When I was a teenager I was responsible for a lot of my own meals and ate very quickly, so I‚Äôd overeat without meaning to. I also didn‚Äôt understand nutrition or how to prepare anything besides pasta and canned goods. I didn‚Äôt eat much ultra processed/hyper palatable food or soda but definitely too much dairy and fatty/salty foods. 

3. I was in a stressful degree program in college, plus I went on nexplanon which made me gain 50 lbs.

Bonus: had a baby last year which put me over 200 lbs for the first time in my life.

I can go to the gym or a fitness class no problem and that stops me from thinking about food. The issue comes during the rest of the time - during work, during the time between meals, during hanging out with friends, during chilling at home. 


I just can't stop it. I'm not even physically hungry half the time. I literally could have had a nutritious and balanced meal with enough calories fibre and protein and after an hour I'll be thinking about food again. Then at some point I'll break and either have junk food or binge on a random food such as plain pasta with feta and honey or something just as deranged.

1m7a6ky,loseit,1 year update: 50 lbs lost by making mostly small changes,"One year ago at a doctor's appointment, I was told I had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and I knew my weight was too high. This was the first time in my life that my tests had came back with poor readings. So, I decided to make some mostly small changes in my life.

For example, I always walked, but increased my walking to 30-35 miles per week. Just walking, not even speed walking. I have been swimming recreationally 1-2 times per week, when the weather is nice.

I also got rid of all the junk food in the house, as I have a willpower problem. I cut out all the junk food totally this past year.

In addition, I stopped eating all fast food this past year. I also stopped eating after dinner, just the occasional healthy snack.

My doctor had recommended the ""Mediterranean Diet"", so I incorporated this into my life: eating fish more often, eating no red meat, eating very occasional chicken, having more fruits, vegetables, and legumes (lentils, beans). And I detested fish before this, now I can manage it. Luckily, I never drank soft drinks before, and mainly drink water.

Just these changes on their own caused me to lose 35 lbs the first 3.5 months. It hasn't been particularly hard for me and I'm never hungry. I've dropped 1-2 sizes, so I have had to replace many pieces of clothing. My total weight loss in one year is 50 lbs.

Now, I have noticed that for the past few months my weight has plateaued. A little bit discouraging, but I have noticed a body redistribution with less fat and more muscle. At this stage, if I wish to lose more weight I will need to join a gym, which I have been reluctant to do prior to this. My logic had been to see how much weight I could lose by being reasonable and not pushing myself too much, because I want my weight loss to be sustainable.

Next steps: I am looking to lose between 20-30 additional lbs and that will be it. I'm expecting that the weight will come off very slowly at this point, unless I transition to more strenuous exercise.",2025-07-23 14:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m7a6ky/1_year_update_50_lbs_lost_by_making_mostly_small/

I don't drink coffee but I drink about two cups of black tea a day.

Is it possible that anything to do with my diet/routine is causing this sudden exhaustion or might it be completely unrelated? ",2025-07-23 12:40:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m785zu/extremely_low_energy_all_of_a_sudden/
1m6iub9,loseit,Ever feel like you can never be that small?,"Hi everyone, 

I have been on a weight loss journey for about a year now, down 40Lbs. My original weight was 235lbs.. my UGW is 135-140lbs. The last time I weighed 135 was when I was 16, I am now 25. I gained a lot of weight in my 20‚Äôs from a bad relationship that caused me to be stressed almost 24/7 and my way of coping was eating junk and binging. Im now super happy and in a new relationship but often feel so insecure about the way I look especially in front of his family. The women on his side of the family are just naturally super tiny and petite, I feel like a giant when we take pictures beside each other. Anyways, I‚Äôve been slowly losing weight which is great but I seriously cannot picture myself being able to get small again. It literally just feels impossible to picture or even fathom the ability to lose another 60-70lbs. We do a hike every weekend, I play hockey 1-2 times a week, we try to play tennis atleast once a week. I know I‚Äôm active enough, I just can‚Äôt be disciplined enough to stay away from junk food and eating out. How do you guys stay motivated? When I eat something bad I know I shouldn‚Äôt be eating it.. and feel extremely guilty after.
I‚Äôm getting married in September 2026.. is it possible to lose this weight by then? 
I just want to feel happy and confident - my body image is on my mind almost every second of every day. Any advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated!",2025-07-22 16:32:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m6iub9/ever_feel_like_you_can_never_be_that_small/

I‚Äôm 35 years old, female, 375 lbs, and recently diagnosed with PCOS. I‚Äôve known for a while that I needed to do something about my weight, but I honestly feel overwhelmed and unsure where to even start ‚Äì especially when it comes to calories.

I‚Äôve seen some people my size say they eat 1500 calories a day, and others say that‚Äôs way too low and can hurt metabolism. Then there‚Äôs stuff about insulin resistance, low-carb diets, intermittent fasting, and my head is spinning. üòµ‚Äçüí´

That said, I‚Äôve already started making changes. I‚Äôm focusing on **low glycemic index foods**, eating more mindfully, and honestly ‚Äì I‚Äôm at a point where **junk food and sweets just don‚Äôt have a hold on me anymore**. I‚Äôve had enough of that cycle, and I‚Äôm committed to something better for myself.

Also, **despite my weight, I‚Äôm very mobile** ‚Äì I‚Äôm a stay-at-home mom, so I‚Äôm on my feet most of the day chasing after my kids, cleaning, cooking, and just generally moving around. On top of that, I do **two 20-minute walks daily on the treadmill**, and I plan to increase that over time.

What I need help with now is **figuring out how many calories I should be eating daily** ‚Äì specifically to **lose at least 13‚Äì15 lbs per month**. I know that‚Äôs ambitious, but I‚Äôm highly motivated and just want to start in a way that‚Äôs smart and not self-sabotaging.

If you‚Äôve been in a similar place, I‚Äôd love to know:

* **How many calories did you start with at a similar weight?**
* **Did PCOS make weight loss harder for you, what made it easier?**

1m5cg5b,loseit,"On the carnivore diet since June 1st, results are phenomenal","Heyo all, as i said in the title, i've been on the carnivore diet since June 1st of 2025, and i must say i am impressed. I only did 2 weeks of just a caloric deficit just to make my body get used to not eating as much and then i started it. I really don't know if im just feeling the ""high"" of all this weight loss but my health feels a lot better. At first, especially the first week, i felt super low on energy so much so that i could barely go for a 20 minute walk. After the first 4-5 days though all changed. I noticed daily that i started having more and more energy and i could work out better with weights. I have to say, even now, i still dont have that explosive strength for weight lifting meaning i cant go for PRs and all that, but I do my workouts no problem. I've always have had thin hair which makes my head look like im balding depending on my haircut, if i took shower, styling, etc. Yet now i can both see and feel that my hair as well as skin is a lot healthier than ever. Again this might be a placebo effect from feeling good about my weight loss so take it with a grain of salt. Now to the important stuff, I started in the middle of May or so weighing at 126 kilograms, 28 years old, male, 182cm height, with 0 exercise. Its the fattest i've ever been and i could not fit in any of my clothes which depressed me more and more as time went on. I would look myself in the mirror before going to work or going out and i really felt bad about how i looked, doing the classic thing all overweight guys do which is to suck in your belly as much as possible without others knowing. Today, the 21st of July 2025 I am at exactly 110 kg. As you can see its kind of on the extreme end of weight loss so here are some tips that you may wanna know if you plan to follow this diet, so you wont repeat the same mistakes i made.

1) **caloric deficit**. Be in a caloric deficit of around 250-500 calories depending on your starting weight and Daily caloric intake. I went to -1000 which was extreme and its mentally draining, while with half that i would be better and see pretty much the same results with the hunger kicking in. 

2) **Losing weight**. Losing weight in the beginning will feel like you're just brushing it off from your body. I averaged 2-3 kg loss per week. Ofc course that's a lot of water weight as well as glycogen storages getting emptied. But still, feels good getting on that scale every week and seeing all your hard work being rewarded.

3) **Working out**. Although this diet specifically works well with 0 exercise, adding a HIIT variation daily, 5 days a week, for 10-20 mins will make you both see better results as well as enhance your physical health. Overweight people like me are very weak in cardiovascular exercises, so working out in HIIT regiments will increase your overall health. Then later, once you get lighter and stronger and more mentally energized you can start working out properly, with the good old 3 sets of 8,10,12 or whichever workout you wanna follow.

4) **When to do it**. This fully comes down to your personal preference but for me, i see that im struggling with this diet now in the summer. You only eat protein and fats basically which in combination with the hot weather, doesn't make a very enjoyable experience. I feel almost every day that I wanna eat some fruits and vegetables , like watermelon. I wasnt a fruit guy ever but i dont know why, this diet now in the summer makes me crave them.

5) **Have a break**. You could have a good weekly break, like 3 weeks on carnivore 1 week off (but still in a caloric deficit) so you can eat ""whatever you want"" like fruits, peanut butter, jam, even junk food every now and then. Enjoy your break without going overboard all week, do it for a day and then eat normally for the rest of the week, just in a caloric deficit. 

6) **Dont use only a weight scale.** Take photos of yourselves every week. Check to see your differences. Count your waist and see how much fat/area you've lost. Feel and see how much stronger you've become. 

7) **Doing this to lose weight, not health problems.** I've read that the carnivore diet helps people that have some health problems but I am not a doctor nor did i research it in detail so i cant speak to that. Personally i only do it for weight loss, which means you can ""cheat"" on some stuff. Example, i drink coca cola zero, which doesnt take you out of ketosis, as well as take 2 teaspoons of psylium husk, which is a hack i wish i knew sooner. Psylium husk, besides the health benefit of it being pure fiber so it regulates your bowel movement and overall health, has the way of keeping you fuller for bigger periods of time because it becomes like jello in your stomach from all the water it absorbs. Trust me and take it, it will make the dieting so much easier its not even a joke.

I used to just lift weights but have started doing cardio recently as well (running and dance). I can tell I'm stronger, but I can't see any muscle definition or fat loss. My diet hasn't changed, it's healthy but I don't restrict myself on eating junk food when I want to - again I know this is the most sustainable option for me, I've never really bought into fad diets.

1d6w21o,xxfitness,How do you balance eating healthy when you go ‚Äúoff the wagon‚Äù? ,"Maybe this is the wrong place to post this, if so I‚Äôm sorry! 

So I just started eating healthy like basically five mins ago lol. I went from a lifetime of being addicted to fast food, using junk food as comfort, emotional binge eating‚ÄîBUT being ‚Äúskinny-fat,‚Äù always small-framed‚Äîto it catching up to me after turning 30 and I made huge changes and now am focusing on my blood sugar, what makes me feel satiated and energized, rather than waiting until I‚Äôm dying of starvation and then gorging on high fat high salt food and then feeling way too full to the point of a food coma which is how I always ate before. My mom had an eating disorder so I used binging as a kind of way to ‚Äúprove‚Äù to myself I wasn‚Äôt like her, I‚Äôve never been able to ‚Äúrestrict‚Äù without getting in my head about it so I swung the pendulum the other way to binging junk food and for a long time I ‚Äúgot away with it‚Äù bc of I guess a fast metabolism but I was eating like shit and then eventually feeling like it too. 

So fast forward to now, since January 1st I‚Äôve lost 20lbs (a lot was water weight and I weaned from breastfeeding which made me shed quickly too), and I‚Äôm currently in a 30 day no refined sugar challenge to break my addiction. I feel INCREDIBLE. But‚ÄîI have this complex about being ‚Äúthat mom‚Äù that eats differently than her family, gets a salad when we go out to eat, says ‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt eat that stuff‚Äù about fast food, sweets, etc. And I do want to eventually be able to enjoy the things I used to love, the junk that I realize now doesn‚Äôt make you feel good but is such a part of like standard American life lol, piles of chinese food, hot wings and fries, etc. Just in moderation now instead of as a staple of my diet. 

My question is‚Äîthose of you that figured out this whole healthy eating thing, but aren‚Äôt on a strict diet or on a calorie deficit, I guess it would be ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù‚Ä¶how do you balance? When I eat like I used to, like a restaurant or something, I feel that imminent  blood sugar spike and crash and I get scared of craving more of the same foods and getting stuck on that roller coaster again. And also, just practicially‚Äîgoing out to eat the portions are so insane, if you‚Äôre eating like a normal human and not binging like I used to, then you‚Äôll probably take home a box, which means leftovers the next day, so it kind of prolongs the indulgence‚Ä¶idk I‚Äôm so overthinking but how you go off-script and then come back I guess? My husband still eats like a college student and we are used to eating out a lot on weekends, and have cut down significantly but I still just want to figure out how to fit my new healthy eating jnto our lives without overhualing everything. Again sorry if this is the wrong place to post!

And also‚Äîif you were hypothetically about to spend five days with family who eats that standard diet you used to eat and you‚Äôre stressed about your blood sugar, and about falling totally off the wagon, but you canNOT request special dietary things or really say anything about how you‚Äôre eating differently bc it would become an enormous deal with them and annoy the shit out of you, how would you support your eating through that time period?

18825z4,xxfitness,Celebrating a year of fitness,"*Edited for greater clarity. English is not my first language and it gets rusty with every day I spend in this region...*

**TL;DR**

From Dec 2022 to Dec 2023, I have worked out (at least 30-45 minutes) on 201 days. That is 55% of a whole year (201/365 = approx 55%). This is also the year where I started to lift for real. These 12 months of fitness transformed me physically and emotionally, and I learnt a lot in the process.

Sorry, no before/after pics because I do not weigh myself. But hopefully this post has something that helps or encourages you. :)

**I was in a really bad state, physically and emotionally, in 2022**

* In Dec 2022, I finally had the opportunity to leave a soul-draining job. There were multiple compelling forces preventing me from leaving as early as I should have. By the time I left, the damages were already done. I would stay awake at 5AM, binge food delivery 20 times a month (I live in a region with cheap human labor) and constantly blame myself for every little thing. The best way to describe my physical and emotional state back then is to compare it to a pile of junk food: dressed up in artificial colors, yet deeply empty and toxic.
* Physically, I was probably in the worst shape of my life.
   * I never dared to weigh myself. Judging by eyeballing and the fit of my clothes, I was probably over 60kg (165cm). Before all of these, I stood at a pretty fit 53kg.
   * Pre-2022, I used to be able to run 5-6km regularly. But in my very sorry state of 2022, I couldn't even run 2.5km.
   * I had zero confidence to date.
* Emotionally: Self-loathing. I did not realise the extent of self-loathing I was suffering from until I was able to look back from a healthier place. This was not just due to the weight gain, but also many other things in my life...but I digress.

**What I did?**

* Because of my emotional state and previous history with disordered eating:
   * I did not weigh myself throughout, and relied on fit of clothes/the mirror instead.
   * Neither did I calorie-count. Instead, I simply wrote down what I ate in a day in Notion. After I started lifting, I made sure to up my protein intake.
   * I admit --- I totally could have seen better results had I counted calories! But hey, I am making room for my own psychology. If calorie-counting works for you, definitely do it. :)
* **Below is a list of work-outs/exercise programs I followed every month, from Dec 2022 to end of Nov 2023.**
   * **Dec 2022:** One of the four: 1) Walking 15-20K steps a day, or 2) Figurerobics by Jung Dayeon (30min) 3) Jillian Michael's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism (1hr) or 4) JM's No More Trouble Zones (1hr). These are ranked from low to high intensity.
      * Review: Exhausting but worth it. My hairstylist (whom I saw every month) said I lost a lot of weight when I met him again in Jan 2023.
   * **Jan 2023:**  Jillian Michael's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism (1hr) or No More Trouble Zones (1hr). 6 times a week.
   * **Feb:** 30minutes from BFBM or NMTZ a day, 6 days a week.
      * Review: I switched to a new program in March because I felt I got most out of BFBM/NMTZ, but still I highly recommend these!
   * **Mar:** [Lilly Sabri's 30-day fitness challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0MffRAbROw&ab_channel=LillySabri) (First 15 days)
      * Review: I remember visiting a department store in Mar and fitting into clothes that I could not fit in before. Ended up buying that piece with a smile on my face.
   * **Apr:** Taking a break. I travelled with a few friends who I had not met for 5 years, and they couldn't stop compliment my butt shape. üòâ
   * **May:** Lilly Sabri's 30-day fitness challenge (Last 15 days)
      * Review: Saw improvements in my butt and abdomen right after. Again, I was shopping for clothes with greater confidence.
   * **June:** Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30
   * **Mid July to late September:** TLS Phase 1
   * **Late Sept to end of Nov 2023:** TLS Phase 2
      * Review: Push-ups went from 2 reps to 15 reps in a set (or 21 with bad form, haha). Hip thrust went from 6kg x 12 to 40kg x 8. Squat: 9kg x 10 -> 35kg x 8. Deltoid definition I could only dream of a year ago. Continue to be able to fit into smaller clothes throughout this stage.
   * I also did some yoga here and there alongside the workouts I mentioned. These in total add up to 201 days. I use Notion to track my workouts.

**What improvements have I reaped?**

* Aesthetics:
   * Waist-wise: I lost 3 - 3.5 belt holes, and my sports bra are no longer tight around the under-boob area.
   * Lower-body-wise: I could fit into size S shorts. My leggings, which used to be super tight a year ago, are getting loose too (wrinkling).
   * Face: I could see all of my ears if I look straight into the mirror! üòÇ Well, imagine having one's ID photo taken --- now all of my ears are visible, even a bit of the tragus. That is a solid sign of my face is slimmer.
* **Physical health and energy:**
   * 2022 me would just sit in a sofa, whine and browse kpop news mindlessly over the weekend. True, 60kg+ at 165cm might not look like a lot but I remember distinctly that I was in such a state of perpetual lethargy back then.
   * Now my steps are lighter, and I feel like I have more enthusiasm and energy for things. It is still not where I would like things to be, but it is much better than 2022.
   * More regular BM and better sleep compared to start of 2023.
* **Emotional health:**
   * Being able to bounce back from setbacks faster: In the second half of 2023, I received multiple pieces of bad news. These would send 2022 me into a negative spiral, but 2023 me would take some time to grieve, take a deep breath, and go back to workout/reading/meditation/taking a walk. It is almost like a part of me simply refuses to torture myself.
   * **Greater self-understanding and effectiveness, which translates into other areas of my life:** I come to understand my own psychology better. For example, I thrive on a monthly plan where I get to regularly see improvements (or the lack of) and re-prioritise. So I extended beyond fitness and made monthly goals for myself. This really helped me cut away the noise, mindless browsing and anxiety to focus on the most important things.
   * Confidence: The knowledge that I am more than my job, that I can handle storms, and it is okay to care for oneself.

**What to do in 2024?**

* Continue: Make monthly fitness (and life) plans. Revisit and adjust at the end of each month. Lifting. Yoga.
* Start or do more:
   * Finding community. I post a lot in the daily threads here of r/xxfitness. It is such a little thing, but it helps tremendously.
   * Maybe, finding the confidence to go out, date and/or make friends. I am still very harsh on myself.
   * Counting calories: I think I am psychologically ready for this.
   * Running: In the deload week right after TLS Phase 2, I went for a few runs in the neighborhood. I did not realise how beautiful it was, lush and pristine in the early morning, despite having lived here for 3 years. My former coworker recently went to Japan to run a marathon, and I wanted to be like him too. Runners do get to experience the world differently.
* Stop or do less:
   * Order food delivery less. The best thing I can do is probably to stock up a lot of healthy snacks. This reduces the temptation to order food when one's running short on time.

That is it! :) Hope this post is helpful, or at least offers a dose of encouragement.",2023-12-01 03:48:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/18825z4/celebrating_a_year_of_fitness/
11jesds,xxfitness,Program Review: TSA 9 week intermediate program,"Tldr: First time running a program and it added +65kg/143lbs to my total max 

Background:
Always been an active person- with basketball and krav maga being the main sports I practiced. I was stronger than most of my male classmates up until I hit 15 (when the pandemic hit). 
The pandemic, mixed a traumatic life event, destroyed my physical and mental health which resulted in me getting addicted to junk food (and completely forgetting exercise). I obviously became very out of shape and depressed. 

Anyhow, I began exercising regularly again in January 2022! Went into a caloric deficit and started out running, eventually I started messing around with a set of 15kg dumbbells my dad had lying around. In August I officially joined a gym and began seriously weightlifting, this is when my numbers skyrocketed. During both of those periods of time I crafted and followed my own routine (I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS). It worked well enough for me to get me decent strength numbers, though 

During mid to late December 2022 I took a tiny break from lifting since I had to get my wisdom teeth removed and I also wanted to enjoy the holidays! This is also when I became tired of cutting and decided that I was ready to bulk. I was very scared of bulking, thinking I would only gain fat, but honestly it has been great and I feel like it seriously helped my strength and aesthetic gains. If you are scared to bulk like I was, please dont be, believe me when I say: trust the process. 

My diet, sleep and alcohol intake were all extremely good during all of this time (still is) Discipline is key! 

My (starting) stats: 18F / 5'5 / 64kg or 140 lbs
TDEE of ~2000, eating at a surplus of ~2250
-squat: 70kg x3 (SMITH MACHINE)
-bench: 40kg x1 
-deadlift: 90kg x1 

Goals: My goals going into this were simply to get stronger to ultimately reach my 2023 goals, which were a 1.5xBW squat, 2xBW deadlift and a 1xBW bench (spoiler alert; I reached all of them in just 8 weeks!!! :D ) 

Running the program: 
I started this program in January after I had healed from my wisdom teeth extraction. 
Week 1: i skipped the intro week altogether since I was too eager and excited to return to the gym lol
Week 2-3: got really sore both from the squat volume and me returning from my break! I only squatted 1x week beforehand and going into this program you can definitely feel the difference lol. Benching is also pretty frequent in this but I enjoyed it. Most difficult weeks out of the program imo
Week 4-5: The weighs feel so much easier ! Felt like I could do them for more reps so that's usually what I did (do 3 or 5 more reps)
Week 6: WOOAAHH confidence skyrockets as accessory work increases too- especially for the posterior chain! Back, hamstrings and glutes become stronger and bigger 
Week 7-8: Everything feels really light, I am hyped and ready for the test week
Week 9: success 

Ive noticed people say this program is boring, but to be honest I loved running it! I think it depends from person to person, if you are like me and like having structure, direction and dont get bored easily, you'll enjoy it :-)

-accessory work
I liked that the program didnt have any accessory work as I could implement what I already liked doing! did my own accessory work along with the program (I do PPL) 

-nutrition 
ate at a surplus of 250 the entire time, whole clean foods and high protein (170g) 

-fun
Just went out drinking one time and it didnt affect my performance whatsoever. I tried to be relaxed and stress free during the program. Got my +8 hrs of sleep everyday!! 

My (end) stats: 
18F / 5'5 / 68kg or 150 lbs
-squat: 100kg x1 (+30kg) 
-bench: 55kg x1 (+15kg) 
-deadlift: 120kg x1 (+20kg)
TOTAL INCREASE: +65kg 

Aesthetic results: Pleased with the posterior chain growth. My hamstrings exploded lol. Obviously the bulk helped the growth but damn I was honestly very surprised ! Other than that, biceps, shoulders and quads grew too. 

Conclusions:
After having experienced CNS fatigue in November from training too close to my 1RM too often, I GREATLY appreciated how the programming in this worked to avoid fatigue. I was surprised with the realization that I actually didnt need to absolutely destroy my body in order to get stronger. This program sets you up to win. As the weeks go by the weight just becomes easier and easier to lift, it almost felt like magic lmao. The confidence increase was also appreciated !! Went into my test week feeling determined.
The paused deadlifts were really good for mind muscle connection and improving form, highly reccomend! 
Amazing intermediate program altogether! 

What's next: 
I will re run this! I dont expect such increase in strength gains this time around tho since I start cutting in 2 weeks .",2023-03-05 21:41:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/11jesds/program_review_tsa_9_week_intermediate_program/

Every nutritionist and fitness expert, obesity doctor I've met have told me that for my height 55kg-60 kg should be the ideal weight. For now, my own personal goals are being 70kg, that is the weight i was about 5 years ago. I let myself go a lot, i am addicted to junk food. I also drink, which doesn't help things. But I've limited myself to drinking on the weekend just once in 2 weeks these days 

The diet I've been on recently in consultation with a nutritionist has me consuming only around 1350 calories per day on a daily basis. In addition to this, I've been consulting a physical fitness coach who has been advising me on small at home activities including walking to improve my fitness as well. 

One major problem I'm facing is that I'm so tired from the sudden decrease in calories that I'm not able to do even simple activities like walking and home workouts. 

How do I stop feeling tired? I cannot possible go back to consuming more calories because frankly for the first time in 5 years, I'm actually losing weight and i feel like i can get fitter and get over my medically diagnosed obesity so i can live healthier and for longer. 

Any advise would be appreciated! 

Do any of you have any tips on how to not feel tired? 

I feel super conscious discussing this with people in my life. Because well, they are all pretty fit. So they just think i should just start working out or running and I'll feel great. I don't know how to make them understand that it's not as easy mentally or physically for me. And that it's a flaw that I'm working on fixing.

If I try to push myself anyway, I feel like I did nothing because I couldn't do most of the exercises properly and feel more defeated than proud.

I eat healthily because I somehow manage to maintain my weight on stimulants and I rarely eat junk food. I just need to start working out but I feel like my starting point is much lower than average and I can't figure out how to start from that point.

Does anyone have any advice how to start strength training from a lower than average starting point?  


EDIT: I really did not expect so many replies when I made this thread but thank you so much! I've read all of your posts and they encouraged me to start working out. I did two Fitness Blender workouts and ngl I really sucked at it but I'm trying to make working out a routine especially because I can stick to things more easily since I'm on ADHD meds. ADHD sometimes makes it really hard to stick to something because I tend to lose interest quickly when it's not something instantly gratifying so my past ED + my inability to stick to any workout regime made me really weak. Most workout programs I've found were usually way too hard for me so I'm thankful for all of the tips that are actually beginner friendly!",2021-07-01 07:53:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/obgwkq/how_do_i_start_exercising_when_i_have_literally/
m6fp4j,xxfitness,"Started weight lifting, bummed about my lack of weight less","I was around 130 lbs before quarantine. Stayed extremely active for the first 3 months, got into better shape through running outdoors and doing Pilates at home. I started gaining weight at the end of the summer, because I got into a new relationship and all we did was make yummy food and order takeout. 
I‚Äôm now at around 150 lbs. I was also experiencing extreme stress related to school and my personal life, and I am diagnosed with Pcos, which might have played a role. I was 146 a couple of weeks ago. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm gaining fat or muscle because I have been eating a lot better - no junk food and overall reduced my caloric intake (I don‚Äôt track, but there‚Äôs a night and day difference between the types and amount of food I am now eating vs a few months ago.
I started going to the gym in the middle of January alone to do cardio once I got my covid vaccine. I did that for a few weeks, then started going to the gym with my bf on the weekends and he‚Äôs been teaching me to weight lift. We do the same workout with different weights. For example, a typical leg day consists of hip thrusts with a bar, squats on the assisted machine, kickbacks, and hip abductions. 
I‚Äôm challenging myself with weight as much as I can, yesterday I squatted 65 and did hip abductions with 170lbs. 

It‚Äôs really cool to feel stronger, but I am pretty concerned with the number on the scale. This is my absolute highest weight, before this I have never been over 135lbs. I‚Äôm trying to trust the process but it worries me to see the number on the scale go up. 

I understand that it could be water retention, muscle gain, or a bunch of other factors. But I can‚Äôt help but be worried that I‚Äôm just gaining weight and inching closer into overweight category. 

My question is, how long should I give myself to start a bigger caloric deficit? Should I add anything to my training? I am starting running again very soon, just waiting to buy new running shoes. I understand that I can‚Äôt lose weight  and build muscle at the same time, so I‚Äôm stumped.

m1mfh2,xxfitness,Cut or bulk or what?,"Hi! I'm 22, 5'4"", and trying to get down to a healthier body fat percentage (my goal is 27%.

Last year, I calorie counted and Youtube-worked-out my way from 162 lbs and 37% BF to 140 lbs and 32%BF. I think the calorie restriction (avg \~1450 cals/day for 5 or 6 months) took a toll on my muscles because it didn't decrease my body fat to where it should be at the BMI associated with that weight for my height. I took a break for a few months while I moved to another state, and started grad school (working from home, completely sedentary). About a month and a half ago, I jumped back into fitness, starting off at 145 lbs and 32.7% BF. I worked out 30minutes a day on average (combo of resistance training with bands and 7 lb dumbells, pilates and dancing), plus a 30 minute walk, and ate about 1750 cals/day on average. Today, I weighed in at 143.5 and got 32.8% body fat. I've lost 1/2 inch off my hips and 1/4 inch off my waist, yet my lean body mass supposedly dropped and my body fat percent didn't? I'm a little lost now, as to whether I'm supposed to keep cutting calories or supposed to eat in a surplus. If anything, I don't want to eat in surplus because I know the surplus will be made of junk food, like an extra daily chocolate bar, and I don't want to get back out of the healthy BMI range.

Any advice? Should I increase my calories to avoid losing more muscle and start a ""bulk"", or should I continue ""cutting"" for a while first?

lx3m30,xxfitness,Where to start again?,"Due to covid, my gym shut down for several months but they've recently been allowed to re-open again.  Prior to this period, I was consistently working out (getting pretty good heavy lifts and PR's in), eating well, and sleeping properly. However, once the gyms shut down, I fell off the bandwagon entirely and did not have motivation to work out (and thus no motivation to meal prep healthy food). This fed into a vicious cycle of lack of energy, poor sleep, and eating junk food. All in all, I've gained about 8lbs and, while I tried to throw in a couple of runs here or there, I just didn't find running to be as fun as lifting weights.

I'd like to break out of the cycle by starting small but would love some advice on where to start/any stories from people who've been able to start again and maintain a consistent routine after falling off hard. The hardest part seems to be getting the ball rolling again with eating healthy food and cutting out the junk food :(

lrl46o,xxfitness,Partner ‚Äútrying to help‚Äù is actually screwing up my weight loss.,"EDIT: wrong word! 
Hey friends. 
So I‚Äôve been trying to get healthier for the last year or so. I‚Äôm 29f. 
I‚Äôm currently 165cm and weigh roughly 97 kg. 
I have been working out 3-4x a week for around an hour per workout. 
I have lost around 25kg in the last 13months. 
My partner is 37m, 190cm and weighs about 105kg. 
He started out ignoring my attempts to get him to workout and eat better. Then he decided around month 6 of my journey to join in. He lost 15kg or so. Once he hit >100kg he stopped doing either of those things. 


In early November we moved house. Our eating took a marked decline into the junk range and my weight has pretty much been plateaued since November when previous to that I had been losing approximately 2kg a month. I had used a bmr calculator to figure out my daily calorie allowance with a deficit (around 1600 which is a 400 deficit from the recommendation of 2000 ish for maintenance). 


Now, I‚Äôm new to this fitness stuff, and had always heard that you SHOULD NEVER eat your exercise calories. From the very beginning, my partner was saying that I ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt been eating enough‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre starving yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúyour deficit should only be 500‚Äù. 


For those of you wondering I have a MyFitnessPal account that is set so friends can see my calories and food consumed, and a Garmin wearable with the same settings. My partner is one of those friends. I initially added him to keep myself accountable re snacking etc. 
Now, I am RARELY hungry in the mornings and would have a few cups of coffee with milk and sugar, and that normally does me until lunch time so I thought ‚Äúscrew it, I‚Äôll do IF with the fasting being between 10pm and noon (except for coffee). 


My partner said ‚Äúyou have to eat breakfast or your body will go into starvation mode!‚Äù So I started having some Greek yoghurt and granola or a single slice of toast with light cream cheese and cucumber for breakfast. 
In addition, back in October I had engaged a personal trainer. Previous to this I had been playing RingFit and doing cardio videos from YouTube. 
The PT and I had two sessions a week, for six weeks, during which I‚Äôd burn around 600-800 calories/session. 


I wasn‚Äôt at that point, going over my calories too much and was also struggling to HIT 1600/day. So mostly I was fine with +/-100 calories (total). 
My partner would say that my deficit was too high (bc he could see it on garmin) and would get grumpy and I would have a small snack (apple and a piece of cheese for example). 


He would say that the ‚Äúcalories in calories out‚Äù number in garmin needed to be under 500. 
So even though I had been losing around 2kg a month doing what I was doing, I started following that advice. Since November I have actually overall, gained around 0.2kg. 
Some other issues I‚Äôm faced with are: 
1: he constantly buys and eats snacks. Like unhealthy ones (fudge, crisps, beer, cider(my particular kryptonite) and there is always junk food in the house. 
2: on several occasions I‚Äôve had to tell him multiple times that ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want potatoes‚Äù ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt want rice‚Äù and this has actually resulted in several arguments. 
3: he always cooks high calorie, high fat meals for dinner when it‚Äôs his turn to cook, to the point that I have taken to having lighter lunches and no breakfast on the days he cooks dinner. 


Now, he and I have the same ‚Äúgoal weight‚Äù of 80kg (yes I know that‚Äôs still too high for me to be ideal but it was more that the idea of HALVING my weight when I started out seemed insurmountable), and he has, since November, regained around 6kg. 
I have suggested that we work out together (I mostly do HIIT and strength stuff with dumbbells and 2x cardio boxing) and he has always declined because ‚Äúhe prefers cycling‚Äù which is not something I enjoy. 


I have suggested that we eat more salads/vegetables or that we could eat separate dinners simultaneously (because he thinks filled pasta with grated cheese and butter on it is a ‚Äúsimple light dinner‚Äù. Uhm. No? That‚Äôs like 800cal), but ‚Äúwe need to eat dinner together!‚Äù and I don‚Äôt really want to cook every meal to be honest. I‚Äôm not his mom. 
I am just ridiculously frustrated with all of this and am wondering what I can do to fix it (both my plateau, and how my partner keeps ‚Äútrying to help‚Äù). How do YOU deal with family members who ‚Äútry to help‚Äù?",2021-02-24 19:24:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/lrl46o/partner_trying_to_help_is_actually_screwing_up_my/

I feel a little sad today, and a little uncomfortable.  I know a lot of people on a health journey struggle with this... lately, I feel like the people who originally supported and congratulated me on progress are no longer happy for me. I feel anxious to share or ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù my body shape change (wearing proper size clothing) and/or achievements because I‚Äôm starting to get negative feedback. I feel anxious that they think I am showing off or rubbing it in their faces. I get told that I‚Äôm overdoing it, that they think I‚Äôm great the way I was, that I should have a cheat day with them.  

 Today I jogged for three miles straight without my asthma acting up for the first time in my life. I‚Äôm enjoying exercise for the first time in my life. I feel like my mood is improving, my food preferences are changing, and I‚Äôm sweating less like Old Faithful every day (TMI?). 

  I hope I never go back to sitting on the couch all day. I was in such bad shape! I was full on junk food, negative thoughts, and pent-up stress. I started this journey because I wanted to fit into a bridesmaid dress before August and not spend a hundred bucks to buy a bigger one. Now it has become so much more.

Anyway, today I filled my Apple Watch activity rings for five consecutive days and I‚Äôm really thrilled about it.

kzrqai,xxfitness,Workout ideas for someone like me?,"I am a female,19 years old, 155cm and 41kg. I want to work out not to get slimmer, but instead to get abs and a more toned body. I've been doing Emi Wong's 15 min Beginner Workout for Fat Burning video on youtube and it's been almost two weeks. I'm thinking of maybe adding another workout or shifting to another one instead because I don't think this workout might be for me (though it is enjoyable and I do feel the burn sometimes). I don't watch out for my diet because I'm too slim, I wouldn't want to sacrifice junk food too XD but I mostly eat home-cooked food by my mom especially since the coronavirus came, I don't eat junk food as often as before. I barely drink any softdrinks as well, my mom doesn't allow it here and eventually I lost my cravings for softdrinks. Before coronavirus happened, when I used to be at my university at another city, there were lots of junkfood and fried food and that's all the food I ate, which made me gain weight into 46kg and it wasn't bad- it was the perfect weight for me (i was stresseating alot during that time because of college). But when coronavirus happened and I started staying with my family, we eat much healthier here and I ended up losing 5kg without even trying to.  I want to gain my weight back to 46 but honestly I first want to form abs and define my muscles more- I want to tone my body. Even if I can't gain weight anymore here, I just want to get a toned body but I don't know which workout video is best for me.

kgl3x0,xxfitness,"I already have a smaller waist and want to start working out, but I'm afraid I might become boxy?","So, hi everyone! Hope you all doing well :)

As the title says, I'm underweight (18f, around 48¬†kg/105lbs, 163¬†cm tall) and I already have a very small waist, I'm somewhat skinny fat (my tummy isn't flat, just a little bulging). I do have a nice booty that I'm proud of despite not really working out lol

I'm taking lots of vitamins (courtesy of the lockdown) and increased how many times I eat per day (and eat fairly healthy with few junk foods here and there). However, I don't gain weight at all. I already kind of exercising, by dancing like 3 to 4 times a week. I'd say I spend 30 to 45 minutes practicing dancing, which I guess helps me not gain weight. But ever since I was a kid I was a little stick, with just some changes here and there after puberty lol

I went to YT to see some workouts. I don't care much about abs, booty anything, I just want to get fitter. But I do care about my waist, I don't know if it's selfish, but I like that I got it with the genetics rather by exercising and would like to keep it, you know?

 I've read, though, that if I start working out too much that area/obliques it might become boxy? I see these influencers with these workouts for 'hourglass' shapes but wonder if they actually got results from it or were they just born with it, you know, or like 'is that even their REAL workout routine?' as some of them probably do other types of workouts such as weight lifting. 

I can't still go to a gym where I live, so I'm just thinking in ordering some resistances bands and doing workout at home for now and then later on get some weights (or go to the gym hopefully). 

But I wonder can I end up losing the shape? Or because mine it's genetic it won't happen so easily like that? Is it even possible to put on muscle and keep the waist that small? I'm thinking maybe following along to Pamela Reif workouts, I kinda like her vibe...

jf6pjl,xxfitness,Quarantine Body Transformation: March 2020 - October 2020,"I have been on and off of my workout routine and exercise since 2018, but this year's quarantine helped kick-start this journey. I started at 140 lbs in March 2020 and now I am at 125 lbs. I am proud of my progress and thought I'd share it with everyone.

**History:**

I started working out back in 2017, but never really got serious with it until 2018. I weighed around 125 lbs at the time and had little to no muscles. I did do tennis for three years in high school, but this was around 2015. I went on a really unhealthy diet for 3 months beginning of my freshman year of college back in 2016. I just wanted to lose as much weight as possible in a short amount of time. I was able to go down to 115 lbs , but my relationship with food became very toxic. I fell off that diet immediately and began to just eat whatever I wanted  because I starved myself for too long. Fast forward to 2017, I started lifting weights at our school gym. I didn‚Äôt know too much about lifting weights, and did whatever exercise/workout my friend was doing at the time. The workouts I did for 2017-2018 were very inconsistent, and sometimes I would even take month long breaks. But within these workouts, I was able to dead lift and squat 135 lbs. After college (beginning of 2019), I went through a break up and basically threw my diet and workout out the window. I did this for a while until I reached my highest weight yet, 140 lbs. It wasn‚Äôt until I was stuck in quarantine, looking at a body I wasn‚Äôt proud of, that really kick started this fitness journey. 

**Here are my before and after stats:**

**Before (March 2020)**

Height: 5‚Äô1

Weight: 140 lbs

**After (October 2020)**

Height: 5'1

Weight: 125 lbs

**Diet:**

Because I‚Äôve gone through multiple unhealthy diets, I needed to make sure this next attempt was sustainable. I wanted to take it on slowly and not be too strict with my diet. I decided to start intermittent fasting with a 16:8 window to help reduce my snacking (especially midnight snacking). It was definitely hard at first, but eventually I was able to make it a habit. While doing that, I also did a calorie deficit of 300 under my maintenance calorie of 1500 daily. I can‚Äôt remember what my specific macros were, but I want to say it was 30% protein, 20% fats, and 30% carbs. Like I said, I wasn‚Äôt too strict on myself, so as long as I was within my daily calories I was still okay. I also made it a habit to only treat myself with junk foods and unhealthy snacks on the weekends, but, of course, still being within the 1200 daily calories. I would also experiment with 24 hour fasts every other week. I did this diet consistently for 5 months. These past two months, I haven‚Äôt been as consistent because of work, and once I was able to reach 120 lbs, I decided I wanted to bulk up. Right now my daily calorie intake is around 1700 calories with about the same macro percentages. 

**Routine:**

My workout routine may be weird to some because I did the same workouts/exercise every time. I initially did this to make it easier on myself and not have to worry about thinking of new workouts and what not. I understand that I may have missed out on some crucial workouts that target other parts of the body, but I needed something that I could stick to. I will say that I barely did any lower body workouts because I hated any leg exercises that had to do with dumbbells. I preferred heavier weights. I also felt like there just wasn‚Äôt enough space inside my room for the movement it required. Or I could have just been giving myself an excuse. This was my M/W/F upper body workout routine:

Reverse fly 3 x 12 (5 lbs, 10 lbs)

Overhead Press 3 x 12 (20 lbs, 25 lbs)

Single arm Arnold press 3 x 15 (15 lbs)

Bicep Curls 3 x 12 (15 lbs)

Hammer curls 3 x 12 (15 lbs)

Overhead dumbbell triceps extension 3 x 15 (30 lbs)

Dumbbell Triceps Extensions 3 x 12 (15 lbs)

Push Ups 3 x 12 

Dumbbell Shrugs 3 x 12 (30 lbs)

I would go into more details but this was basically how it was and because I‚Äôm running out of time trying to write this out. Occasionally, I would increase the reps of certain workouts like bicep curls or triceps extensions and try to push until I was tired. I would post my leg routine, but it was basically non-existent during this journey. I‚Äôve just got  back into doing leg workouts this past week after getting my weights all set up in the backyard. Here is what it looks like:

Squats 3 x 8 (95, 115, 135 lbs)

Traditional Dead lifts 3 x 6 (95, 115, 135 lbs)

Sumo Dead lifts 3 x 6 (95, 115, 135 lbs)

Romanian Dead lifts 3 x 12 (60 lbs)

Hip Thrusts 3 x 12 (115 lbs)

Bulgarian Split Squat 3 x 12 (15 lbs)

Calf Raises 3 x 12 (115 lbs)

I never did any sort of cardio during this whole fitness journey. I wanted to, but I just couldn't get into the whole treadmill, HIIT, biking, etc workouts. I'm trying to get myself to enjoy it more now, but we'll see.

**Achievements**

During this journey, I didn‚Äôt regularly check my weight every week because I didn‚Äôt want to be discouraged every time I saw the number on the scale. I only did monthly weigh ins and this is what it looked like:

March 2020: 140 lbs

May 2020: 135 lbs

June 2020: 129 lbs

July 2020: 125 lbs

August 2020: 121 lbs

September 2020: 117 lbs

October 2020: 125 lbs

**Now:**

What I‚Äôve learned so far in this journey is that if you really want something, you gotta go for it. I know it‚Äôs cliche, but that was essentially what I had to do to get to where I‚Äôm at now. I couldn‚Äôt keep giving myself an excuse and putting it off. I knew that if I wanted to enjoy my youth the way I wanted to and in the body that I was proud of, I had to just start. I also didn‚Äôt think I would be able to do 24 hour fasts because of my love for food, but I surprised myself with that one. Right now I want to bulk up to gain more muscle mass, but also try to lean out. I‚Äôve heard of lean bulking, but don‚Äôt know too much about it. If any one can point me in the right direction as to how I can go about this correctly, my messages are open. Hope this was somewhat helpful. If you have other questions, feel free to message me directly. :)

jbe5vt,xxfitness,Developing a healthy relationship with the scale (note : extremely detailed!),"Adding the TLDR here since this post is quite long (I apologize for the length!) - 

TLDR: does anyone have tips on how to develop a healthier/objective relationship with the scale, stop associating my self-worth/value with the number, and learning to love my body, regardless of the number? 

Hi everyone!, I‚Äôm new to this community, so please excuse me if this question has already been answered previously (attempted to search it, but couldn‚Äôt find much results). Anyways, I‚Äôm quite new to idea of fitness for health (used to view it as a way of becoming ‚Äúskinny/thin‚Äù {nothing wrong with being either}). I would really love some suggestions as to how to go about this new journey given my background and current situation (as noted below). Thank you in advance to those who respond!


Background info:
I‚Äôve been formally dieting with 1,200~1,400kcal for the past 3 years (July ‚Äô17). I‚Äôve had periods of great results and consistent dieting, and then I‚Äôd veer off track and not diet for 3-6ish months, eventually regaining some weight. I have done CICO (favorite by far), ‚Äúhealthy/clean eating‚Äù (still implement this with my own definition), keto (too intense and stressful for me - switched to low carb and loving it rn), and intermittent fasting (did it for the longest time, didn‚Äôt realize it had a name until 2 years ago). Throughout those years, I developed an unhealthy relationship with food/nutrition and fitness, only viewing them as ways to get to my goal weight, not better my overall health. I would consistently exercise to burn off any calories that I consumed and would emotionally eat whenever the number on the scale would increase/stay the same. I realized that this was unhealthy and wanted to change this mindset. 

With quarantine, I took the initiative to develop a healthier and more positive relationship with food, my body, and fitness! So far, this journey has been great. I‚Äôve developed a healthier relationship with food (with the exception that I eat at maintenance with some junk food whenever I don‚Äôt get enough sleep) and look forward to eating now, instead of dreading what/how I‚Äôm going to eat. I‚Äôve also learned to love my body for what it can do and how amazing it is (still working on fully loving it). I‚Äôve learned to listen to my body and respect its cues instead of disregarding them (paying for it later on). I‚Äôm also proud to say that I‚Äôve gone from weighing myself everyday to weighing myself every 1-2 months (make sure I‚Äôm not drastically gaining weight). All seems well, but I realize that I‚Äôm still struggling with my relationship with the scale.

Current situation:

About 5 weeks ago (09/07), I watched some of Natacha Ocean√©‚Äôs videos and realized (with great resistance) that I was depriving my body of nutrients for my goals (noted below). Specifically, this video (link - https://youtu.be/Txl-m1_xbBw) reaffirmed the fact that my current (now past) eating and exercise habits and mindset were detrimental to my overall health and well-being. I took notes on the tips provided and came up with a plan to better my relationship with food (carbs=good!) and develop a new love for weight-lifting (sad to say goodbye to formal cardio). I‚Äôm currently implementing the information provided in the video (alongside with other research) and undergoing a period of slow caloric increase whilst doing a body-weight/dumb-bell focused program (currently doing Caroline Girvan‚Äôs 10 week program as I don‚Äôt have access to a gym right now).

My current problem - 
I just want to be able to weigh myself to know my BFP. I know that being at a high BFP is not optimal for long-term health. I want to ensure that I‚Äôm prioritizing my health by having a healthy BFP for my metrics. BFP isn‚Äôt everything, but it is a good indicator of physical health (as opposed to BMI), which is something I truly care about. 

My metrics
Sex: female 
Age: 19
Weight: 141 pds. as of 08/20/20 (heaviest was 184.2 in June, 2018)
Height: 5‚Äô4‚Äù/162cm
BFP: 26% (last-recorded) 
TDEE: 2,100kcal (last-recorded) 
Activity level: lightly active (walk 10,000-15,000 steps a day in addition to strength-training 4x a week)

Goals:
1. Build muscle, lose fat (essentially recomp.) and maintain my physique and fitness for the long term.
2. Develop strength (like that of Wonder Woman)
3. Be able to continuously do pushups with proper form (just a fun one)
4. Run a mile in <10 min. (I know this totally contradicts my weight training goal, but I would still like to try)

Questions:
1. Am I on the right track in terms of increasing my calories, weight-lifting and undergoing body recomposition?
2. Besides progress pics, how should I go about measuring progress?
3. Are there any suggested weight-lifting programs for beginners?

I truly just want to be able to look at that number and not feel so many negative emotions towards it. I‚Äôm tired of letting the number on the scale dictate my feelings and actions. I‚Äôm tired of feeling fat, unworthy, and undeserving whenever the number goes upwards or stalls.

iixzy5,xxfitness,My intuitive eating and how it helped me be truly ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù,"TLDR; I completely dropped calorie counting and realized how being healthy requires a healthy mind on top of good habits. Tracking works for many, but I learned the hard way that it just doesn‚Äôt for me. 

After years of restrictive CICO and disordered eating, I significantly upped my caloric limit in an attempt to heal back in December, though I still religiously tracked. However, since I was still so obsessed with numbers (my weight, macros, calories), I still felt out of control, and would still occasionally binge, despite not feeling ‚Äúhungry.‚Äù (Hello freshman 15. Naturally this only increased the feeling of being out of control.) 

It was only a bit over two months ago, when  I  started intuitive eating and completely let go of any calorie counting and numbers on the scale, that I began to feel truly healthy and happy‚Äîwhen I actively started listening to when and what my body needs. To be completely honest, it‚Äôs been life changing.  

I eat so much healthier, and feel so much healthier. I once thought my body naturally craved sugar and junk. It doesn‚Äôt‚Äîonce I stopped labelling food as ‚Äúallowed‚Äù or ‚Äúnot allowed,‚Äù it‚Äôs taken only small amounts of junk foods to satisfy me, and I‚Äôve realized that my body does indeed crave healthy, whole foods. I wanted junk BECAUSE I was restricting myself from said junk. Now, nothing is restricted, nothing is forbidden. Food has just become...food. 

I also no longer treat cooking as a chore to log into MFP, but a fun process to create something tasty and nourishing for me and my family. I no longer labor over weighing and logging every morsel and have found I love trying new and delicious ways to prepare whole, nutritious meals. 

Another pro: though I haven‚Äôt weighed myself since I stopped counting, my pants have gotten looser, and I can fit into my senior prom dress (I couldn‚Äôt before). And I haven‚Äôt been suffering from cravings! And this is all with a drastically reduced workout routine!  I haven‚Äôt even lost all that much strength on the few lifts I‚Äôve been able to do in quarantine. 

I honestly feel liberated. I can enjoy a cookie without any thought of calories or the fear of binging. A few days ago, I FORGOT about the cookies in our pantry. I feel I‚Äôve finally become ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù because I finally have a healthy mindset along with healthy habits. And after all, like everyone else, I love food. Why corrupt one of the few sources of happiness and pleasure available to us, especially in these difficult times? 

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of the diet-related discussion on this sub is centered around restriction. I think tracking can certainly be helpful in achieving fitness goals, but I also believe there‚Äôs a point at which trying to control every number and detail of one‚Äôs lifestyle becomes harmful. And if there‚Äôs anything quarantine has taught me, there‚Äôs going to plenty of moments in life that I can‚Äôt control. So why waste my time worrying about the inevitable moments of imbalance when I can just focus on feeling the healthiest, happiest, and strongest I possibly can?

Edit: thank you to all the ladies offering your own experiences and advice in the comments!! Also I‚Äôve found in these few months that I actually really love vegetables, so if you‚Äôd like to share your favorite ways to prepare them please come at me lol

hiyek0,xxfitness,No Junk July,"Come one come all!

I don't know about you, but I have been eating far too much ""junk"" food lately. Candy, chips, you name it.  My goal for July is to say no to all of that and focus on quality foods. I'm not making this complicated, there are no special macro ranges, calorie counts or the like. 

It's simply a conscious, daily effort to say no to the junk food I've been overeating on lately and instead focus on meal prepping healthy foods, going for fruits/veggies instead of cookies/candies and hopefully feel much better by the end of July.

gn54bp,xxfitness,"This year is the first time a new year resolution stuck - down 47 lbs, 5 to go to my goal, feeling stronger than I ever have before (progress pics, details, reflections)","I was never particularly thin as a child, but more importantly I was very much \*not\* athletically inclined from as far back as I can remember. I grew up in Romania where team sports in school or recreationally are not much of a thing, or my family was not in the right circles for that. We did go hiking, which was the only form of exercise in the family, and I enjoyed parts of it but also stopped participating as soon as I was old enough to opt out.

Partway through high school my family and I moved to the US - shortly afterwards I reached my lowest weight/BMI I can remember, around 20 BMI. I was not healthy, ate sparingly and mostly junk food, didn't exercise regularly but would occasionally go on long walks or such. It was a story of gradually accumulating weight from that point - the freshman 15, another few lbs gained when I moved in with my boyfriend (now husband), another few gained when I started my adult job after college with buffets 3 meals a day. Then came the kids, and I hung onto 10-15 lbs after each one that never came off. It was a case of drip drip drip effect where I never really thought of myself as outright unhealthy, I had the occasional streaks of more regular workout regimen or short lived dieting, but the trend remained largely the same. I even managed to train for a half marathon between the two kids, I'm including a side by side about that a bit later too, which contributed to my perception that I wasn't doing that bad.

Come end of 2019, my youngest was no longer a baby (she's 2), the scale was scowling at me and my BMI had just tipped me into the obese category - I know BMI is not a perfect measurement of course, but I wasn't particularly muscular or had other mitigating circumstances. I also took a dexa scan last year and it came back with 40% BF, which was not surprising but just confirmation something had to change (it was probably even higher by the end of the year tbh). So I made a resolution - I would take charge of my own well being, I didn't want to feel exhausted from a simple outing at the park with the kids, or need a nap during the afternoon on the weekends to make it through the day. Most of all, I wanted to set an example to the kids what it means to eat wholesome food and move your body with joy. My number goals included losing 40-45lbs (ideally a bit more) to get comfortably in ""healthy"" BMI range - I'm not looking for ideal weight/look, just to feel better in a few different ways - mentally, physically, emotionally.

My ""before"" weight sits at 187.6 lbs (I'm 5'4"", thus a BMI of 32.1).

I started the year with a dry-nuary challenge, I figured cutting out beer/wine would make it easier to cut calories. I signed up for Noom and committed to a calorie target and started tracking every day - I used a scale at home but did my best to measure/estimate at work, I wanted to see if a sustainable approach can work for me rather than a very restrictive overly planned diet that I would find hard to stick to. The pounds started finally coming off and it was encouraging and motivating, I started going to the gym a couple of times a week and hiking on the weekends with my husband. I was reaching my 10k step goal most days and feeling stronger week after week.

Then, the pandemic started, and I was stuck at home (I live in California, we've been under shelter in place orders for something like 9-10 weeks). I downloaded the 7 minute app - i think I saw it recommended on here - and I started doing the 30 day challenges plus a targeted workout here and there. I later picked up running again, I was pretty amazed how much easier it came with a much lower body weight - my joints are no longer angry with me and my speed is steadily improving. You can't imagine the difference, I had reached a point where jogging after the bus for 10 steps would make my ankles ache, and today I ran 4 miles without slowing down or stopping and zero pain, it's night and day!

What consistency in tracking and following Noom has taught me:

\- what proper portion size looks like - I often only track after I plate and eat my food and the totals fall very close to my mental targets per meal/snack

\- how to balance a plate to be both filling and satisfying - I haven't eliminated anything from my diet, but it has definitely shifted to a more plant based, fresh fruit and veggie rich selection

\- how to listen to my own hunger cues - I will eat an unplanned snack in between meals if I feel hungry, and I will treat myself to dessert if I'm feeling toothy, but I have been able to do that while sticking to my calorie budget and only very rarely going over.

\- being mindful when eating, working out, and in other moments of daily life - being present helps so much with mental well being but also with understanding how food makes me feel, when to adjust a workout for what my body needs at the moment

\- I found joy in working out! I'm looking forward to those daily challenges and I feel stir crazy on ""rest days"" designated by the app. I'll take a recovery day when needed but often I end up just doing more around the house or taking longer walks with the kids.

If you've made it this far, this is roughly my progression:

Starting weight, January 5th 2020: 187.6 lbs (32.1 BMI)

February 1st 2020: 174 lbs (29.9 BMI)

March 1st 2020: 162.2 lbs (27.8 BMI)

April 1st 2020: 151.8 lbs (26.1 BMI)

May 1st 2020: 144.6 lbs (24.8 BMI -- crossed that 25 threshold!)

Today: 140.4 lbs (24.1 BMI)

My hope is to reach 135lbs, that's when I felt good and spry in college :) But once I stop tracking as diligently I'll see which way things move and reassess. I am more confident now that listening to my body's needs will lead me in the right direction - time will tell.

Here are some progress pics, sorry for the poor before pics, I didn't put as much stock in my resolution as I should have so I don't have true ""before"" pics, just some personal images and later posed shots.

##About Me

I've never been a thin person, I've been overweight and inactive my entire life minus a couple years of disordered eating in high school where I was in the healthy weight range, but very unhealthy overall. The highest I've weighed myself was 255 lbs in 2016. Since then, I've gotten as low as 180, but always failed to maintain at a lower weight. My diets have always been very restictive and viewed as a temporary measure instead of a lifestyle change. I've had low energy, joint pain, and stomach issues for years and have not been active because of it. 

##Past Year
I was diagnosed with arthritis in 2018 and started a medication that works for me in the beginning of 2019. Over the last year, I've gone from 230 lbs down to 198 without counting calories, but just focusing on eating healthy, balanced meals and only when I'm hungry. I also found out that my stomach issues have been largely due to a soy allergy, which has helped with cutting out junk food (Good luck finding a snack cake without soy)

##Exercise
I haven't been exercising. My health issues have kept me from it, but I've now got things under enough control that I feel comfortable starting a strength training program. 

##Goals
They suggested a goal of 28% body fat, and somewhere withing the healthy weight range for my height. 

#At 140:
Bone mass: 7 lbs

Lean Mass: 95.79 lbs (+2.85)

Fat Mass: 37.24 lbs (-60.45)


#At 170:
Bone mass: 7 lbs

Lean Mass: 117.36 lbs (+24.42)

Fat Mass: 45.64 lbs (-52.05)


##Thoughts
Having my body fail me during daily tasks over the last couple years has really changed my perspective. I've really stopped shooting for losing X pounds or being Y size, and started striving to just take care of my body. I got the scan to use as a baseline for progress going forward, and to be able to put numbers to my goals. So on that side, it was a huge success. 

I'd be lying though if I said I wasn't a bit discouraged. At 55+ lbs lower than my highest, I'm still over 50% body fat. I know that my lean body massage is low (and I'm not surprised given my level of activity), but there's just something jarring about it nonetheless. 

I'm worried about trying to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time. I don't want to have to track macros or count calories because it's been a problem for me in the past, but not sure how realistic that is. I'm not super concerned about how long it takes to get to my goal, just that I make progress.",2020-03-02 18:37:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/fcgm0o/dexa_results_26f_511_1983_lbs_512_fat/
f1i5zo,xxfitness,Advice on next steps and adding to my workouts,"Hey all! Brand new to this sub and this is my first post ever on Reddit, so bear with me. (also not super familiar with all the fitness terms)

I am looking to add some muscle -- mainly get my abs to show a little more but gains elsewhere are welcome too. I'm 5'1"" and 120-125lbs. [Me currently](https://imgur.com/GEx9ayM) [Also me](https://imgur.com/U4HYNHG)

As of right now, I basically only do cardio. I'm an avid runner and I run 25-35 miles per week, usually in 5-6 runs a week. Although the physical benefits of running are nice, the real reason I run is because it makes me happy and is a stress reliever for me. This is something I'm not willing to give up so I'm looking for advice on adding additional workouts for building muscle. I have read this can be counter-productive in some ways (?) and if that's what's going to stop me from adding muscle, then that's okay with me because I'd rather feel good than look good, and running makes me feel really darn good.

My only strength training I've done is I'll sometimes do those 10-20 min YouTube videos for core, arms, etc but nothing consistent. It's difficult because I find almost all exercise that isn't running to be boring, and I'm admittedly not super motivated to make a change -- I'm not uncomfortable in my body, so there's not that drive to be more confident. Gaining muscle is more of just something I'd like to accomplish if possible.

As for my diet, I am a vegetarian but aside from that I pretty much eat whatever I want.  I don't count calories or keep record of any of my food intake. I've heard over and over that ""you can't out-run a bad diet"" but I have never been able to relate to that. I do get in a good amount of fruits and vegetables, it's just coupled with chips, brownies, ice cream, etc on a very regular basis. Also, if I have plans to go to the beach or something, I'll usually eat a bit healthier (ie: not eat junk food after 10pm like I normally do) for 3ish days beforehand, and I lose a bit of my belly chub very easily, which has been fine for me. I could probably make some positive changes fairly easily, but I've never needed to because as long as I'm running, I stay thin.

Anyway... I turn 22 at the end of March and want to make some kind of fitness plan for myself to follow between now and then. Obviously that's pretty short-term, and if I'm enjoying it I'll continue, but I've really never disciplined myself exercise / diet wise so I want to start small. I want my midsection to look more ""solid"" (hope that makes sense?) and overall make everything a little firmer. I'd like for it to be all at-home but I do have access to a gym if needed. I am also willing to make changes to my diet so any advice there would be welcome too.

First of all, yall are mega inspiring and I love reading everyone's updates in the daily threads. It makes me feel like I'm friends with a lot of you frequent posters, haha. I just turned the big 30 and as a birthday present to myself, I got a DEXA scan and VO2max test. 

[DEXA results, me the day of the text, me a couple days earlier mirin myself in the gym locker room, and VO2Max results](https://imgur.com/a/uXWICVY)

Current Diet:

I've been vegan for around 2 years, and was vegetarian for 2 years before that. I eat probably 80-90% whole foods. A typical day of eating for me is usually:

* black coffee for breakfast
* oatmeal with flax / peanut butter / bananas, or leftovers for lunch
* dinner is usually some combination of beans (chickpeas, black beans, tempeh, tofu, lentils), grains (rice, farro, millet) assorted vegetables (beets, carrots, onions, zucchini, peppers, broccoli, I could go on lol ...), and green leafies (I *love* collard greens, also kale, chard, cabbage). It varies a lot.
* I also eat a lot of fruit ‚Äî apples, blueberries, oranges
* late night snacks include popcorn, and whatever sweet baked experiment my fiance cooks up while stoned
* Gallon of water

I eat pretty clean during the week, but I'm not too strict about it and I won't say no to some junk food every now and then. I probably average around 2000 cals a day for maintenance. 

Current Routine:

I'm mostly a runner. I ran a marathon last spring, and once I achieved that goal I parlayed that into a new goal of running 1000 miles within the year, which I did. I also had a goal of getting a pullup, but I'm still working on that (but not really hard, lol). Over the summer I started incorporating more weight training and I really enjoy that too. I currently run 15-25 miles a week and lift two days a week. Current PRs (for reps) are: 135lb squat, 185lb DL, 70lb bench (haha), and 50lb OHP. I'm about to start a training plan for a half marathon this spring.

Going forward:

I was really surprised by those results! I was going to be happy at 26% BF, so this was pleasantly surprising. Very surprised by the low amount of visceral fat and low percentage of android fat, as I always thought my tum was one of my bigger areas. I also lost about 45 lbs several years ago, so I think I still have a heard time seeing my new bod objectively sometimes. 

The VO2Max test was again, surprising. I never thought I'd get into the ""superior"" category, but here we are. After strapping on a heart rate monitor and the darth vader mask, I then ran on the treadmill at a comfortable pace while the administrator gradually increased the incline. It was nice and easy at first but then, oh boy. When I asked what I could expect during the test, the doc jokingly said he was going to make me puke and ... I almost did y'all. Right into that mask. Worth it though?

I'm getting married later this year, so now I'm trying to decide on aesthetic goals for that. I think I'd like to get more swole, but also cut like 5-6 more lbs for better definition? What do you think?

erl3a4,xxfitness,Losing the last 8kgs and toning up after an already substantial weight loss,"Hi everyone!

I am 23 and 168cm tall. I have lost 47kgs so far, my starting weight was 110kgs and my current weight is 63kgs. My ideal goal weight is 55kgs.

I lost weight at first by eating less and exercising more. I still ate a lot of junk food (sugar is my weakness) but I ate less of it and started cycling around 20km a day and the weight came off pretty consistently. After about six months of this I started CrossFit and absolutely loved it, my weight didn't budge for the first month of doing it but I was patient and eventually it started dropping again. I also cleaned up my diet a bit and I now eat a lot less junk food. I had to stop doing CrossFit at the beginning of December 2019 because my work hours meant I could no longer make it to classes so I have now joined a gym close to my house.

I talked to a personal trainer, got a training program written for me and the plan is to do my program twice a week (Tuesday and Thursday-it takes about an hour and is mostly strength training focused on toning up my muscle groups which are lacking tone aka abs, butt and upper thighs) and then attend three group fitness classes a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday-these are 45 mins long and are HIIT based) and one pilates class on a Saturday morning, then rest on Sunday. I do all of my workouts in the morning, go to work for the day, and then walk home (which is about 8km) so I think I will be getting plenty of exercise. I started this last week and so far I'm feeling okay, I just get really hungry after working out in the morning lol but I'm still tracking my calories and staying within my limits.

I have adjusted my calorie intake as I've lost weight because I'm nearly half the size I used to be so obviously I don't need quite as much food to function anymore. It is also worth mentioning that I have PCOS, although it is well controlled now with metformin and spironolactone.

I know my current weight is already in a healthy range, but I retain a lot of fat around my stomach (partly genetics, partly PCOS related) and I need to get to the lower end of a healthy weight in order to look how I want.

Has anyone had a similar experience of trying to get toned and lose the last bit of weight after starting at a much higher weight? How long did it take you to make that last little bit of progress? Also did you end up with much lose skin? I have been lucky so far (I think being young and strength training helps though) and I don't have a lot of loose skin, just a bit on my upper arms, but I'm afraid that once the stomach fat reduces I will be left with a lot of loose skin in that area.

dm68s9,xxfitness,How do you get back into fitness after being struck by life's chaos?,"I'm 20 years old, and currently in my fall quarter junior year of college. About 5 weeks ago, my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer, and then we found out he also had liver cancer and that it's stage 4. My boyfriend of almost 2 years had to transfer from my college to another one, leaving me without my main support system, and to top it off, the distance broke us apart and as of today we are separated.

Five weeks ago before all this happened, I was on top of my fitness game. I was tracking my macros and making consistent progress. I enjoyed every sweat-sesh, and I found a lot of joy in my routine. I was lean and maintaining that weight, and I enjoyed eating healthy meals and took pride in my fitness. 

The past five weeks, I've completely let myself go. I've stopped tracking my food and now I eat things I previously would have never eaten, like lots of junk food and chips. The bad news with my dad and the fighting with my boyfriend threw my hunger cues off, because sometimes I would be so upset I couldn't physically eat, and then I would get super hungry and eat everything. 

Not only do I feel like an emotional wreck with all these things going on in my personal life, I now feel physically sick because of the changes that have happened in my body. I've gained weight, lost confidence, lost motivation, and lost my sense of well-being. 

I know I can't be the only person who has gotten thrown off their A-game with fitness when life gets rough. I just want to know if anyone else who's gone through something similar has been able to get back into fitness, and what tips you might have for me. I want to use fitness to help myself mentally and emotionally get through this, I'm just in a rut and I don't know how to get back in to it all.

For those who don‚Äôt know, Spartan Race is an obstacle course race (OCR) and they do 3 main distances (3 mile/20 obstacles,8 mile/25 obstacles,13 mile /30 obstacles) to earn a trifecta , you must do a race of each distance in one calendar year. Something which separates Spartan from the other OCR formats is that for each failed obstacle you have to do 30 burpees. 

In about Late January , I had a small identity crisis after lifting for about 18 months , because I felt like it was all pointless and I wanted to do some sort of athletic pursuit. There‚Äôs no way I can lift enough for powerlifting , tanning freaks me out so bodybuilding was out, and I suck at team sports. I fell upon Spartan race. So , because I like to do things the hard way (ummm... challenge myself ) I signed up for not one but 3 races , with the third (13 mile) at what‚Äôs considered one of the (if not the ) most challenging venue of them all. Ooof. Let me tell you I had no idea what I was in for. I‚Äôm not gonna go into TOO much detail about my first 2 because I already did full race reports on those. 

TRAINING 
Leading up to my first race (the sprint , 3 miles) , I pursued online training. I was essentially running 20 miles /week spread out on 3 days. And doing squat ,bench /ohp ,deadlift on the others. I had to take 3 weeks of training off at one point due to injury. This race was in May and the obstacles were great ! But I gassed myself due to not training hills enough and only running on the treadmill. For my second race (Super , 8 miles), I dropped the online training and switched to PHAT + cardio (not enough ). The added chest , tricep, and calf work made a HUGE difference , which made hills and burpees easier. These things are absolute game changers in spartan race.  I continued with this a bit to train for my beast (13 mile), but I went through a bit of a busy patch academically and my depression flared up a lot ... id estimate that I got a grand total of 6 workouts in in the 6 weeks between those races. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Please note that I have a physical job which involves picking up heavy objects and I was also taking a summer class that was literally on a mountain that I‚Äôd have to walk up , so I wasn‚Äôt totally sedentary during this period. When I did hit the gym, I was doing sandbag carry, farmers carry , dead hangs , pull-ups (assisted) and hill training on treadmill incline / stair master. 

I really recommend training for carry obstacles because the familiar movement will be really easy on race day, and I would just be able to close my eyes and pretend I was in the gym. 

NUTRITION 
So I didn‚Äôt really modify my nutrition much , I eat pretty much like any normal college student ? I don‚Äôt eat very much processed food except some junk food (like anyone else , but my main meals are usually based on whole foods). I rarely drink (maybe once every 2 months ) but when I do I get absolutely sloshed. For race day nutrition though! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important here. 2 days of carb loading before each race. 4 days of drinking so much water I pretty much constantly have to pee.  For the sprint , I brought 2 packs (1 pack= 2 servings , take one 5 mins before then every45 mins ) of cliff bloks (they look like candy in a long package , not the protein bars). For my super , I had 2 packs + 2 packs of gu energy gel. Energy gel comes in flavours and is this liquid syrupy thing. It is very difficult to choke down for me (I straight up gag) , but it works and apparently metabolizes better/faster cause it‚Äôs liquid. This could be bullshit , but I haven‚Äôt passed out at a race yet so I‚Äôm gonna keep at it. I also had one pack of gu hydration mix which has BCAAs, carbs , and caffeine inside of my hydration pack (more on this later). For the beast, I stuck to similar to the super but just more. 4 packs of blocks. 11 energy gels. 2 packs of hydration mix in my water. I had my watch on so I made sure to fuel up every 40 minutes like clockwork no matter what we were doing. 


GEAR
For my first race , it was approximately 6 degrees Celsius and the mountain was covered in snow ! In May! So I wore under armour cold gear leggings , trail running socks , and an underarmour cold gear top.  I was hot but it was important to protect myself against hypothermia. I also wore Salomon speedcross 4 (these are trail running shoes ). 

For my super (8mile) , it was about 10-15 Celsius and... a thunder storm. I wish that was a joke. I wore my finisher T-shirt from the previous race (dryfit material) , Nike running shorts , lululemon energy bra , and lululemon underwear (important to have 0 COTTON IF POSSIBLE because you‚Äôre gonna get wet and muddy and cotton gets heavy). I also had a camelback (I think it‚Äôs the aurora ) with an 80oz bladder. I wore pretty much the same for my final race except I wore the finisher tee from my super ! 

If you take anything away from this : cotton is the devil, and for the love of god get yourself some trail shoes. I saw lots of people in regular shoes absolutely sliding down the muddy downhills. 

THE RACE - 13 mile Beast in Killington, VT
So the part we‚Äôve all been waiting for. Driving up , we saw signs from nearby businesses that said ‚Äúwelcome to the beast, good luck Spartans !‚Äù And my stomach started to churn. It was real now. This was the only race that I wasn‚Äôt 100% confident in finishing. So. We get to the start line , I had registered for 9:45 am but got a 10 am start time (the goal here , especially in longer races , is to get as early as possible so you get more time on course ). The course had 3 cutoffs : specific places you had to be by 6 and 7, and then the finish line at 9. It started off great , I even almost got over the wall without help! (In the open division you can help each other , but not age group /elite) then after the dunk wall (where you dunk in muddy water to pass a wall from underneath) , there was the slip wall. It‚Äôs basically about 10ft tall, slanted , and has a rope going halfway down. The other side is more like a ladder to get down. Well, I got to the top and then partially because of it being muddy , and also because I didn‚Äôt work on it enough, my grip failed and I slid all the way down. All of my limbs and my stomach were bleeding. This lead fear to take over for a lot of obstacles involving heights and so I burpee‚Äôd out of way more than what would have otherwise been necessary. Adrenaline mostly took care of the pain. I honestly found the first 4 miles to be pretty easy , then the real hills started. We hit the 6 pm checkpoint at 3:30 so I was feeling confident. Then we got to the death march. It‚Äôs 1.2 miles straight up a double black diamond. Towards the top, you could barely see through the fog. I had to stop every 50 feet or so because my hip flexors were in so much pain. I‚Äôve never pushed through so much pain before , seriously. But we made it to the top by 4:45. At this point every burpee caused me immense pain in just the action of lowering myself. Then there was another climb but it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad. On the downhill , I found out there was ANOTHER uphill and that it was nasty. By the time we hit that one , we had 90 minutes before the cutoff. I was starting to worry (very serious concern) and someone told me that if I just kept moving I would be fine. If you looked out behind, you could see all the people on the death march still that would evidently not make it. For some reason , that gave me one last push. There were a few obstacles on the downhill , then we got to one last small climb that was the sandbag carry but had been cancelled (you still had to walk the path though) because it was too dangerous in the dark. Then the last few obstacles. You could see the finish. I failed the spear throw , which wasn‚Äôt shocking considering my muscles tapped out so much that I could barely lift the spear. Then the last two obstacles , I got one , and I fell off of the rig (which I only tried cause the photographer was there , I knew I couldn‚Äôt get it ). After those final burpees , we crossed the fire (finish line ) with exactly 42 minutes left to finish. 

My final mileage was about 7000ft elevation, and around 16 miles. 

So obviously I could have done better had I been more consistent with training , but I‚Äôm truly proud of myself after 8 months of preparation. Next year I want to do even more races and I couldn‚Äôt be more excited ! If you even have a passing thought where you think you‚Äôd want to do one of these - do it, you won‚Äôt regret it for a second.",2019-09-17 16:53:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/d5jqfm/race_reportish_going_from_a_casual_gym_goer_to/
d3d2k6,xxfitness,Decreased body fat but waist measurement increased?,"Hi guys, I recently had a second body scan (one of those scans that give you your body composition and measurement stats). I've was stoked to see that I had almost 2% body fat, but I also noticed that some of my measurements had increased. For example, my waist had gone up by 3cm (!!) and each of my thighs had increased by 2.4cm.

In terms of workouts, I do strength straining 3-4x per week and LISS 5x per week, and have recently incorporated HIIT 2-3 x per week as well. In terms of diet, I would classify it as balanced. I tend to avoid junk food like chips, cake, fast food, and I generally only drink alcohol on weekends.

Does anyone know why this might be? If I'm losing body fat, shouldn't I be getting more lean? Or could I have just been bloated or something that particular day?

Edit: The scan was a 3D body scan by Fit3D.",2019-09-12 19:32:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/d3d2k6/decreased_body_fat_but_waist_measurement_increased/
csspp3,xxfitness,Weird body image problem,"30 year old woman here, 5' 5"" and 165 pounds. I let a sedentary life take over until I started working out regularly last year. It's been a struggle but finally this year I've been able to run a 10k at a fully average speed (75 minutes), a massive improvement from 2 hours of walking when I first started. I also feel a lot stronger and can actually push myself in workouts. My weight hasn't changed but I didn't expect it to because I had a lot of fluff to start with. Basically I feel leaner and better, which was the goal.

I didn't make too many changes to my diet because one goal at a time (and I wasn't eating junk food every day or anything too unhealthy)

The problem is that I took some progress pics and they don't show any difference! (Can't post them to show you because too many identifiers in the photos) I know that feeling stronger is my goal and it shouldn't matter if I lose pounds or not (especially when I didn't drastically change my eating habits either). But... is this something I should be worried about? Cos I feel great and beautiful, and when I look in my mirror I see the changes, but someone takes a photo of me and I'm back to looking like pre-workout me. What is happening?? Is this some weird reverse dysmorphia?",2019-08-20 04:31:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/csspp3/weird_body_image_problem/
c9m6pw,xxfitness,Tips for Combating Belly Rolls when Sitting for 'Skinny' F23?,"Sorry if I'm asking this in the wrong place! I'm 23F,  55kg/ 121lb and 5ft 7, so healthy enough and quite I look quite slender when clothed/ covered up. But I'm very self conscious about the fat rolls that start below my bra whenever I sit down. Will cardio help? I have an exercise bike which I use about 30 mins a week followed by 15 mins of ab work out on the mat. And I'm trying to regulate my diet as well (was never a big junk food eater anyway and I mainly just drink water. Alcohol and pasta and my main vices though). 

Can fat rolls when sitting be helped? I'm aware that everyone gets them, but I'd just liked them eased a bit before I go on holidays and will have to wear bikinis, crop tops etc. I (probably unjustifiably) find it particularly annoying and upsetting as I'm a girl who doesn't have womanly curves any place else. 

So whilst the stomach probably is the hardest place to get fit, does anyone have any tips or if anyone thinks that 30 mins a day on the bike will help at all? And I'd rather not go to the gym, particularly because I have an exercise bike at home which I quite like - or am I just setting myself up for a loss here by not going to the gym? 

Thanks to anyone who read this far!!

P.S - looks like this is getting downvoted so I'm sorry if this comes across as rude/ uneducated/ self-pitying. It's been something I've been self conscious over for a long time and I'm finally ready to get off my lazy ass and exercise to improve it, but I need help.

c8pz15,xxfitness,"My eating habits are great at work, not so much at home","&#x200B;

I have a great workout routine, I've gone from someone who never worked out (except forced gym class in high school) to working out 5-6 days a week, competed in 2 power-lifting events and have arms that draw looks from the dudes at my gym. I have a very structured workout routine and have no problem waking up early to work out before going to the office. 

I eat very healthy (mostly plants, high protein, low processed carbs, only drink alcohol on special occasions) but I still eat too much. On days when I'm at the office my eating is on point. I don't snack, I just eat the food I bring and I'm never tempted by treats people bring in. It's actually impressive how I can turn down absolutely any fresh baked goods, pizza or donuts without feeling I'm depriving myself. When I get home I cook a huge vegetable heavy meal so I feel full and keep my calories in check. 

But on the weekend it all goes to shit. I don't understand it. Last year I worked from home and I also had this problem. I am not snacking on junk all day, but any time I get a tiny hunger pang it's so hard to ignore it. When I'm at work I find it very easy to ignore. On weekends I'm not sitting watching netflix. I have lots of personal projects I'm working on, it's almost like an office day. I usually hit the gym one day on the weekend and will visit friends, go for walks, shopping etc. But I still over eat. 

I have suffered depression for a long time, and I used to emotionally eat. But I don‚Äôt think this is it. It‚Äôs more like, I can‚Äôt get my mind off food when I‚Äôm at home. At the office I can put off my next meal longer by playing mental games (‚Äújust wait till 1pm to eat lunch‚Äù ‚Äúwait till after the meeting to eat your cucumber‚Äù) at home those games just don‚Äôt work. 

Its death by a thousand cuts on the weekend as I keep grabbing rice cakes with PB2, oatmeal with protein powder or bowls of frozen berries with PB2 sprinkled on them. I can eat my daily calories too early and then I'm dying for food at night. I'm not eating junk food but I'm over-eating healthy food. I don't even keep snacks in the house because I know on the weekend I'll give in. 

At one point I was a runner, I did 10k every day and even ran 2 half marathons. When I was running a lot I was able to fast all day and only eat one big meal at night. Now that I do almost exclusively weights (with a bit of cardio here and there) I get STARVING. But I also eat when I‚Äôm not hungry. It‚Äôs like... the need for food takes over my brain until I can‚Äôt think of anything else. This doesn‚Äôt happen when I‚Äôm at the office, when I‚Äôm out with friends or even if I‚Äôm shopping alone. It happens when I‚Äôm home alone. 

Does anyone else have this problem? I'm not overweight, in fact I just did a body fat test at my gym and I‚Äôm at 25% which apparently is average. But I workout soooo much and I have a lot of muscle, so it's really depressing that I can‚Äôt lean out a bit a show my muscles off. My arms show my muscles more because I gain fat in my thighs and butt first. I know a big part of this is mental, because obviously I have will power some of the time. I just don‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt have it all of the time.",2019-07-03 16:12:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/c8pz15/my_eating_habits_are_great_at_work_not_so_much_at/
c6szdo,xxfitness,Ladies with a lot to lose/who have lost a lot!,"Hi ladies of xxfitness! Long time lurker here, first time poster. A little backstory.... I was always the ‚Äòtiny‚Äô friend in high school. I played sports, worked out a few times a week and was pretty healthy. Moved to a new city, moved in with my boyfriend, and started college in late 2015. I didn‚Äôt have dinner ready every night anymore (shoutout to mom and dad for keeping me well fed!), and mac and cheese or McDonald‚Äôs became an acceptable dinner. Between my laziness, my boyfriends laziness, easy junk food at the college and a bit of depression in there - 4 years later, I‚Äôm 100lbs heavier than I was in high school. 

I remember every time I hit a ‚Äòlandmark‚Äô weight - 150, 175, 200, 225, and now 240... I would try to talk myself into getting my sh*t together (it obviously never worked..). I am now finally at the point where I know for my health, I really need to get it together and lose the weight once and for all. 

How have you ladies who have lost 75+ pounds stayed motivated and got it done? I can‚Äôt get out of my head and past the whole ‚ÄòI‚Äôve wrecked my body and the damage is done‚Äô mindset. I know my health is more important, but it‚Äôs hard to get started when I have so far to go.

During that time I looked up that I needed about 1500cal a day to maintain because I'm pretty short and sedentary. But I ended up losing a lot of weight and I haven't had my period since February.

Do you have to force yourself to eat when you're not hungry, are you constantly full, do you need to sneak more calorie rich snacks like nuts throughout the day even though youre not hungry and don't want to eat, etc?

Is there such a thing as 'intuitive bulking'?

I don't mind tracking my weight, but I really have no desire to track food or calories.  I've been trying to eat more than normal, but I think  all that happened was i crave junk food less and thus eat cleaner while still maintaining the same weight.

I hope this is helpful!

**Cliff Notes Version** 

* address your diet and look for three things: alcohol consumption, junk food and snacks within the house (also make note if you have been excessively snacking), and takeout/eating out. Make a list of all these things for the week to get an idea of diet errors that are correctable. 
* Follow up by purging your house of unhealthy foods and don't buy more. 
* Figure out ways of increasing your protein, aiming for 1gram/lb of lean body weight. 
* Make your grocery list and make sure your meals. 
* Stay on top of your workout routines - make sure your sessions are intense, rest periods aren't too long, and you're using intensity techniques in your routine. 
* Add in your cardio - suggested 2 times per week.",2019-05-22 03:00:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/brjkkh/how_to_start_your_fitness_journey_great_video_for/
brakwr,xxfitness,I‚Äôm losing weight because of cutting calories and cardios/HIITs yet still flabby. Should I switch to bulking and weightlifting?,"Hi! I‚Äôm a 21-year old female who wants to be fit, strong and healthy. I want to change my unhealthy lifestyle so it can benefit me in the long run like preventing back/muscle injuries, becoming lean and stronger. I‚Äôve always been a skinny kid during highschool. I was fit, flexible and healthy as I was practicing martial arts that time. I weighed around 43 kg (94.8 lbs) that time. On my senior year in college, I started gaining more weight because of all the stress at college and clinical rotations (no exercise, stress eating, fast food, lack of sleep). My weight reached 57 kg (125.6 lbs) due to that.

Lately, I‚Äôve been doing cardio workouts for the past few months at least 2-3x a week (Skipping ropes, stair running, jogging, treadmill running, following cardio and HIIT workouts on Youtube). I‚Äôve also cut rice, pork, junk foods, oily and fatty foods from my diet. My usual meals include: lemon-cucumber water, oolong tea, oatmeal, milk, chicken, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits. I‚Äôm allergic to seafoods, btw. I‚Äôve cut on my sodium intake to prevent bloatedness as well. I am currently weighing 52 kg (114.6 lbs).

However, I‚Äôm still packed with unwanted fats ‚Äî face fat, double chin, belly rolls, back fat, armpit fat, flabby arms and thighs. It‚Äôs been affecting my self-esteem as people would comment on my flabby figure and I can‚Äôt seem to wear whatever I want. I rely on makeup contouring as well. What I‚Äôm doing right now with cardio workouts and diet is not enough. When I gain weight, I gain booty and hips and all the other places where gain is unwanted. When I lose weight, I lose booty and boobs (my boobs are already small-averageish). I just really want to trim my tummy, waist, double chin, arms, and thighs yet still maintain/grow wider hips and a nice butt. Do you also have any ideas on what can I do to grow my boobs (if there‚Äôs any natural way)? I would also like to get rid of my obvious hip dips and cellulites on my thighs and bum.

Should I switch to bulking and weightlifting? Which home workouts can you recommend? 

I‚Äôm currently unemployed so I can‚Äôt afford protein shakes, gym memberships and a trainer just yet. I also live in a small condominium unit so my space is also limited.  I own a waist trimmer belt, skipping rope, a pair of 1kg ankle weights and a yoga mat.

bjgqrs,xxfitness,What are your favourite healthy substitutes for your favourite junk foods? I'll share mine to start!,"Years ago I used to regularly eat chips, burgers, entire blocks of chocolate for desert, entire packets of biscuits etc...

&#x200B;

I still get cravings for all of those things, but I've slowly found replacements that are healthy (or not as unhealthy) - would be interested to see what you do too!

&#x200B;

The hardest things for me are convenience foods - when I do a 13/14 hour shift and have no food ready to go in the fridge, I am more likely to go through a macdonalds drivethrough than cook something from scratch...

&#x200B;

* Soft drink > Berocca or electrolyte tabs in water
* Iced tea > A dash of cordial in water (maybe not healthy, but much less sugar!)
* Ice cream > protein powder blended with ice, or greek yoghurt with topping
* Milkshake > protein shake
* Chocolate > dark chocolate
* Snickers > prunes and almonds
* Mars bar > banana with peanut butter
* Tart/sour candy > pineapple, citrus, strawberries
* Sweet candy > grapes, pears, nectarines, plums
* Salt and vinegar chips > salt and vinegar flavoured rice crackers (might add tuna to make it more filling)
* Hot chips > roast potatoes
* Big greasy burger > spagetti bolognese

&#x200B;

Things I haven't found a good replacement for (suggestions welcome!), but either avoid eating or have on occasion:

&#x200B;

* Biscuits to dip in hot cups of tea
* Fruit-flavoured Mentos - something about the texture means fruit doesn't quite satisfy the craving
* Meals when I'm pressed for time (so a replacement for MacDonalds, Hungry Jacks, KFC etc)
* Coffee
* Red wine",2019-05-01 12:54:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/bjgqrs/what_are_your_favourite_healthy_substitutes_for/

bh1muf,xxfitness,Just binged probably 4000+ calories. What just happened and what to do next?,"I've been working out hard and eating intuitively for recomp purposes for about 10 weeks now. It has been going really well. I have gained maybe one or two pounds, which I consider to be within my recomp goals, and have put on strength and visible muscle while still having enough energy for lifting and my other active hobbies (climbing and hiking). I needed a deload week not too long ago because I started climbing more often and pushed my body a little overboard. since I've been back I have been stronger and feeling like I'm making great progress towards my goals. I don't keep junk food in the house because I would rather exercise will power in the grocery store than at home, and binging isn't a typical thing for me.

I don't track calories or macros but I aim for over 100 g of protein a day and feel like I hit or exceed that most days. I'm 5'9 and ~137lbs. I get at least 7 hours of sleep every night, usually closer to 8.

Today I woke up feeling pretty beat up from a hard workout yesterday with more workouts and climbing in days prior, and having spent two days painting and working in my new house which tweaked my shoulder a little. My head space was all kinds of terrible and I spent most of my time being irritable and not getting a lot done. And I ate CONSTANTLY. it felt like it was impossible to feel full. I still don't have a fully functional kitchen so I am mostly ""snacking"" though I try to keep it healthy, but there is more processed stuff in there than I usually like. The day started well with muesli, fruit and pb. After that it was chaos, protein bar after protein bar, mom left a box of some junk food crackers which I crushed (1000+ kcal), with a tub of hummus, and almost a whole bag of trader Joe's trail mix (1000 kcal), lots of fruit, some beet juice, a beer. A lot of the stuff was very calorie dense so I know I went way over my typical calorie balance.

I'm not stressing too hard about it because I know one day won't throw my whole program off... But I guess what I'm wondering is, did I just really need all those calories or was it a mistake? Was this mostly a stress response (my life is crazy right now)? Will I be less hungry tomorrow? Should I do anything about this now or just try to forget it ever happened?",2019-04-24 23:35:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/bh1muf/just_binged_probably_4000_calories_what_just/

**About Me**

This is my 3rd DEXA but the first one was on a different machine. For my first scan in June 2017 I was underweight at 103 lbs 21.4% body fat and had low bone density with -2.2 Z-score. I started lifting after that scan and have been aiming to gain lean mass since then and I'm most glad about my bone density increasing to the normal range.

In high school I participated in cross country and track but I was never good. I had always been thin and lost a bit of weight in college. I got more into fitness because I wanted to put on healthy weight. I started with powerlifting and I guess I've been bodybuilding recently. I was consistent with powerlifting for about 6 months and then I was having personal struggles and lost progress and gained some fat. 

**Current Diet**

I've been eating intuitively. My diet could be better but I think it's okay. Lunch varies because I eat fast food like 3 times a week for lunch. I eat treats when I want basically, but I don't think I eat too much junk food. I really like fruit and cereal for breakfast. I try to eat mostly whole grains and I have a good amount of protein at dinner through fish or steak with vegetables usually. Last time I was tracking calories my maintenance was about 2000 kcal a day. I've been aiming to eat a surplus but it's been a very slow gain lately so I was likely eating around 2000-2100 kcal.

**Current Routine**

For the past 5 months I've been at Planet Fitness so my equipment is limited. I enjoyed Candito's 6-week program when I was powerlifting so I just do a few of these accessories a day (leg curl, leg extension, bulgarian split squat, glute machine, hip abductor, hip adductor, close grip bench, bicep curls, tricep pulldown, dumbbell fly's) and keep doing the first 2 weeks as a 4x a week upper lower split. I've been using the smith machine to squat, bench and straight leg deadlift. Lat pulldown, machine row, and millitary press are the other lifts I chose to do with the program. The weights I use haven't changed much. I've just been trying to do a lot of volume.

**Going Forward**

It's nice to see my workouts have improved my body composition. But my priorities have changed. I wanted to see how much I progressed before I switch my routine around. Because I have signed up for the Navy and want to do well at bootcamp I'll be running more, swimming and doing pushups more instead of lifting. I want to do full body lifting 2x a week. And just try to eat to maintain my weight. I started C25K in January but was only doing it 2x a week so I'm just going to do that more. And I've been doing this pushups program I found online 2x a week and will increase that.

I noticed from my scan that I need to build up my abs the most. I thought that before as well but the 1 or 2 bodyweight exercises I was doing at the end of my workouts was not enough. I'd like any ab building recommendations.",2019-02-02 23:41:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/amjw9o/dexa_scan_24_54_1145_lbs_224_5_month_progress/

I‚Äôve been naturally thin my whole life, so I never worked out. I know that being thin doesn‚Äôt equate to being healthy, so I‚Äôm at the point where I really want to focus on building healthy habits. Plus, I‚Äôve never been strong, so I‚Äôm excited about that possibility.

I‚Äôve been going to the gym about 3 weeks now. I do 20 mins of cardio (elliptical on max incline or stairmaster, keeping in my ideal heart rate range). Then I‚Äôve just been using machines, either legs or upper body (alternating). I know machines aren‚Äôt ideal; I‚Äôd love to work up to free weights someday. But right now I‚Äôm still getting comfortable in the gym and focusing on building some base strength. 

I feel great physically, but I‚Äôm struggling with the diet side of it. I‚Äôm trying to eat in a slight caloric surplus but it is HARD to eat that much in a day because I‚Äôm gluten and (mostly) dairy free. I meal prep and eat pretty clean (a lot of unprocessed foods, almost never fast food). I supplement a lot with protein shakes... or protein powder mixed into anything haha.

TL;DR Will it be hard for me to gain muscle eating on a gluten+dairy free diet? (Anyone else on here doing that?) Would I gain muscle faster if I were eating less clean/more junk food?

agu1aw,xxfitness,When was the last time you thought about how incredible your body is?,"If you're like me, you spend a lot of time trying to get to your next destination. Whether it is lifting X lbs, running X miles, losing X pounds, or any of the other innumerable goals represented by the women in this sub, we are all working to be better, stronger, and healthier. Which is great!

BUT...Have you spent any time lately acknowledging how bada\*\* your body is the way it is right now?

When it comes down to it, I can be kind of mean to my body. I focus on its flaws--how it isn't performing the way I want it to or looking the way I want to. I feed it junk food more often than I should, I don't stretch or roll out as much as I should, I don't give it as much rest as it needs. I expect it to go from sedentary to active with just a short warm up. I place an incredible number of demands and expectations on my body.

And when I take a step back, I start to realize that despite how mean I can be to my body, it comes through for me over and over again. It's kind of absurd how marvelous my body is. It has taken me to places that can be accessed only by foot, with 35 lbs of gear on my back. It has held babies and barbells. It has grounded me in times of fear and uncertainty. It has gotten me through the flu, mono, chicken pox, and who knows how many cold viruses. It has comforted loved ones and allowed me to experience deep intimacy with another person. It is always working to operate at its peak for me, no matter how I treat it. That's kind of amazing!

I‚Äôm talking about people like Donald Trump, John Mcafee, the Rock, etc. in the celebrity realm. And even my Uncle

My Uncle smokes 20 cigarettes a day, drinks probably 250 ml whiskey daily, and he has been doing it for 40 years. He sleeps only for like 5 hours. He‚Äôs now 60, and he has remarkable energy levels. He‚Äôs active for like 16-18 hours a day, no joke. Also I‚Äôve literally never seen him fall sick. Not even once. All he eats is junk food 

Mcafee has said during his days building the antivirus software, he would go days without sleep. He did so even during his 70s, RIP

Trump, who is almost 80 years old, apparently never exercises, sleeps only 3-4 hours a day on average, never drinks water, 12 diet cokes a day, highly processed food diet. All of this has been confirmed by Dana White, and many others. Sometimes he doesn‚Äôt sleep for 2-3 days even. Even his medical records are immaculate. Though he has said he‚Äôs never smoked or had alcohol.

Despite all this, he seems to have an amazing level of energy, to get everything done.
 

Is it possible to learn this power? 

Edit:

This post is turning into a Trump hate page, which is completely unfair.

His health, energy levels, and such deserve obvious respect, even more so because he has the most stressful job in the entire world.

Trump has explicitly stated many times that he‚Äôs never done drugs, alcohol, or even smoked a cigarette. This is well documented and has been confirmed by many sources on numerous occasions.

He lost his elder brother due to addiction, and therefore respected his advice of zero intoxicants.
The point of this post is biohacking discussion, not personal attacks and defamation. That too against serious family trauma.

Disgusting, shame on the people who‚Äôre promoting this fake narrative.

Even if you‚Äôre blessed enough to never have lost a loved one, you should know how it feels, and the fact that the promises such made are non negotiably set in stone. 

Being sober for your entire life definitely deserves respect, very few people have that level of self control. No wonder he‚Äôs much healthier than 99.99% of the people his age.

Kindly refrain from obvious personal attacks and focus on the good, like his health for his age.

day  1 im at work and i notice my mood is just better a couple hours in and im able to think clearer and faster. 

day 2 same benefits but more so

day 3 i ate some really processed junk food from a hot chicken spot and immedielty noticed a decline shortly after and woke up with almosty a hangover. i mention this because i had ate from this spt before and never noticed much of a shift from baseline so that kind of indicates to me that because my baseline is now better, this sort of thing becomes more noticeable.

Your body naturally detoxifies every day through the liver, kidneys, gut, skin, and lungs. But certain habits or issues can *slow this process down*‚Äîsometimes without you even realizing it.

* **Nutrient Deficiency:** Vitamins and minerals are key for detox. If you‚Äôre low on nutrients like zinc or magnesium, your body can't flush out waste efficiently.
* **Liver & Kidney Health Issues:** These two organs do most of the detox work. When they‚Äôre not functioning well, toxins can build up in your body.
* **High Sugar & Processed Foods:** Junk food adds more toxins and burdens the liver. It also causes inflammation, which makes natural detox harder.
* **Poor Sleep:** Your body cleans up and recovers while you sleep. Skipping rest = slower repair and detox processes.

1knw49e,Biohackers,"Is this the Ultimate Bio hack using DNA testing, Genetic Reports and LLM's?","So in short.

Got my DNA test through Ancestry.

Uploaded the data into Genetic Genie at first. Got insights.

Then found Genetic Life Hacks, paid for a monthly subscription, downloaded all the reports in one click. 119 pages.

Then fed it into Claude, chat gpt and chat gpt deep research. (The deep research took ages, but it produced a very in-depth report I can understand based on my results)

And then prompted all 3 to highlight the red flags and green flags.

Then I went down the red flag list 1 by 1 creating a supplement plan along the way.

I did this multiple times across multiple GPTS as a stop gap to get the most accurate information.

I then went and spoke to naturopaths at my local health food store confirming my findings and cross referencing the AI's feedback with their personal experience.

So far its been very effective.

These are my red flags -

# üö© Red Flags Affecting Energy, Focus, and Productivity

# 1. COMT Met/Met (rs4680 A/A) ‚Äì Low COMT enzyme activity

* **What it does:** Slower breakdown of dopamine, adrenaline, and norepinephrine.
* **Why it matters:** Can cause **mental fatigue**, overwhelm, **sensitivity to stress**, and difficulty focusing under pressure. Often leads to mental overactivity or racing thoughts, especially in high-stimulus environments.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Wired-but-tired feeling, overstimulation, anxious procrastination, mental crash after stress.

# 2. MAOA High-Activity (rs6323 G/G) ‚Äì Faster serotonin & dopamine breakdown

* **What it does:** Reduces levels of calming neurotransmitters like serotonin more quickly.
* **Why it matters:** Can lead to **lower baseline mood**, **less resilience to stress**, and a higher likelihood of fatigue or burnout in high-demand environments.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Flat mood, irritability, low motivation, sensitivity to sleep loss.

# 3. SOD2 Ala/Ala (rs4880 A/A) ‚Äì Weaker mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme

* **What it does:** Reduces your ability to clear mitochondrial oxidative stress.
* **Why it matters:** Leads to **less efficient cellular energy production**, and **faster mitochondrial fatigue**, especially under stress, high training loads, or poor sleep.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Physical tiredness, sluggishness, headaches, or fatigue that hits earlier in the day than it should.

# 4. GSTM1 Null (gene deleted) ‚Äì Reduced detox capacity

* **What it does:** Limits your ability to detox free radicals and chemical byproducts.
* **Why it matters:** If exposed to toxins, pollution, poor diet, or stress, you‚Äôll accumulate oxidative stress **faster**, which wears down energy and mental clarity.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Brain fog, slower recovery, fatigue after alcohol or junk food, sluggish mornings.

# 5. MTHFR A1298C Homozygous (rs1801131 G/G) ‚Äì Mild methylation bottleneck

* **What it does:** Slightly reduces conversion of folate to its active form.
* **Why it matters:** May cause **lower neurotransmitter and energy molecule production**, especially if B2, B6, folate, or B12 are suboptimal.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Low mental energy, slow mental start in the morning, difficulty focusing, more tired on low-carb or low-protein diets.

# 6. FMO3 Variants + BHMT Heterozygous ‚Äì Choline and methylation backup pathway compromise

* **What it does:** Reduces efficiency of homocysteine recycling and choline metabolism.
* **Why it matters:** Choline is needed for acetylcholine (key for focus), methylation (energy + detox), and liver function. Low choline = low productivity.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Afternoon slumps, foggy thinking, or mental fatigue with low-protein intake or skipping eggs/meat.

# 7. DAO Variants (rs10156191 + rs2052129) ‚Äì Histamine intolerance

* **What it does:** Slows breakdown of dietary histamine.
* **Why it matters:** **High histamine = brain fog, anxiety, disrupted sleep**, and even energy crashes after eating high-histamine foods (wine, cheese, aged meat, leftovers).
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Energy swings, headaches, irritability after meals, trouble winding down at night.

Supplements I have started taking and will be adding to my existing stack:

# ‚úÖ Suggested Integration Plan (No Overlap, Best Timing)

I am still in the process of ordering and being shipped a few supps.

A major AHA moment came today with this little gem:

DRD2 A1 allele (reduced dopamine receptor density) Your reward system might not feel the ‚Äúhit‚Äù from slow progress ‚Äî you need stronger stimuli or more novelty to stay engaged. This makes you crave the start of something new, but disengage when the grind starts. So I should take this?

Uridine Monophosphate (150‚Äì300mg) ‚Üí Supports dopamine receptor density (especially helpful with your DRD2 A1) ‚Üí Great for long-term mood and drive stability

I am getting Uridine next week and combined with choline and fish oil and I cant wait to see what happens.

\------------------------------------------------

This week though ive added in Herbs of gold Stress Ease and Liver Care, COq10 and NAC.

And I've felt the best i have in years. I think a lot of my trouble was clearing away the toxins and also supporting my slow COMT gene with adaptogens like rhodiola and Ashwaghanda (which is in Stress Ease)

I am more focus, clear headed, less time chronically tired and overall feel much lighter already and I have only just started.

**TL;DR**¬†

Using my DNA, Genetic health reports and LLMS I built a personalized supplement stack and I am already seeing fantastic results within the first week of trying it.

1k1vuzt,Biohackers,A theory on the causes of obesity and overreating.,"There is no denying that rates of obesity have significantly increased in the past few decades. In part I believe it's due to changing dietary habits and easy access and convenience and taste of junk food. Could there be also other factors at work here?


Much of the food now is very calorie dense(rich in processed fats and carbohydrates). At the same it's not very nutrient rich, which is a consequence of highly processed foods, which is why many are fortified and have vitamins added. The quality of the soil that many foods are grown also is deficient in nutrients leading to fresh produce having much less essential minerals like magnesium compared to the same produce decades ago. 

Since the body not only requires adequate caloric intake but also essential nutrients and minerals, could people's overreating be their body compensating and creating hunger in order to have intake of sufficient nutrients and minerals?

Since food is calorie dense, nutrient poor, many will eat an excess amount of calories in order to satisfy their nutritional needs of minerals and vitamins?

So people's hunger to overreat is simply their craving for nutrients, not simply calories?

A way to mitigate this would be to supplement with a multivitamin and pick nutrient rich,  but less calorie dense foods? 

This should help reduce cravings for eating excess calories as one's nutritional needs are being met ?

I'm not a person who sweats a lot, rather a little. I could ride a bike in the summer, in fact I do it to go to work, until now it hadn't been a problem... but my coworker last time told me... ""you're sweating a lot!"" and I had a film of perspiration on my face, arms, etc. (In the past it was not even noticeable)

Here are mine:

‚Äî Green tea. I drink tons of matcha every day for my ADHD, been doing it for past 2 months, but so far no effect on weight loss. Works great for focus and mood however. 

‚Äî Keto. I lost 10 pounds but I love food too much and didn‚Äôt just want to eat meat and fat all the time. Felt deprived so I stopped and gained the weight back.

‚ÄîCalorie counting. Lost 5 pounds. Got frustrated and kept counting wrong, was always hungry and tired, kept trying to cheat, and gave up.

‚ÄîTaking supplements like ALCAR, CLA, berberine, probiotics, inositol. Didn‚Äôt work. Berberine even made me nauseous. Forskolin had promise but it gave me hot flashes and insomnia so I got scared to take anymore. Inositol works for mood but no weight loss so far.

‚ÄîVyvanse, been on it for 2 months, but my appetite has not changed so this hasn‚Äôt done much.

‚ÄîAdderall, this actually worked better for me and killed my cravings but had to stop due to side effects like clenching, anxiety, and insomnia. Made me into a numb robot. Also rebound weight gain when stopping was bad.

‚ÄîWeight lifting, anaerobic exercise. I liked this. I gained muscle but didn‚Äôt diet and still had tons of pudge around my muscles. I just looked thicker, stocky, and not as squishy.

‚ÄîHIIT, I am aerobic exercised intolerant and hated every second of it. I would be in a lot of pain/stress and would go find food after to reward myself. I even had a personal trainer to motivate me every time and I just hated it. It was counter productive.

What definitely worked and was decently enjoyable:

‚ÄîIntermittent fasting. I was fasting 20 hours a day at a time and would even forget to eat. No cravings. Saved a lot of time from trying to find/cook food.

‚ÄîMindlessly eating tons of vegetables before any junk food to pad the junk absorption and increase nutrients. It was good because I still got to eat junk food after (although the vegetables made me full so I only ate half as much).

What works but couldn‚Äôt sustain it due to bad habits or poor time management (classic adhd lol):

1i43k6q,Biohackers,Could energy drinks morning & mid-day (2-5pm) be helping my sleep?,"I've been tracking my sleep for the last 3ish years and have struggled to get even an hour of deep sleep. I usually toss and turn all night and a majority of my sleep is in the light sleep stage.

Over the last year, I started drinking energy drinks in the mornings (Ghost, C4, Reign, Monster, Red Bull), but these last 3 weeks I've also been adding one in the afternoons, as well, totalling to about 300-500mg of caffeine daily.

 Let me just say, for the first time since I began tracking my sleep, I've had nights where my deep sleep has gotten up to just under 2 hours. I've woken up totally refreshed and haven't been waking up more than once during the night, if that. The only thing I've done differently is having the energy drinks mid-day. 

I get up at 4:30 for work, and usually go to bed around 7:30. I also take supplements a couple times a week, but not religiously. Methylated B Complex, Magnesium Glycinate, Vitamin  D & K2, DHA/EPA..  I was taking these before the energy drinks, too, and hadn't noticed much difference in my sleep. 

Also, these drinks have other things in them, besides caffeine. Could this be what's helping to improve my sleep? L-tyrosine, Taurine, Beta-Alanine, etc... as well as the artificial sweeteners (I drink sugar-free, which I know is trash). 

Any insight? I've always avoided junk foods and the like. Been really into supplements and brain health, so the energy drink thing really goes against everything I've come to practice over the years. They give me a mood-boost and an alertness that makes me feel really good. I'll be honest and say I've kind of been using them to self-medicate my depression. I've had my time with anti-depressants over the years, and even though I'd had some improvement with them, ultimately I got off of them because the side effects weren't worth the minimal improvement thar I did get. I have no intention of being reliant on Big-Pharma again. It was a pain in my ass for years. I also have MTHFR gene-mutltation, as well as OCD, and what I feel is undiagnosed ADHD.

1hvt3vw,Biohackers,Any good books on health that are targeted to a teen or young adult reader?,"My oldest children (two daughters) are both in their late teens and have a horrible diet.  They won't eat healthy food I make, but will sneak into the kitchen to make cookies when I'm not there.  They have taken up soda drinking (I never buy or consume sugary beverages, but they always manage to find them).  They will literally eat junk food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  As a result, they are over weight (even though I myself am skinny) and they have ZERO energy.  They have a messy environment and get totally wiped out after asking them to do even a little cleaning.  Like they can't even stand up after 15 minutes of cleaning dishes.  One of my daughters now works for a fast food restaurant and has access to unlimited sugary beverages. 

I've tried explaining things like 1) eating/drinking sugar feeds bad gut bacteria, which in turn, increases appetite, cravings, leaky gut -> metabolic syndrome.  2) eating/drinking sugar strips body of vitamins and minerals leading to fatigue, poor sleep, cavities (they have all of those).  3) junk food is high in vegetable oil which is bad for mood, brain, and heart disease. (They are both depressed as hell.)

1hqg8xu,Biohackers,"Ladies and gents, I need your help. Dad of a young kid, moved to a northern location, stressed out from work. Turnaround solutions under 1000$ a month.","Hello everyone,

I've read about biohacking after reading ""code breaker"". Great book to get to know about CRISPR. Anyway, I'm new to this sub and after reading a bit and seeing the quality of some answers I thought I would ask for some advices.

In short, my wife and I had our first kid 3 years ago. He is great and a joy bringer but his arrival combined with some work and personnal changes crashed my health, energy and fitness level (gained 10kg in a combination of muscle loss and fat gain).

Below is a summary of my last 3 years.

Y1 : working and living in Paris, France (birthplace) and spending Thursday - Sunday in Hamburg, Germany (home country of my wife). Spent an awful amount of time in airports for my own commuting and work related trips. Our kid would wake up 3-4 times a night. No time to exercise. Ended up the year exhausted and with terrible lower back pain. End of the tunnel regarding the commuting to Hamburg as I managed to get my company to accept that I do WFH in Hamburg.

Y2 : The kid still had a full year of bad sleep and us with him. Relocation to Hamburg is nice but long winter without much sun. After a year our kid starts to go to the kindergarten and my wife resumes work. Lots of work, stress eating, often getting sick with need of antibiotics thanks to our kid bringing home each week a range of viruses and bacteria shared by his new friends. Not as bad as Y1 and a new mattress and regular sauna helped reduce the back pain. Also less picking up the kid from the ground.

Y3 : Sleep is finally getting better. Not perfect but much more under control. Added a weighted blanket that maybe also improve sleep quality. Health is still not great and I get a lot of stress from work. Got out of shape completely (as in needing to buy new clothes). 

Steps taken :

Work : refusing more tasks and trying to shift some responsibilities to others even if it comes a bit at the cost of career evolution.
Food : I experienced keto a few times but I have a hard maintaining it. In Germany the beer is great and bread is everywhere. Regular dinner is bread with toppings of cheese, butter, ham ...
Sport : Wife is supporting in making sure I get enough time to go to the gym. Problem lies with my motivation and energy level (despite knowing that doing sport actually gives me energy).
Health : drink more water, coffee with lion's mane, 6 keto delivered meals a week to prevent me from eating junk food when I'm lunching on my own.


It's getting better but I have been so down and tired lately that I only thought about quitting my job and resting. As I am the main contributor to income in our couple, it also brings other challenges. Finally I think that rather than doing that, it would make more sense and would be more sustainable to use my income to invest in my health and improve my (our) quality of life.

What would be your different advices ?

Vitamin and food supplements ?
Red light therapy ? 
Breath training ? 
Personal trainer for a few months ?
Abandon the idea of keto ?

Thanks for your help and happy new year !

TLDR: Improved sleep and diet increased my total and free T more than testosterone boosting supplements.

I recently turned 40, demanding career, wife and two kids. Work out 2 to 3 days a week.

1st result from March '24. Supplements: Daily 400mg of Tongkat Ali and 200g of Cistanche. Bulking phase, so was lifting 3 days a week. Had high cholesterol and high blood pressure.

2nd result from December '24. Went completely off Tongkat Ali and cut cistanche down to a few days a week in an effort to reduce my blood pressure and high cholesterol. Dialled in my sleep more and improved my diet. Focused on regular sleep times, stopped late night eating. Used Oura ring to track my metrics. Started eating maybe 20-30% cleaner, more fibre intake and less junk food, but no drastic changes.Total T and free T improved by 10% and 20% respectively.

Moral of the story? Do the basic things. Fix your sleep and diet before you start looking at supplements and hormone supplementation.

1ge0xiq,Biohackers,I can't seem to stop partying at the weekends,"I don't see myself as an addict, but I have a serious weekend hedonism problem. The self loathing I feel as a result of this is becoming an enduring problem, but I can't seem to shake it off. 

33M, I spend five days a week being the healthiest person I know - exercising regularly, no sugar, alcohol, weed or coffee, eating mostly right, getting enough sleep, supplementing, meditating, cold showers, etc, etc.

I have ADHD, so do struggle with a constant need for stimulation/ dopamine and so find myself repeating behaviours that I know drain me like too much phone time, listening to music all day every day and eating overly rich foods. 

But for the most part I'm very health conscious and aware of the things I consume. 

Then comes Friday night and suddenly all I want to do is get drunk, spend all my money and get 'out of my mind' on a dancefloor, someone's kitchen or my own house. Weekend evenings are inevitably spent intoxicating myself somehere, I might manage a hike or a day trip on a good day, then Sundays it's weed, movies and junk food. Monday it's deep regret and a feeling that I am not achieving what I want because of this weekly blowout. 

I suspect that perhaps living in such a restricted way in the week makes me crave this release so intensely, coupled with the fact I live in a city that is renowned for its partying (Bristol, UK) and all my friends socialise by drinking, sniffing cocaine and taking other substances, especially in the long winters when there isn't much to do outside. 

I'm also aware I'm maybe just being hard on myself and I'm just in the process of finding the right balance between enjoying life and being disciplined. 

But I deeply feel like I'd like to cut alcohol at some point, but I'm not sure how at this point. 

After this weekend I looked at my bank account and realised I spent everything I saved this month on tickets, alcohol, food and taxis. Enough is enough. 

I've come to this community becuase I think there are people here who have struggled with this, or still are, and can offer advice, words of wisdom, support or ways to get a release that isn't so harmful to my health and finances.

1g5pz0x,Biohackers,Sleep theory,"It's well established that sleep is a pillar of health and needed to function optimally. But, could it be that the reason people are healthier, live longer, have better brain health etc is because when you sleep well, you exercise more, you eat better, you are in a better mood, you socialize more, etc.  So in other words, it's not so much the sleep itself, but the effect it has in helping you avoid harmful things (quick easy junk food) and doing the physical things that lead to health (exercise, socialize).  The reason I wonder is that IF one only sleeps 5-6 hours per night, but still eats healthy, keeps up the exercise routine, etc, is it really a detriment? No matter what I do, I can rarely sleep more than 6 but I still eat super clean, exercise quite a bit, have more energy than people around me that are decades younger, etc. and I'd like to quit worrying about it.

1g1r5wb,Biohackers,How to long to see/feel benifits of changing lifestyle ? ,"I 30F had been a smoker for at least 10 years or so and mostly sedentary the last 4 years approx. but also always skinny (apart from my most recent and second pregnancy, almost down to healthy weight now). 

I recently was found to have moderate fatty liver and immediately cut sugar, junk food, simple grains and potatoes. 
Since then I have dramatically increased my vegetable intake, I now have multiple serves in almost every meal of the day. I only eat complex carbs with high fibre content and low or no sugar. Protiens are lean meat, eggs and seafood. I have a few serves of dairy a day, I am breastfeeding so I still need grains and dairy to keep up with the nutritional demand on my body. I have a couple of serves of fruit a day. I take a breastfeeding vitamin. 
I only drink lemon water in the morning, water through the day, green tea, coconut water occasionally and an espresso coffee occasionally (no sweeteners)

No medications. 

My plan for exercise is 30mins of incline treadmill brisk walking 5x a week with some weight/resistance training 2x a week. I would also like to do yoga for mental well-being and flexibility. 

I quit smoking 10 months ago now and I'm never taking it back up again. I also don't drink anymore at all and will never look at alcohol the same again. 

I can't do much about sleep at this point as I'm breastfeeding a 6 month old and I'm up through the night. It will be a while until I can get better sleep.  

I'm very serious about changing my lifestyle, I struggle with depression (starting therapy at the end of this month ) which is why I was mostly sedentary for quite a few years, now have low muscle tone. I want to get healthy, have energy for my kids and at least live long enough to see them grow up, hopefully longer. 

Will it be a few years until I see and feel a difference with these changes to my diet and lifestyle ? Will I still see the benifits even if I can't improve the sleep at this time ? I plan to breastfeed until at least 1 year mark or longer. 
Or Will I only see benifits of the changes after my liver heals ? ",2024-10-12 03:13:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1g1r5wb/how_to_long_to_seefeel_benifits_of_changing/
1fravnh,Biohackers,Is there a timeframe for seeing results after committing to a healthy lifestyle?,"Basically title.

At this point I‚Äôm well read on every facet of being healthy, but I fall into holes of *unhealthy behaviors* at various breaking points in my life. Just recently I was on summer break, and I was either home with my (God bless them) somewhat dysfunctional family, or alone in my college house with none of my friends around. 

I resorted to weed, late night junk food binges, porn, and abusing stimulants/ nootropics during the day as an attempt at reversing how horrible I‚Äôd feel during the day.

I‚Äôd say I was relatively unhealthy for about 6 months straight, from the winter until about three weeks ago. It started when I got COVID and had to quarantine myself without family to take care of me, and irresponsibly pivoted towards a ton of social media, video games, weed, junk food, and porn. I‚Äôve dialed weed back to about once a week or less and only on special social occasions, I masturbate to porn roughly once a week also now, my diet has been great except for a couple cheat meals where I throw in some mac n cheese with my rotisserie chicken (most importantly for me I consume hardly any processed sugar), but I‚Äôm still on social media a lot, and although I don‚Äôt play video games as often since I‚Äôm busy with school, they do eat my mind away when I‚Äôm bored during class (I‚Äôve been obsessed with story games lately)

That leads me to say, I‚Äôm very capable of sticking with a healthy regimen, and have succeeded in the past. As school starts again, I know what I need to do in order to jump back into the flow state of health. I‚Äôve gradually cut things out and reimplemented certain things again, but my question is, how long do people take to start feeling *wayy* better again after a dense period of poor health management?

This is wreaking havoc on my sleep, I've had terrible insomnia for 5 days now. This has been an issue in the past as well.

I am currently in the best shape of my life, and at my lowest weight in decades.

Any ideas what might be causing this issue? Is it a blood sugar thing? I am not eating a ton during the day, but I'm eating enough. Sometimes I will eat dinner 3 or 4 hours before bed, so I will go to bed feeling full. I feel like if I just stayed awake instead of going to sleep, I would not get these late night hunger pangs, so it seems to be related to sleep.

Current plan is just to drink a lot more water, which I can never seem to remember/force myself to do. But this issue is driving me nuts! It's not a new issue, it would happen from time to time in the past, but now it's happening much more frequently, and insomnia has been brutal.

1di47qj,Biohackers,BDNF Quickly Understood (and How to Increase it),"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, is a nerve growth protein (neurotrophin) crucial to the development and maintenance of the human brain. When we explore and learn, BDNF is at work, restructuring the brain, growing new dendrite branches ([Horch & Katz, 2002](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn927)), and in turn, these activities themselves promote BDNF expression, enhancing mood and subsequent learning.

BDNF and mitochondria have a reciprocal relationship. The activity of mitochondrial complex 1-initiated oxidative phosphorylation corresponds to BDNF activity, and BDNF in turn interacts with ATPase to enhance mitochondrial respiratory coupling, increasing ATP production ([Markham, et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22288477/)). At the same time, ATP increases BDNF expression ([Klein, et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3360754/)). This reciprocity aligns with Ray Peat‚Äôs idea that ‚Äúenergy and structure are interdependent, at every level.‚Äù

[BDNF ‚Äòdonor‚Äô neurons \(green\) increasing branching in neighboring neurons \(red\). BDNF is a fertilizer for brain cell connections.](https://preview.redd.it/urz4g5w6667d1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=30d6f9230e6077526da9399ec16d43881c70abff)

In stress and aging, including in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, BDNF expression is markedly decreased, impairing neural adaptability and function.

Chronic stress induces mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain, leading to a reduction in BDNF expression ([Liu & Zhou, 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22244747/)). Thus, in the stressed, traumatized, and inflamed, there is an impaired ability to learn and rigid psychospiritual functioning.

However, there are many simple strategies by which we can promote and preserve BDNF, protecting our clarity and sanity, which are discussed further down.

BDNF is largely, if not primarily, the mechanism by which antidepressants work. Antidepressant drugs increase the transcription factor CREB, leading to a delayed increase in BDNF ([Conti, et al., 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6757540/); [Casarotto, et al., 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9666396/)). By halting mitochondria at presynaptic sites so that they accumulate, BDNF increases neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity, improving cognition and mood ([Su, et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3894308/)).

BDNF is produced in the muscles, promoting mitochondrial quality via enhancing mitofission (the separation of one mitochondria into two) and mitophagy (the recycling of damaged mitochondria) ([Ahuja, et al., 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9225428/)). This helps to explain exercise‚Äôs ability to enhance resilience to stress and oppose aging. The BDNF protein is small, so it‚Äôs able to cross the blood brain barrier and exert, for example, positive effects on the brain in response to muscular secretion from exercise ([Pan, et al., 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9886678/)).

BDNF raises cellular antioxidant capacity by upregulating the enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 ([He & Katusic, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026286212000027)). In oxidative stress, BDNF activity drops, indicating both its depletion in response to increased demand and disrupted expression presumably due to oxidative stress impairing cellular resilience.

BDNF facilitates glucose transport (by inducing GLUT3) and increases insulin sensitivity (via insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and parasympathetic tone (via brainstem cholinergic neurons), assisting adaptivity of the organism in confronting challenging activities ([Tsuchida, et al., 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11380073/); [Marosi & Mattson, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3915771/)).

By acting on hypothalamic neurons, BDNF suppresses appetite, and has been shown to induce weight loss by reducing food intake and increasing the resting metabolic rate, with more energy burned as heat ([Pelleymounter, et al., 1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7534721/); [Urabe, et al., 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2536); [Wu & Xu, 2022](https://www.eneuro.org/content/9/2/ENEURO.0009-22.2022)).

Cancer cells use BDNF to their own benefit, which sparked temporary concern over BDNF overexpression being involved in cancer, but it was more recently shown that the body responds to cancer by overexpressing BDNF in the hypothalamus, amplifying anti-tumor immune system activity and decreasing proteins that protect cancer cells ([Radin & Patel, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28739680/)).

Replenishing antioxidant stores, for example nutritionally (exogenous antioxidants) or through environmental enrichment (which increases endogenous antioxidants), restores and maintains BDNF ([Fahnestock, et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019745801000151X); [Lee, et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31861353/)).

The hours of sunshine a person gets positively correlates to serum BDNF concentrations, helping to explain the seasonal affective disorder phenomenon ([Molendijk, et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3487856/)).

[Serum BDNF concentrations by month of sampling.](https://preview.redd.it/algusg54667d1.jpg?width=742&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8c24a080a34aeb0eb517997387a8da5f3ddb82b)

As for the adderall, I usually only take it on days I have school. If I‚Äôm there I can usually focus on homework. But if I take it at home I won‚Äôt have the same experience. I will still feel like I have no energy and lie down without doing anything. 

I also smoke weed a few nights a week. This is probably relevant, but I feel tired with or without it. I am not smoking all day though and very rarely in the morning. 

Since I take trazodone, I sleep pretty well. Sometimes too well. It‚Äôs not unheard of for me to sleep for 12 hours, I do this maybe once a week. 

I eat fairly well. Not always 100% balanced but I‚Äôm definitely not eating junk food often. I make sure I eat protein and carbs, and I‚Äôm snacking throughout the day. I also drink plenty of water.

Most of my colds are short, thankfully. A few days ago I had a cold that I caught from my husband (who caught it from his daughter, who is in preschool) that only lasted a day, with congestion being the lingering symptom and it went away less than a week.

Ever since my stepkid started preschool we've been getting sick a lot, and I can't afford to miss work. 

I already take Vit C, Zinc daily... when I remember, I take some probiotics since the immune system is in the gut.

I was wondering if there were any other supplements I may not know about, or foods that would help?

I'm 25M, and in about a year i went from abuse drugs, meds and booze (not something extreme anyway)  junk food and no physical activity to a completely different lifestyle.
Now i find myself really committed in what i think is a good routine. I eat in a slight calorie surplus ( trying to build muscle) of almost only whole foods, get 8 hours of sleep, a good and careful supplementation of minerals, oils, vitamins and other nutrients to match everyday what i tracked to be my needs. 
This just to explain i don't think i'm missing anything.
This is my day

~8 hours of sleep.

7.30 wake up ando go to work

12 to 13.30 lunch and a 20-minute nap 

13.30-17.30 work

Go home and 18-19.30 workout

dinner and after a short time with my family and a shower, i find myself at ~20.30 completely exhausted.
Weekends are a bit different but i use the time to recover energies but anything exciting.
I mean, go fishing, have a beer with friends or create something with my bbq but mostly relax and recovery
Here comes the problem: i work in mechanical engineering and after this my mind is exhausted. After workout my body is exhausted. Dinner fills my stomach (lots of lean protein and veggies) and by this time i have no spark of energy.
No will to go out with friends, no will to work on my personal projects.
I really, REALLY want to work on a funny side hustle which is poker playing. After dinner till sleep.
 I used to do it successfully when i was in high school but there was time and energy to be spent.
For everyone who knows, this is a task that requires focus and performance.
But even if it was any other activity, the main problem is that i can't simply find the strength to do it. To do anything.
I tried to push a little bit with caffeine, racetams and even modafinil, but this is not something i find acceptable in long term and it wont work anyway.
This makes me feel really bad because every day is becoming the same.
Sleeping less or not to train is not an option, i could lose my discipline
Have i found a limit that i cant go past? 
Has someone found in my situation and optimized it/ overcome it?

188wafp,Biohackers,Top 5 Biohacks to level up your health,"**1. Sleep like a boss**

Aim for 7-8 hours of shut-eye each night to give your body the rest it needs to function at its best. When you skimp on sleep, you're setting yourself up for fatigue, mood swings, brain fog, and even accidents.

**2. Fuel your body with goodness**

Ditch the junk food and load up on fruits, veggies, and whole grains. Your body will thank you with increased energy, a boosted immune system, and a trimmer waistline.

**3. Get movin' and groovin'**

Regular exercise is a must for both physical and mental well-being. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. You'll feel more energized, de-stressed, and sleep like a baby.

**4. Chill out, max**

Chronic stress can wreak havoc on your health. Find healthy ways to manage stress, like yoga, meditation, or simply spending time in nature. Your mind and body will thank you for it.

**5. Get regular checkups**

Prevention is key! Make sure to see your doctor for regular checkups to stay on top of your health and catch any potential problems early on.

In addition to these general biohacks, there are a ton of other ways to boost your health. Experiment with adding probiotics to your diet, taking supplements, or using essential oils to find what works best for you.",2023-12-02 05:10:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/188wafp/top_5_biohacks_to_level_up_your_health/

1krfz5e,Supplements,What‚Äôs in Your Stack if You Train Hard and also Party a Little Too Hard?,"I‚Äôve lurked in here for a while and figured it was finally time to open the floor to advice that goes beyond the typical ‚Äúsleep more, eat better‚Äù type of replies (although yes‚ÄîI‚Äôm working on those too).

I‚Äôm 27, living in a big city, and pretty active. I bike everywhere weather permitting, hit the gym 4/5 days a week, and genuinely enjoy pushing myself physically. My main fitness goals are building lean muscle, staying mentally sharp, and improving recovery so I can keep showing up consistently.

That said, weekends are where structure goes to die. I enjoy a good night out‚Äîdrinks, late nights, junk food. Not ashamed of it, just being honest. I also use Zyn (nicotine pouches) on a daily basis, and while I know the obvious health red flags, I‚Äôm curious if anyone else here has experience balancing that habit while still trying to dial in performance and wellness. I‚Äôve always been more interested in the ‚Äúrealistic optimization‚Äù approach rather than trying to live inside of a wellness vacuum.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently taking:

Morning: 

- Nature's Way Vitamin C
- Sports Research¬Æ Vitamin D3 + K2
- Pure Methylated Multivitamin

Afternoon:

- THORNE Super EPA - Omega-3 Fatty Acids EPA 425mg & DHA 270mg Supplement
- Nature Made Potassium Gluconate 550 mg
- THORNE Zinc Bisglycinate 30mg

Night: 

- KSM-66 Ashwagandha Root Powder Extract
- Magnesium Glycinate 400mg

I was using creatine for a while but I have recently cut it out. The side effects weren‚Äôt terrible but I skipped it for a few nights and found myself feeling more well rested in the AM. 

Also recently signed up for Everyday Dose (the mushroom coffee). I am not sold on it but I don‚Äôt mind the taste and it‚Äôs convenient for mornings that time is limited. The coffee shop by my office charges about $10 for an iced latte with oat milk so everyday dose is actually cheaper. 

What I‚Äôm looking for:

1. Supplement recs for recovery, focus, gut health, or anything that helps smooth out the highs and lows of a work hard/play hard lifestyle.

2.Thoughts on Zyn‚Äîespecially from people who use it and are still optimizing other parts of their health.

3.General feedback from others living actively but not perfectly.

Appreciate any input.

But, that aside, I am 40+ female with a background in collegiate sports. I‚Äôve been varying levels of active and dialed in since then (including periods of not at all), but decided to make a big change about 6 mos ago. Almost completely cut out alcohol, dialed in my diet and track everything from exercise, macros and glucose. I work out intensely 5-6 days per week and have varying levels of physicality with my job. 

I fear I‚Äôve replaced junk food and alcohol with the excitement of supplements so I‚Äôd love a review. I love data and tinkering. 

My goal is to slow aging, repair damage and make my body more efficient. Better sleep, better performance, better skin and better recovery. I‚Äôm not looking to become 20, just be good for my age. I don‚Äôt intend on being a triathlete, just strong and healthy. The aesthetics are fine, but really just want to function like my best self. I‚Äôm also at an age of hormone changes, so want to give my body what it needs. 

Here‚Äôs my (very long) stack. Since I eat relatively healthy and take a lot of supplements, I almost never take the full dose incase of overloading and fat soluble vs water. Some of these I take daily, some a few times per week so I do not overdo it. 

Workout/recovery: 
protein shake
Perfect Aminos
Primal Queen beef organs 
Liposomal NAD+ (perpetual life AEON black, has lots of stuff in it) 
Urolithin A
Preworkout w bcaa and EAA
Creatine HCL
Liposomal glutathione 
Silverfern‚Äôs Build

Regular regimen:

Skin:

Sleep:

perpetual life white (lots of stuff in it) 

Gut health (this has always been an issue for me)
Digestive enzymes 
Upper GI support

1jiwwn9,Supplements,Is there anything universally agreed upon that will help with cravings? (Even if its minimal).,"I'm sure this has been beaten to death on this Subreddit and then-some, but I'm re-visiting this topic again to see if perhaps there's anything that's been overlooked or is new.

Does anyone know of anything that helps at all with cravings?

I have an odd addiction to the chocolate tasing protein bars and snacks. I will eat one as a substitute for regular junk food or a meal, but then find myself craving a second, or a third, or a fourth. One Quest cookie will quickly turn into an entire box, even when I'm not actually hungry.

My brain yanks at my heart strings all day long until I give in and eat one. 

It's both funny and frustrating too because I don't have this issue with things like McDonalds, potato chips, donuts, potatoes or pasta. I generally eat a super low carb diet, but it's the protein bars and protein snacks that I just crave and struggle with. For reference, I lost 106 lbs. back in 2022 doing keto and fasting and have since kept up with many of my keto diet habits, doing low carb and low sugar is generally really easy minus the cravings for Quest bars, and sweet tasting protein snacks.

Is there anything out there that might help calm this down and help my brain chill out with the cravings? Even if the help is minimal anything would be welcome at this point.

I need to get my brain and body un-addicted which is probably at least a 6-week chore.

I took two of the Olly Combat Cravings pills today with my lunch to see if those help or not (***a co-worker of mine had some in her desk and offered to let me try them to see if I like them or not***).

Suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciated.

1jan47m,Supplements,"Turmeric megadosing with berberine, zinc, and NAC very likely gave me anemia, already teetering on the edge of it for a long time most likely","I wrote a reply to another post regarding this and am still waiting on appointments for blood tests, but I think this should be recorded for the archives. So it turns out that curcumin chelates iron, quite a lot actually. There is one recorded case of it decisively causing deficiency for a 66 y/o man taking 3g daily.

For about a month I took in the ballpark of 1.5 to 3g daily (1 to 1/2 teaspoon) as a tea with other things, cinnamon, cacao, etc. it seemed very beneficial for my fucked up gut microbiome (SIBO) so I included it as part of my protocol. This involved berberine which has well documented chelation for iron as well. NAC was also a component as a biofilm buster, and may be a weak copper chelator. There was also zinc carnosine which probably threw off my ratios for copper absorption. Only 15mg of elemental zinc, but when taken near mealtime it very likely is enough to thoroughly throw off the ratio. Finally, the restrictive diet for this protocol likely didn't have as much of both copper and iron, copper which is critical for iron mobilization into red blood cells.

The good new is that my protocol greatly improved my digestive symptoms, and nearly eradicated SIBO. Remains to be seen though, as it could be growing again now that I am slowly reintroducing foods. I continue to take ginger and artichoke extracts with every meal to ensure the motility and bile are high, addressing the root cause and preventing regrowth.

The first 5 days or so, turmeric on its own seemed almost like a cure! I felt so clear headed right after drinking turmeric tea in a way which clearly wasn't placebo. I wasn't adding black pepper or oils, so I have no idea how much I was actually absorbing, but it must've been doing something for body-wide inflammation caused by the metabolites and secretions of bacteria. I then read that it would not absorb well without those, so I started grinding black pepper into my tea along with a bit of coconut oil. It was subtle, but I believe it's around this moment that I began to lose the brainfog lifting effect and things took a turn for the worse again.

My insomnia and general fatigue progressively worsened again (fatigue but not really nodding off, feeling tired yet awake at the same time), depression, unexplained anxiety, poor mood, etc. I don't know for sure if it's always been exactly like this, but the color of my skin now as of today appears very off to a noticeable extent. Lifeless, zombie-like, especially obvious when standing next to other people it's like gray or green. It led me into another deep dive down memory lane, reviewing every single photo and selfie over years and years, and I discovered that I've most likely been borderline anemic. Especially photos around other people the contrast in skin tone is stark. The online resources on anemia all talk about ""pale skin"" but this is completely meaningless as chronically inside people are also ""pale"". Now that we're coming out of winter where nobody has had any sun, and comparing to other chronically inside folks, it's clear that there are two different kinds of pale. Theirs is like a lively pink color. It's pale, but it's still vibrant. Mine is like all the colors is being sucked out or my skin and looks transparent.

In hindsight there were a myriad of other clues that were even more obvious a decade ago in high school. Intense restless leg syndrome, needing the open up the window in winter at night because I was so hot I'd be drenched in sweats, meanwhile shivering at school at just room temperature, diagnosed ADHD which is now understood to be a common diagnostic for iron deficiency, chewing ice, so on and so forth. I'm not really sure what is the link with ice chewing or why it happens, I don't do that nowadays or crave it because it just seem dumb to me chewing ice, but I'm definitely still a texture guy, love my food very crunchy. The symptoms changed over the years as I grew older, got to a more healthy weight, eating more vegetables and less junk food, and becoming more physically active.

Still, when I should've been healthy I would be out of breath simply walking and struggling to hold a conversation walking at normal pace. I only recently noticed this could be linked to anemia while reading up on it. I always suspected something didn't quite add up, couldn't seem to build good cardio regardless of the effort I put in. I'd be jogging all summer every other day, and three months later still can't keep up pace with any of my buddies who are moderately active but not to this extent. I would and still get insanely tired as well after cardio, the day's basically over I can't work or do anything after. They're having a blast enjoying the weather and holding a conversation while I'm plugging 3 word sentences in-between breaths. I thought it was damage to my lungs from smoking weed, but now I'm not so sure it's to this extent? Shockingly I just learnt that smoking raises hemoglobin, so maybe that explains why I've always had such spontaneous clarity of mind after smoking weed compared to other people. But conversely some suggest it may impact iron uptake in the gut, so it'd be a vicious cycle. In hindsight it feels like my brain is telling me ""get this into your body asap to survive"" whenever there's weed around me, literally craving in the same way that people describe craving dirt or ice, like it will make me healthy or more functioning.

Anyway I'm trying to score an appointment with my GP and will request full comprehensive blood tests, RBC, iron panel, copper, B12, zinc, vitamin D, and any other relevant mineral and vitamin to confirm my suspicion soon. Stay safe everyone and get tested, supplements are no joke. I will update this thread when I get the results in a month or two.",2025-03-13 21:21:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jan47m/turmeric_megadosing_with_berberine_zinc_and_nac/
1j77r98,Supplements,Eating junk food but taking supplements,"

I can't maintain a healthy, balanced diet because if I did, it would cost me a lot of time and effort to plan and prepare meals. So, it's easier for me not to think too much about what I eat. I don‚Äôt count calories or track how much protein or carbs I consume I just eat whatever I crave at the moment.  

I've never had a problem with my weight; I've always been slim. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt feel like eating simply because I'm too lazy to prepare food. In those cases, I just eat some junk food for a quick and easy meal.  

However, I take a lot of supplements and vitamins.  

From food alone, I estimate that my vitamin C intake is only about 10% of what I need because some days, I don‚Äôt eat any vegetables or fruit. But I take 1000 mg of vitamin C daily, along with other vitamins like zinc and B12.  

Today, for breakfast, I had chocolate and coffee. Three hours later, I took my vitamins.  

So my question is: Is taking vitamins alone healthy and effective? Do these vitamins work if I eat mostly junk food?  

Sometimes, I don‚Äôt eat anything for four hours and take vitamins on an empty stomach.  

Is that healthy and effective? Will the vitamins still work?

1iafjyt,Supplements,Help! I'm New to Supplements and I Need Some Advice,"I'm not sure where to start this post so I will start it by saying, I have already had bloodwork done fairly recently. The first time I had blood taken, I didn't fast beforehand (it had completely slipped my mind) and my results showed an elevated white blood cell count and my urine test showed some protein in my urine. My GP found it a little concerning and she asked if I had recently been sick. I hadn't been. She scheduled me for more bloodwork two weeks later (I fasted this time) and everything was back to normal. We didn't do a urine test the second time. Everything else was normal both times so as far as I know, I'm not deficient in anything.

I have a suspicion that I could have some kind of a food intolerance or allergy and that's where the elevated WBC count came from. After I eat literally anything, I just feel sluggish. I also get heartburn and mild nausea sometimes and just a general ""heavy"" feeling in my stomach. It almost feels like my insides are inflamed/irritated. I'm trying to gain weight because I'm pretty severely underweight and it's so hard when eating feels like something I have to suffer through. Despite being active on a bunch of junk food and soda subreddits (LOL), I try to eat pretty clean. I rarely actually eat ""junk"" usually just a snack here and there as a rare treat. Most fast food is gross to me so I eat it maybe once or twice a month.

Right now, I'm trying things at home while I look for a doctor covered by my insurance that can help. 

I've been taking at least one 50MG peppermint oil capsule daily for the past two weeks. Sometimes I'll take two if I'm feeling extra bloated that day but I never take them at the same time. I've read that you're supposed to take them an hour before eating but I've found that they work the best when I take one in the morning and one right after lunch. These seem to help a lot. For the first time in years, I regularly have an appetite.

I also started taking 450 MG of licorice root to help protect the lining of my stomach from NSAID use. It makes me feel great but I'm nervous to take too much because I keep reading that it's dangerous to take long term. How long is long term? I take naproxen pretty frequently because of back pain from my job and the licorice root seems to keep the queasy feeling I get from it away. Should I switch to DGL instead?

1hwk7bw,Supplements,Extreme stress and insomnia what supplements?,"So I have had an extremely stressful few months, performance managed at work, the death of my best friend and now potentially losing my home all the while dealing with raising 2 small kids. 

All this resulted in severe anxiety and insomnia. Drs have been great. I have started an SSRI and Zopiclone a month ago feeling better each day. 

I have had blood tests and my Folate and Vit D levels were severely below normal levels. I started supplementing with 5mg Folate and 4000iu Vit D3 with K2 daily and changed my diet from junk food to a Mediterranean diet. Upped my water intake to 2.5 litres a day too.

I have also started supplementing 100mg Co-Q10, L-Theanine, Magnesium Glycinate, Ashwaganda and Zinc. 

I also take 600mg NAC on an empty stomach first thing in the morning.

Am I missing anything should I add or take away or change my regime?

1hho0r5,Supplements,This is very concerning. My growth is stunted at 17,"**TL;DR:**  
I‚Äôm a 17M with stunted growth due to severe nutrient deficiencies (Vitamin D: 3 ng/mL, B12: 71 ng/mL, etc.) caused by years of malnutrition. Doctors in my area don‚Äôt know how to treat deficiencies with proper cofactors, so I‚Äôm seeking help here to design an effective supplement protocol. Bloodwork attached‚Äîany advice or insights would mean a lot!

I'm pretty sorted on the diet as I'm working with a dietician, but really need some help figuring out the right supplements with the right dosage for me, looking to maximize my growth as I still have 2-3 years of significant growth left according to my doctor.

\----

I‚Äôm 17M, and my growth is stunted. (I look like a 13-14 year old) I recently got bloodwork done, and the results are honestly terrifying. My doctor confirmed I‚Äôm critically deficient in multiple nutrients, and my body hasn‚Äôt fully started puberty yet. Here are some of my deficiency numbers:

* **Vitamin D**: **3 ng/mL** (basically nonexistent)
* **B12**: **71 ng/mL** (super low)
* **Ferritin**: **29 ng/mL**
* **Homocysteine**: **16** (way too high)
* **Zinc, Copper**: both low

The endocrinologist said my hormones (testosterone, FSH, etc.) are also on the low side but can improve if I fix my nutrient levels. They mentioned I could still experience ‚Äúcatch-up growth‚Äù because my bone age is delayed (it came back as 15 while my actual age is 17). That gives me some hope, but I‚Äôm completely lost on how to design a proper recovery plan. My Testosterone levels came 195ng/ml which is on the lower end of someone in early-mid puberty.

The reason for my delayed growth is Malnutrition -- I ate junk and processed food all the time while being on very low calories (I had a very little appetite), No physical activity at all which led to my growth stunting and me looking a lot younger than my peers at high school which really bothers me a lot.

Doctors in my area don‚Äôt really know much about nutrition‚Äîthey just tell me to ‚Äúeat more,‚Äù but I can‚Äôt tolerate meat or dairy. I‚Äôm completely vegetarian, so I rely on plant-based foods and supplements.

**Symptoms I‚Äôm Dealing With:**

* Still in early puberty (my voice hasn‚Äôt fully deepened, No facial hair at all and I look much younger than I am).
* Low body weight (due to malnutrition)
* Brain fog and trouble focusing.
* Low energy and stamina.

**What I‚Äôve Started So Far:**

I‚Äôve started taking supplements recently and made some changes to my diet. Here‚Äôs my current protocol:

* **Vitamin D3**: 10,000 IU daily
* **Vitamin K2 (MK-7):** 100 mcg
* **Magnesium Glycinate**: 400 mg
* **Methylcobalamin (B12)**: 5,000 mcg sublingual daily
* **Thorne Basic B Complex**: 1 pill daily or every other day
* **Algae-based Omega-3**: 1,500 mg daily
* **Calcium Citrate Powder**: 300 mg daily

I‚Äôm about to start taking a copper-zinc supplement as well. I‚Äôm eating only home-cooked, nutrient-rich meals now and trying to avoid junk food completely.

**Request for Help:**

If anyone has experience with deficiencies like this or knows how to design a proper protocol, I‚Äôd really appreciate your help. I have access to good supplements and am willing to make any changes needed. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm on the right track and not missing anything important.

Please take a look at my bloodwork (attached below) and let me know if anything stands out or if I need to adjust my protocol. How long should I expect it to take before I start seeing improvements?

**Tests I Got Done:**

* **Vitamin D**
* **Vitamin B12** (Active B12/Holotranscobalamin)
* **Iron Panel** (including Ferritin)
* **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**
* **Electrolytes**
* **Parietal Cell Antibody**
* **Homocysteine**
* **Zinc and Copper**
* **Ceruloplasmin**
* **Vitamin A**
* **Methylmalonic Acid (MMA)**
* **Intrinsic Factor Antibody**

This whole situation is really overwhelming for me, Iam very careful about taking the right supplements and a proper dose, closely monitoring my post-supplement symptoms.

If you‚Äôve been through something similar or know what works, your advice would mean a lot to me.

My blood sugars are on the lower end, but I have frequent sugar cravings.

I used to walk a lot but in winter is more difficult for me, so I deffo need to increase cardio.

Is there any supplement that can help with sugar cravings? Maybe inositol?

What about supplements to help with overcoming skinny fat, in addition to lifting and diet?

Was sleeping the same but felt less tired. Wasn‚Äôt eating junk food. Enjoyed my hobby of being more active and social. Like seriously people were constantly teeling me I like a different person (more social/positive). 

I started taking 1 a day and now taking 2 (at different times and it‚Äôs better this way because I feel better throughout the day). When I started taking them, I got a real good kick. The bottle recommended 3 a day so I didn‚Äôt feeling bad increasing it to 2 a day after 2 weeks. 

I noticed some days they worked better than other days. I noticed I need to take them with food and drink plenty of water. But overall I was doing much better taking them. 

Well I ran out of them and ordered a new bottle. So I‚Äôve been off them for 5 days now. 
And to be honest, I feel horrible. My mood is horrible. No energy. Depression. Mood swings. Eating junk food. Can‚Äôt sleep. Feeling restless. 
I honestly hate myself right now. 

Is this normal? 
Do you think I‚Äôm just going through withdrawal (lol)? 

What will I do one day when my body tolerance wont process manganese? Is that a thing. 

I plan on going back on them.

1erhv77,Supplements,"New to this, please help an ADHD woman figure it out","Hi pals,

I'm very new in researching all this stuff. I've tried various supplements and vitamins, and have been taking a general multi-vit and fish oil and stuff on and off for years but I'd like to actually tighten all of it and see what truly works for me.

The thing is that I have pretty bad ADHD & there's so much info that I get lost, jumping from one thing to another. Can anyone help with some ideas of what works or doesn't for me?

My info:

* 34F, 145lbs, 5'6"". Decently active (gym 2-5x/wk + some random activities) and athletic-ish as I've been doing sports all my life. I do tend to carry extra weight in my midsection.
* Family history: higher cholesterol, depression, thyroid, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure.
* I also have very, very bad ADHD (probs with executive function) and pre-anemia/low iron. I also have a muscle shoulder issue that I don't think can be solved with vitamins, but maybe can help the muscles.
* I have mild psoriasis on a couple of small places and don't drink enough water (idk why it's so hard for me). I try, but I'm often likely underwatered.
* Used to eat pescatarian for nearly a decade, but this year started eating meat and maintain what I consider to be a healthy diet aka generally California/Mediterranean, with lots of veggies/fruit, some meat/fish, eggs as brek, not much junk food like chips or fast food, and lower carb as much as I can (though I do love a good noodle). My only problems I'd say is dessert or bored snacking, but I try to limit that too and try to have dessert in form of fruit. The Adderall has made my appetite pretty low though.

For ADHD/depression, I take Prozac (40mg) & Adderall (30mg-ish, depends on the day).  
For health, I take an Iron tablet, a Calm Mind capsule (bacopa, gotu kola, L-theanine, holy basil), fish oil, a Calcium/Magnesium/Zinc/vit D mix, Ubiquinol and B12. I also usually take vitamin C with iron, but just recently ran out. I have also taken a lion's mane tincture before, but didn't record the results though I felt like it did help, even though it was nasty tasting (I put it directly on my tongue)

**My primary issues** that I'd like to solve are low energy/feeling tired & sleepy when I shouldn't (even when I get 8+ hrs of sleep), consistent brain fog and inability to concentrate. I'd also like better hair and nails, as they tend to be dry.  
**My secondary issues** are better sleep, better metabolism & digestion, building muscle/losing fat easier and maybe better liver function (I partied a bunch in my 20s) and eye sight.",2024-08-13 20:10:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1erhv77/new_to_this_please_help_an_adhd_woman_figure_it/

1cikbij,Supplements,Why am I not absorbing chromium and iodine from my multivitamin?,"Hi all. Last year I was diagnosed with a lot of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. I had issues with dry/brittle hair, skin and nails, teeth and gums, getting sick, sugar and junk food cravings, etc...  I corrected these by taking a multivitamin, D3/K2, and magnesium (switched between citrate and glycinate but I liked both). Thankfully all my vitamin and mineral levels went up and I feel much better. EXCEPT for iodine and chromium. My multivitamin has 150 mcg iodine (in potassium iodide form) and 35 mcg chromium (in chromium picolinate form). 

What seems to be causing this poor absorption? Both are provided in well-absorbed and bioavailable forms. So I don't understand. I did blood work and noticed that I have low iodine levels and high testosterone (I'm a woman) and have high normal glucose and insulin. I'm concerned I might have insulin resistance or even PCOS (though I've never been diagnosed before). I recently lost a lot of weight as well so it doesn't make much sense (I did so through intermittent fasting which is great for insulin sensitivity). However I'm highly convinced my low iodine and chromium levels are responsible for this.

Thanks for all your help. If it helps to mention, I have been tested for intestinal permeability and h pylori (decreases stomach acid which makes digesting/absorbing nutrients more difficult) and these may be likely responsible for any deficiencies I had last year.",2024-05-02 16:40:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1cikbij/why_am_i_not_absorbing_chromium_and_iodine_from/

1c1rnwz,Supplements,Please review my noob stack," Hi everyone,

First of all, sorry, English is my third language, I will make many language errors.

I'd like advice on and some help with my (crazy huge) stack.

44 years old male. Until 6 weeks ago I had a very unhealthy, bad lifestyle. Much alcohol, fast food, constant stress from work, bad sleep etc. I was at BMI +30, while until my late 30's I was slightly underweight even. Then 6 weeks ago it happened, I crashed and ended up in hospital. Luckily after checks there is no sign of major issues (yet) and I was dismissed with fatty liver disease - which was diagnosed after a CT-scan, slightly elevetad liver set, particulary gamma GT. Amazingly, cholesterol levels were within normal range, and the rest of the blood tests were not too bad after all. Could have been far worse. However, this was a wake up call.

So I stopped drinking alcohol. No more junk food. Avoid sugar. Started eating fruit, vegetables, fibres ... just a 'normal' healthy diet. I have little of no exercise, do walk a lot, but nothing too intense (yet). A man has got to stort somewhere, no.

Also this early stage turnaround in lifestyle (+- 6 weeks now) lead to me googling all kinds of liver cleaning foods and supplements ... and frankly, I just could not stop ordering more stuff. So now - as a total noob - I probably have a bad stack. I wonder what I could keep on taking together what can I park for later or even stop, what can I cycle and what about dosing. What can I add or replace, etc.

Thanks in advance. Every input will be greatly appreciated.

Well, here is my daily menu as it is at the moment:

Some context to question:

 I have reasons to believe there are some heart/blood issues running in the family. Now, I am a healthy adult and I avoid frequent junk food consumption, I work out more or less. Stopped drinking heavy alcohol but I still smoke ‚òπÔ∏è

Before I get more sidetracked, I am in a bit of a conundrum. 

I read that K2 is backed up by a lot of research assessing that it improves heart and blood health (sure most of u know this so no need for details)

However, I am wondering if it actually has a negative effect on people who are prone to blood clotting? 

(also, when I bought it, the guy in the pharmacy asked if I smoke. I confirmed and he said it‚Äôs actually dangerous to take K2 if I do which also confused me)

\- Turmeric  
\- Ginger  
\- Garlic  
\- Garlic (kyolic)  
\- K2 MK-4  
\- DHEA (never tried, gotta go take a blood test for this)

  
Don't worry about the calories, I feel the greatest I ever had since I changed my diet so much, removed junk food and added more healthy food.  
Gonna reach 77-80kg and then bulk.  
The cold showers before gym are making me mentally stronger, and as soon as cold water touches my body I automatically breather fuller and stretch like there is a wire above me for posture.  
The food I eat requires minimum time of preparation, and I will improve the food 10 more weeks (like adding chicken, eggs etc).  
My goal is to become the best version of myself. I'm planning this kind of lifestyle till I die, so please don't say things such ""at your age you don't need XYZ"".  
When you suggest something, please don't say something like ""add taurine"", next to that please explain why I need it.

17xe0vn,Supplements,Any supplement to fight hereditary cholesterol?,"Is there any way to fight it except taking statins? I'm 32 years male, height/weight: 6 feet/167lb (183cm/76kg). I go to the gym, although to be honest, I didn't do cardio hence I don't have stamina, so I started running recently and will gradually increase it.

My last results were:

     Total cholesterol: 237.8
     HDL: 45.24
     Non-HDL: 192.58
     LDL: 170.15
     Triglycerides: 113.37

Last year results were similar with a bit lower numbers. On the other hand, my mother tested a week before me and hers are a bit higher numbers and were like that for 10+ years, as she says. As I mostly don't eat junk food, but cooked meals with vegetables and don't drink almost anything except water, it leads me to believe this might be hereditary cholesterol (grandparents didn't have it tho or at least we don't know).

After an appointment with a cardiologist, she prescribed me rosuvastatin 5mg to take daily, but I would like to try some supplements and cardio first and see if it will help. If not, statin is there anyway, unfortunately. Currently, I'm taking Omega3 pills, zinc 15mg, a couple small cloves of garlic, and a mix of 1g of vitC and 0.5g baking soda.

So my question is did you (or someone you know) have a same problem and manage to fix it and put cholesterol under control?",2023-11-17 12:30:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/17xe0vn/any_supplement_to_fight_hereditary_cholesterol/
17rv4a5,Supplements,NAC experience has been a life changer,"So about 3 months ago I decided to take things more seriously about my health and started taking supplements. i eventually settled on a multivitamin, NAC, nmn, fish oil, TMG, taurine and magnesium. 

From all the supplements I added nothing has had the effects like NAC. I take 1000mg of NAC starting about 2 months ago and the effects were night and day in my life. 

I have always been a heavy marijuana user, needed coffee every morning, ate tons of junk food, and drank a couple six packs a week. I was also kind felt annoyed by things all day. 

The first night I took NAC, the next day I honestly thought I had the flu. Suddenly everything just slowed down. And I felt like I was a bit hungover. 

The following weeks were a miracle in my life. Suddenly the urge for smoking just‚Ä¶ stopped? I stopped eating sugar, didn‚Äôt feel the need to drink and lost 25 lbs in a month. The hunger that I used to feel all day just disappeared. I was finally satiated. 

I could run and read books again. Cannabis use can dull or stop dreams but since I stopped smoking I am dreaming deeply and sleeping fully and waking up at 5:00 without an alarm and being able to go on long walks. Further boosting my mood. 

In the days I don‚Äôt take NAC, there is a clear difference. The all day hunger returns and the the anxiety comes back and I feel the need to smoke. I started running again after 5 years off and it feels like I can just keep going and going. 5 years ago I struggled to run 2 miles without getting pain in my sides and out of breath. Now I don‚Äôt get out of breath and no side pains and can run for 3 miles. 

My wife said it was like a light switch. And I agree. Our relationship has really improved as I am full of calm when situations that used to irritate me arise. 

Anyways, just wanted to share my experience here because I would have never tried it without reading Reddit. I know it‚Äôs probably not just one supplement that helped, but it‚Äôs just my take from trial and error that NAC calmed my mind. I sometime try days without it and the irritability returns and I get restless. I will keep alert and see how things progress in the coming months but wow, never had such a positive effect even after trying multiple prescription anxiety, antidepressants, etc.",2023-11-10 03:30:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/17rv4a5/nac_experience_has_been_a_life_changer/

143hbdc,Supplements,Why do supplements have so much Vitamin B3?,"The US RDA for Vitamin B3 is 16 mg for men.  The Tolerable Upper Intake is 35 mg for men, which is just barely double the US RDA.  For some vitamins, you can consume 10 or even 100+ times the US RDA without being concerned about overdosing.  Vitamin B3 is NOT one of them.

At the same time, it's incredibly easy to get enough Vitamin B3 from food.

Even if you're a diehard junk food junkie who regards McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Cholesterol as being as essential to you as fruits and vegetables are to me, you'll still easily get enough Vitamin B3.  Is anyone in the developed world (who is NOT anorexic) at risk for pellegra?

Yet there are B complex supplements and multivitamins that have well over the US RDA for Vitamin B3.  After you add in Vitamin B3 from foods, exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake is inevitable unless you're on a crash diet.

There are also Vitamin B3 supplements with many times the Tolerable Upper Intake.

I don't get it.  Why is it so normal to blow through the Tolerable Upper Intake for Vitamin B3?",2023-06-07 16:07:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/143hbdc/why_do_supplements_have_so_much_vitamin_b3/

yuwgbq,Supplements,Helping me heal myself - to fair price,"Hello!

Woman in forties here.

I live in a country where the health centers have a very hands off attitude, where they would only help you if your life is in imminent danger or is very clear and easy to treat. They don't care about quality of life, and they don't care to find out correct diagnosis etc.

I have verified hypothyroid (I have went to 6 different drs to finally get medication) and take Euthyrox and Liothyronin (synthetic T4 and T3) as well as verified PCOS.

I have issues with pain in the skin on my body. It is not visible on the surface.

I also suffer of depression. (managed slightly with bupropion, though hating the tension headaches I am getting. I have a bad experience with SSRI so I won't go there.)

My blood test for B12 vitamin returns in the 150-200 range pmol/L, and that when I am taking many different kinds of B vitamin supplements from various different makes and also combinations.

If I forget to take some I get this vibrating feeling in my legs. Could also be iron levels.

They say it is within normal ranges.

I also always get slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation levels, no matter. (slightly elevated being slightly outside of range, the cutoff range is 20 here, no matter age/gender.  I am hovering at 25-30.)

They say it is normal for some people.

I have been living in a home with mold and moisture damage, and I have moved from there (since 3 months).

I take daily brisk walks (best to my ability) and I am eating a normal range of food, with very low amounts of so called junk food.

But I feel I am not recovering as well as I should. The healthcare providers haven't prescribed any kind of medication or treatments, saying that I will recover soon enough.

Do you have any suggestions of supplements I should consider to take?",2022-11-14 11:26:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/yuwgbq/helping_me_heal_myself_to_fair_price/

my main issue - i cant eat 2000-2500 a day eating normal healthy food (not referring to mc donalds or junk food / protein bars as a cheat, you get me).

was wondering if there are healthy bulking / or just protein powders so i can grab those extra calories if needed?

i've noticed that along the vitamins and minerals they have a lot of sugar or its alternatives, as well as some chemical substances i never heard of.

w71vml,Supplements,Best herb or supplement for preventing kidney damage?,"Also what would be a natural supplement or herb that if you had chronic kidney disease it could help a lot?

I heard that diuretics that help you pee are good for both the urinary system as in preventing UTIs as well as maintaining overall kidney health and well being.

Im not very well versed on this topic so this is why Im asking here, what in your opinion is the best with the least side effects, that preferable also has a fair amount of **scientific** backing behind it.

A few months ago I had a urine test but doc said I didnt have any issues. Also ultra sound pretty much everything was okay but Im planning on doing some blood tests as well cause there might be more that went off notice during the ultra sound. Anyway Ive noticed some minor pains on the right side of my abdomen so this is why I try to take extra steps to avoid having problems. Keto and fasting somewhat helped but fasting also skyrocketed my uric acid and gave me some gout attacks , but ive managed to pee it out even tho I had some problems urinating which make me kinda scared. I have a somewhat of a recurrent problem urinating the water that I drink where in the past I peed it immidiatelly and it was crystal clear. Anyway losing weight does increase uric acid I already drink a shit ton of water but cant pee a lot also my pee is not transparent these days despite. Which make me kind of worried. Ive been working out hard on both diet and exercise for years and I never had any junk food in the last 3 years. My goals are longevity rn I wanna priorities my kidney health since I've noticed some weird stuff

So far here's a list of things I heard from a lot of people as well as doctors and experts say help:

cranberry products

lemon juice, citrus fruits

magnesium citrate, potassium citrate

chanca piedra

artichoke extract ???

Vitamin K-2 because it takes calcium and puts it in the right places and by this it helps prevent calcium concentrations in the kidneys. For me this would be really beneficial since I dont get any K-2 from food sources and the closest thing for me to K-2 is probably feta cheese but it only offers around  11 micrograms. I very rarely eat animal liver, or chicken heart or

antioxidant berries like cranberry or bearberries in form of juice or extract

and some even mention NAC which is widely known for its antidepressant effect as well as liver protective effect. So im not sure if it does anything about the kidneys but it has a lot of evidence in terms of its benefits. Hopefully someone can enlighten me on this one. How does NAC benefit kidneys? But since NAC is short for N-Acetyl-Cysteine my worries are that it could cause high cysteine levels.

(Update: I just found this diamond which shows good news in terms of kidney stone preventation [Modulatory effects of N-acetylcysteine on hyperoxaluric manifestations in rat kidney - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18423961/) )

I wont list montgomerry juice or anything like that cause I already got a supplement called  ""***Natures Aid Celery Seed Complex with Montmorency Cherry, Burdock & Nettle""***

I take it twice a day as it is recommended and it has  400mg of each of these elements.

Anyway that is my list so far. I could add more but so far Ive been overanalyzing things a little and I wanna ask someone's help in finding the best supplement or herb.

qdfsyi,Supplements,Interesting results after taking Magnesium Bisglycinate and Vitamin D3 for the first time,"I started this combination as I had heard that they're helpful for Anxiety and Depression. I took 200mg of Magnesium Bisglycinate and 1000 IU of Vitamin D 4 hours ago. I had been living off of junk food and was previously getting nutrients sparingly. 

The results have been astonishing.

I'm not sure if it was the Magnesium or the D3, but its like I've exited a brain fog. I feel alert, Focused, and calm. I had been taking Benzodiazepines for anxiety, and Adderall for my ADD. One would sedate me, and the other would speed up my brain, but neither made me feel normal.

4 hours after taking these two Suppliments, I feel NORMAL. Not sedated, not speedy, just normal. A fog I didn't even know the cause of (Magnesium deficiency in retrospect) is gone. Like, lifted from my mind. I don't feel Anxious or Depressed, or worried. I don't feel sedated or sped up like I did with medication... I just feel normal again for the first time in over 10 years, and it's beautiful. I also no longer have cold limbs oddly enough.

I also feel a slight amount of nausea and a weird rumbling in my gut, but hey, that's alright. I knew that Magnesium of any form had the ability to cause some GI issues going into this.

This experience has changed the way I look at nutrition forever, and how important Magnesium is. I also feel a bit sleepy, but its good, I need the sleep.

I had to share this.. and I felt like you folks would be the only ones to really 'get it'. I'm going to take a nap now. Thank you for reading. I'll provide further updates later. 

This is incredible. Why didn't my doctor or psychiatrist tell me  about Magnesium?  Wow.

UDDATE 1: After having take magnesium at 6 in the morning,  I'm noticing Nausea throughout the day. Is that somewhat normal?

UPDATE 2: 11 hours after taking Magnesium Bisglycinate, the benefit is still there. The anxiety and intrusive thoughts no longer over power me. Not an ounce of depression or low mood. I'm still thinking very clearly, and am quite productive. I don't have the muscle cramping/muscle pains I always get and my joint pain is gone. I cannot tell you how much of a blessing the mental benefits are. I cannot explain with words how miserable and afraid I was for years... and for the first time in what feels like forever, I feel normal again. After years of being rendered nearly helpless By PTSD, I feel like me again. I feel like I've found a part of myself that had been lost for a long time.
Also the nausea only lasted a few hours, and was probably due to not eating much today. It's much better now. I have to tell everyone I know who struggles about this. It's like a gift from God. That's the only way I can describe it.

Final update: About 37 hours in, I've taken my second dose. Overall I'm happy, because I have no doubt I was magnesium defficient. I take it before bed with Vitamin D and in an hour, I'm ready to sleep. The only downer is that I got the Webber brand, which has been outed for cutting it with at least 40mg of the Oxide form. Thus, I'm getting somewhat of an uncomfortable laxative effect. On the upside, that sort of takes care of my chronic constipation. Overall, the brain fog hasn't returned, and mentally, I feel a lot better then I had. The anxiety has reached manageable levels as well as thr depression. I'm able to socialize better due to the sum of these effects too. I'm glad I took a chance in it.  Now, I just need to find a more reputable brand that doesn't cut their Magnesium Glycinate with Oxide. Any suggestions?

g7oqvy,Supplements,Suggestions for someone transitioning to getting more fiber?,"I'm aware that drastically shifting fiber intake tends to disagree with the body (when I ate cereal, I had to mix Froot Loops with Cheerios to avoid the stomachache from Cheerios). Thus, I want to know how I can slowly transition from getting virtually no fiber in my diet to having *something* like what my childhood used to be.

I pretty much only eat junk food, because other foods I try to get into only last about week or two before I'm bored of them. I also have an issue with money and food - I've been raised not to ""waste food"", yet my mother is constantly ""be healthy! Eat fruit and veggies!""... but when I eat a fruit or veggie I don't like, she gets mad about wasting money. Even with my own money, I'm very cautious on what I get, because I don't want to... you guessed it, ""waste money"". Thus, my only safe space is with junk food (corndogs, fast food, etc.).

I've considered consulting with a nutritionist when this pandemic is over, but until then, I'll have to do this on my own; so I've decided to start by tackling my bowel movement problem (I tend to eat greasy/cheesy foods that cause my stomach problems), and my main questions are:

&#x200B;

* How much fiber should I start out with, for how long, and at what intervals should I increase intake?
* What are some specific foods that could get me started without causing my stomach too much trouble? I know this will mostly be up to my discretion, as I'm sensory-sensitive(?) and certain foods are intolerable for either that reason, or they cause my stomach problems (celery and string beans, for example)
* What supplement would you suggest for someone starting out? I suppose the same few questions in the first bullet would apply here, as well.

This is going to take time from me, of course, as I'm not used to including other foods in my diet unless I'm having a craving, and with the whole ""wasting money"" mindset I have to unlearn.

1ln9b85,healthyeating,From a devastating diet to an healthy entrepreneur enjoying a healthy life,"I've come a very long way to get here. I struggled so hard with my eating habits. When I say bad, it was actually super bad (I was on a cloud believing I was doing just ""fine"" as everybody else in my little town). I couldn't stop myself from eating the worst junk food you will ever see! It got so bad that I was even eating family party bag sizes of chips in bed. I was gaining weight and I was only blaming stress and anxiety! All of this felt almost normal! I wasn't blaming myself until I got a ""hard wake up"" appointment with my GP telling me that I urgently needed to lose weight as I was close to getting long-term health issues due to my obesity and terrible health habits. My doctor told me ""This has to stop NOW! You aren't realizing how bad you've gone too, are you?""

She was very harsh (my GP), but it was the kind of wake-up call I really needed. Since that day, I started looking at options day after day. I couldn't eat anything and suddenly, for the first time of my life, I started fasting as I just couldn't see food in front of me. When I say food, I mean junk food as this was the only ""food"" I knew till then. When I grew up, I was raised with donuts, chips, hotdogs, double cheeseburgers (without the lettuce and tomatoes), and that's all. To me, this was food. Until I opened my eyes wider and noticed so many ""new"" horizons opening closer to me.



Wow! Life can be very shocking for some of us like myself! Really? What are vegetables? Of course, I heard and saw a few of them in my childhood, but I never had some on my plate! It wasn't the kind of food that would be welcomed at home. Yes, I was shocked when I tried eating differently. I then started a master's degree in nutrition. And then, just months ago, I started an app that made all of what I am now possible! I know, this story is a bit long, but it feels like a relief to describe my journey!



Now, if you're curious to try the iOS dietician app I co-built, you can try it here - it will become the number one in a few months. If it did work for me, so it can work for you! I really hope your diet isn't as bad as how my diet was, then, you are welcome - [https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854)



I‚Äôm here to help, and let‚Äôs prioritize our health before it‚Äôs too late. I hope you‚Äôll take action sooner than I did, avoiding the false reality I was trapped in.



Either way you decide to try the app or not, I hope this post is helpful. Consistency and discipline are crucial!

1leujz1,healthyeating,Help With Water Additive Alternatives?,"I am looking for an alternative to what is probably my worst habit. I rarely drink plain water. It is just . . . plain. For years now I have been using the drink mix additives to water for the taste. I keep seeing that the sugar substitute in them may not be the best for being healthy. 

My favorite flavored additive is an energy mix but I like the taste more than the caffeine. It tastes to me just like the watermelon Jolly Rancher candy. I drink three or four of them per day. [Watermelon](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Energy-Electrolyte-Watermelon-Limeade-Liquid-Drink-Mix-Sugar-Free-1-1-oz-10-Packet/734373480) I do enjoy other drink mixes and none with added caffeine. I also drink cold brewed sweet tea although I do not make it as sweet as the commercial stuff.

I don't drink soda/pop. No alcohol. I don't smoke (never have). No drugs. Red meat maybe once a week. I do not eat out. No fast food. I rarely eat anything that could be considered junk food or heavily processed. Cholesterol is good. Blood sugar is good. Blood pressure is good. Exercise is good.

I think I am generally pretty healthy except for not being able to drink plain water. Am I worrying about it too much? Does anyone have suggestions on what I could have besides the drink mix additives?

Thanks for the help.

I've struggled with my diet for years! It's very hard to stay consistent. And even harder to know what's actually good for your body. Why is X junk food and not Y??

This is why, 2 years ago, I decided (with another nutritionist) to take a drastic but risky and expensive decision! We built a radical nutritional iOS app. As of today, it has already helps over a thousand people to be aware of what they eat! This is incredible! And this is just the beginning of the journey!

1i5ja8v,healthyeating,healthy eating surrounded by junk,"I live at my parents house, with my 2 siblings who are food junkies. My parents are the type of people to give my siblings whatever they want in order to lessen any conflict (eg. my siblings yelling). This has led to them eating aleast 1/2 pizzas every day, and most of the food in our household consists of junk food. I am able to ask my parent for healthy food and buy it on my own, but it seems like I am not able to maintain healthy eating simply because the house seems to be cluttered with junk food. Also, my parents and family encourage me to eat the food they eat often, and ask to go out to restaurant. If I refuse, it usually results in them getting mad, or making some weird argument that I can't eat healthy food all the time because it's not good for my immune system (these same people believe that pizza/ice-cream is somehow good for you).

I mentioned I have the ability to buy foods I want to eat, but I simply can't willpower my way to heathy eating when my environment is only surrounded by the 'junk' foods I also like (and believe me, I've tried). I do not want to become the product of my environment, but it seems right not that's the path I'm taking and I'm just not sure what to do anymore.

1hltoz6,healthyeating,The simplest way ive found to cut sugar from my diet,"Have a rough plan of what you will eat for each meal  
  
For example, I know for breakfast ill have yoghurt with granola, for lunch ill have fried eggs and for dinner ill usually have whatever my mum makes  
  
Outside of this for snacks ill have fruit, dates with peanut butter or ice blocks since its pretty hot right now  
  
This removes indecision, which is a massive cause of eating junk food, also my having these 3 healthier meals your more satisfied which makes you less hungry for junk food. Even if you have junk food your too full to have that much, limiting how much sugar you end up having  
  
Right now, make a rough plan of what you're going to eat tomorrow, and follow it for at least 1 meal

1hlbjip,healthyeating,How i gained the self control to stop binge eating junk food,"Its been a whole year since I've put a packet of Oreos on my desk   
  
Why?   
  
Up until early this year, i struggled with eating junk food  
  
Whenever id get access to junk food I would eat the whole packet of chips, whole box of biscuits or 4 ice cream sticks in a row  
  
In summary I could never moderate my eating habits  
  
Thats why since this time last year I put one my favorite foods, Oreos on my desk right in front of me to get me used to saying no to the decision to eat junk food  
  
This helped me immensely in being conscious of the thoughts i get to eat junk food, and over time decrease how much i feel like eating junk food in the first place  
  
I realized this when we had a box of Lebanese sweets at home and for one of the first times, i didn't finish the box as soon as i got it  
  
I realized I could actually moderate how much I was eating and not eat to the point of feeling sick  
  
This wasn't a result of having a smaller appetite, rather it was from having practice not binge eating when i get access to junk food by sticking a packet of Oreos right in front of me for a year.

I say almost because I do get sweet cravings still, especially for coldstone ice cream. But nowadays, usually on and off, my body and brain just decide to reject any fast foods or junk food aside from chips/crisps, or more sweet things like cakes and chocolates. My dad stopped by and got me some McDonald's and we got to hangout for a while, and I was hesitant to eat the McDonald's because I just didn't want any part of it. I didn't want to be rude of course, so I ate the fries, ate some of the burger, and drank some soda and said I wasn't all that hungry but still thanked him. Shortly after taking a bite of the burger my body just felt HORRIBLE. It felt like my intestines were on fire( exaggerating), and I almost wanted to vomit it back up. But whenever I eat roasted potatoes or salads my body feels amazing again. I'm not fighting my body on what it wants at all. If it wants anything healthy I'll happily eat it so long as it's available at my local grocery store. Now I'm craving less sugar. If I have a sweet craving I usually just stick with Medjool dates, strawberries and honey.  Usually my go to snack now.

1caelpq,healthyeating,"Rate my diet (18M, 178cm, need to bulk)","When I was little I always had a very low appetite and there were days where I was ""able"" to eat a single moderate meal+when I started working out I had a chaotic workout program, not having a single pause between sets (chest->back->legs, repeat), that insane cardio and that low calorie intake (they surely were days where I had under 1000kcal per day) led to me having very little mass. October 2023 I had only 54kg, I tried donating blood but wasn't able to, I had already tried bulking for the past year to some extend, but that event really hit a spark in me.

Fast forward, I really ate a lot per day, not necessarily a good, diverse diet, but it still was lot, so much that there were several days when I was feeling like vomiting, and I currently have 59kg, although at the beggining of 58kg the progress got really, really slowed. Point is, things with a lot of calories from simple sugars REALLY affected my overall mood and thinking for certain periods, for that reason, I limited my simple sugars to strictly natural sources, occasionally honey. I also remarked that junk food which contained MSG, unhealthy fat and others additives made me crave them into more, temporary impairing my thinking and clearance of mind.

Apart from sugar and addictive additives which I already know created cravings, therefore impairing my clearance of mind and mood, I started feeling in a lot of horrible ways, and I suspected it was from some kind of vitamin deficiency. I started taking a lot of supplements (feeling that especially Omega-3 and Ashwaganda helped the most) and concentrated more on taking protein after work-outs and having a good amount of protein per day.

My ""plan"" was this, please critique it as much as there is to critique:  
So, apart from high-calorie junk-food, eating to gain weight would also mean getting more body-fat, which isn't what I really wanted since I barely made out of the skinny-fat problem two years ago, plus I run, a lot, so more body fat wouldn't benefit me too much. I researched about what happens with extra-protein and when would it be considered ""extra"", and I drawed the conclusion that while my first interest was to gain weight, I would rather like not gaining useless body fat while feeling horrible and then do a cut, but just increase the muscle mass. Muscle density is higher than body fat density, therefore my overall volume can be the same, but with more mass. Therefore there are several days where I take 100g+ of protein per day, usually the days when I work out, even though it can be just 2 sets.

Currently, I am happy with my diet of 2000kcal+ per day, 80g of protein+ per day, no junk food and no added sugar, also no feeling horrible for whatever reason, but is it enough, is it too much, and can it potentially lead me to any long-term problems?

Diet:  
-daily  
2-3 eggs in the breakfast with varying type of bread, alternating the cooking oil with EV Coconut oil, EV Olive Oil and animal fat if available (sometimes with dill, parsley and tomatoes)  
50-100g of nuts per day (either pure nut butter from almonds, cashews and hazelnuts, either simple nuts as snacks, including pumpkin and sunflower seeds)  
600ml-800ml of milk per day/kefir  
50g of whey protein/casein (with added bromelain and digestive enzymes)  
50-100g of sorghum porridge  
2g of grounded cinnamon (in the protein shake)

-some times per week  
meat, mostly poultry, rarely red meat  
fruits, especially bananas and citrus  
teas, mostly white tea and other real teas, occasionally herbal  
cereals and wholegrains other than sorghumchia seeds  
any kind of cheese  
honey in coffee or tea

-some times per month  
potatoes (in any way)  
chicken soup, usually with organs  
if in need of flour to cook something, chickpea flour  
mac and cheese with a personalized mix which includes nutritional yeast  
mung beans  
white rice  
whatever my parents make me, usually meat with some kind of side dish with legumes or pasta

Supplements:  
Omega-3 (daily)  
Vitamin D (daily)  
Multivitamin (C, E, B1,2,3,5,6,7,9,12 , Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, Selenium) (sometimes per week)  
Ashwaganda (daily)  
Chlorella (I take 1-3 times per week, to detox the possible heavy metals from the diet or supplementation)

I drink a lot of water daily, also I have no digestive problems, the digestive enzymes, kefir and sorghum porridge takes care of the hardship of digesting fats.

Is there something I am missing in my diet? Will I have any long-term problems with the current diet I have?  
I saw that what I mostly spam for calories has the negative impact on weight gain, leading to other types of problems, but does it apply when I was severely underweight to begin with?

I am aiming for 63kg btw, and would like to continue using other healthy methods.",2024-04-22 16:04:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1caelpq/rate_my_diet_18m_178cm_need_to_bulk/

One example, I was a bar/grill/restaurant for a kids party tonight and I found myself wishing that I was having a couple beers and a plate of fries and mozzarella sticks or something, like grilled chicken sandwich, whatever...

It's like I just want to join them, but I am unhealthy and I need to avoid this kind of junk food. It's crazy how driven I am to eat unhealthy food and I think it's ruining my life.

I drink 3-4 litres of water a day, stay away from processed meat and junk food (except for Friday takeout/chocolate). I also take Zinc and collagen supplements in the morning, and after dinner I take a vit D and Omega 3 supplement. 

Just doing this with no exercise since January I've lost over 50 pounds, but I'm curious how nutritious and healthy this is, and what I can do to improve it. I could probably do with more variety in lunch and the veggies I have at dinner, but I'm a very picky eater so some healthy foods like chick peas, tomatoes, onions etc are off the table for me.",2022-11-01 08:20:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/yj2tnc/how_healthy_is_my_diet/
yiwjyf,healthyeating,First year college student - advice,"Asking for advice (a bit of a rant) from a first year college student struggling with food situation on campus ‚Äî 

I have been vegan for 6 years now, and generally eat pretty healthy. I love to cook and normally eat a lot of veggies, beans, rice, tofu etc. however it‚Äôs been really hard in college because I don‚Äôt have access to a kitchen and the dining hall food sucks. I‚Äôm pretty physically active so I need to eat a lot to feel satisfied but there aren‚Äôt so many options. What I‚Äôve been doing is eating salads at the dining hall and having oatmeal, pasta, and beans in my dorm room to supplement (I do have a microwave). 

The thing is, I am used to having large portions of healthy satisfying food and I don‚Äôt really have access to that here. So I‚Äôve been eating a lot of protein bars and chocolate which I hate because I don‚Äôt want to be eating all this added sugar. I feel like I can only feel full if I eat a couple of energy bars but they‚Äôre basically junk food, not to mention expensive. 

Sometimes I am so hungry that I just eat the dining hall prepared food and feel like crap for days. (I don‚Äôt have food sensitivities but I am attuned to my body and know that I feel gross after eating food that is overly processed or has weird shit thrown in.)

So what would you suggest? Hopefully I‚Äôll fix my living situation and stay in a place with a kitchen next year. But for now I only have a microwave. I‚Äôd really like to stop eating protein bars and cookies etc because I have some genetic health issues I‚Äôd like to minimize my risk for, but so far this is the only way for me to not feel hungry all the time.",2022-11-01 02:41:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/yiwjyf/first_year_college_student_advice/

xdf16g,healthyeating,How poor sleep can wreck your eating habits,"*I'm an editor at The Washington Post and we just published a story about the correlation between sleep and nutrition.* 

*Health columnist, Anahad O'Connor writes:* 

People who are sleep deprived experience changes in their brain activity. Studies show that when a person misses out on sleep, the region of the brain involved in pleasure-seeking and reward [responds more strongly to junk foods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3883872/) such as candy, doughnuts and pizza, creating more powerful urges to indulge in fattening foods. And sleep loss [causes decreased activity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6344438/) in other parts of the brain that regulate food intake, making it [harder for people to exercise self-control](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3259). 

One trial found that when people slept just [5¬Ω hours a night over a two-week period they consumed an extra 300 calories a day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2615460/), mostly from snacks such as pretzels, cookies, chips, ice cream and candy. St-Onge analyzed many of these trials and concluded that, on average, people eat between 300 and 550 calories more on days when they are sleep deprived compared with when they could sleep seven hours or more.

Don't count my calories but eat until I am full between 12:00-20:00. I don't restrict my fat intake and use butter and olive oil as much as I want in my meals.

I feel healthier overall but: I had 2 vacations during this time period. In my vacation I'd let myself eat my forbidden foods and consumed junk food such as McDonald's, waffle and icecream etc. And I was surprised that all these days my libido has increased greatly. Now, compared to those days I feel like I have much lower libido. In terms of erectyle function, I can't say that there is much difference but I think of sex or crave for it much much less compared to 2 months ago and those vacation days. Is that normal?

Generally I avoid slimy things, leafy foods (both damp and dry), and other things with rigid or '3D' textures (e.g. raspberries, strawberries).  This has made it incredibly difficult to have a healthy as I avoid foods generally associated with healthy eating (such as salads, raw fish and fruit).

I don't eat a lot of junk food or processed foods generally, but I'm wondering if there's recipes I can try or different foods I haven't found yet which are still giving me the right stuff without being too yucky for me.

Eating that much trash actually got me in a horrendous state, not to mention i barely was physically active, so i started to change, probably the best choice in my life, from 220 lbs to 175, but with not a very good strategy, and i'm aware of it.  
From over-eating, to barely even eating anything, and probably i'll still be doing it for a while, i got what i wanted, i lost weight, but at what cost? But none of that matters now because i want to change.

Someone my age is meant to eat 2000 (If not higher) calories a day, but how am i supposed to not gain weight because of eating 2000 kcal a day?

Guess I can't get away with the cheese tho lol, but I try to avoid the ultraprocessed ones and go for the leaner types. I also love pizza and enjoy making it from scratch, dough and all. When I'm too lazy, I just buy the dough disks from my local baker, who has a very traditional recipe, and bake them at home. I looove pasta and I usually cook the sauces from scratch. Same thing for cakes (though I'm way more into salty than sugary foods), pancakes, etc. I mostly prefer water/juice over soda, but will have a can of coke every now and then (like once a week or so).

I try to avoid ultraprocessed foods as much as I can by always reading labels and focusing on getting things with the least amount of ingredients in them. But yeah, I love me some pasta, burgers, fries and the like.

I'm not overweight and I feel healthy - though I am aware I need to step up my exercise routine, which since the beginning of the pandemic basically consists of walking the dog twice a day lol.

1lc87bs,keto,I‚Äôve successfully entered ketosis. Was 200lbs now 150 (5‚Äô9‚Äù 34 male),"
When I hit 33 years old, I had a bad stunt with junk food and experienced rapid weight gain from 130 pounds to 200 pounds probably within about five or six months. 

Part of this was due to depression from unemployment and living on stimulus money, we all have our excuses, but that is my trek into being overweight or nearing obesity.


About four months ago, I started doing some moderate exercise and doing some diet changes by cutting out any white bread and sugary drinks. Part of this is due to some symptoms I was having with my bladder, and I was trying to figure out what was causing this. 


I also decided to try the factor meal service and order many options that were high in protein, low in carbohydrates and high in saturated fat.  I‚Äôve started ramping up my walks from 4 miles a day  to 5 miles a day to 6 miles a day. I average two hours of intense to moderate exercise per day.

I‚Äôm mixing that with one factor meal and maybe some chicken in the morning or an egg or two or a smoothie. 

My energy levels are the highest that they have ever been, and I can tell that my bladder issues have been alleviated by losing the weight in my abdomen area, although my doctor is somewhat concerned because I experienced rapid weight loss within months. 

When I had a urinalysis done, it showed that my ketones were above 80 md/dl, but my glucose and blood sugar levels were normal and showed no signs of diabetes or pre-diabetes. I also had a test a year ago showing that I had no diabetes.

But my AST and ALT dropped by almost 15. I went from 49 AST to 31, which I am positive is due to these positive health and lifestyle changes I‚Äôve made.

My liver is better functioning that it was in my 20s for reference. 

I think ketosis is beneficial to the body and moderate exercise mixed with a high protein Diet is a great recipe for better health and weight loss.

1kwzaro,keto,Rant: Criticizing my lunch as Unhealthy.,"Today I pull out my foster farms turkey cold cuts and cheese from the fridge, put it on a plate to take to my desk. My coworker walks into the break room and comments ""That processed turkey is so unhealthy for you.""  I'm like, so were criticizing Turkey cold cuts in the healthy category now?

I said, ""Dude you had a turkey sandwich last week!  This is the same thing without the bread,"" and he grumbled ""well... thats why I don't eat a lot of sandwiches.""  I'm like, but you do and bullshit I see what you get for lunch.  By the way, he's eating fucking bag of \*Lay's potato chips\* as I write this.  Should I walk over and say ""Dude, those lays are so unhealthy for you?""

I don't normally eat a lot for lunch at work so to make it easy I just get cold cuts from the supermarket or Costco, some cheese, and make a few roll-ups.  Basically a meat/cheese sandwich without the bread.  Sometimes throw a little mustard in there. But people just lose their minds when it isn't between two unnecessary pieces of bread.  If it was between two slices of bread, he nor anyone else would blink an eye or say anything.

I don't really get worked up over this.  I'm used to it having done low carb or Keto on and off for 20 years.  I just wanted to share because I am sometimes dumbfounded when people apply double standards to food.  I'm sure I'm not alone in when it comes to people being strangely fascinated by my lunch and whether or not it qualifies as a healthy meal to them, but we never talk about their lunch which is often definitely not more healthy.  Like these same people go to In-n-Out and get a meal with fries. If I go get a lettuce wrap burger it's suddenly ""keto is an excuse to eat junk food.""

To be clear, I'm not saying processed turkey is healthy. I'm saying it's not anymore unhealthy than what everyone else at work is eating or you know, just any turkey sandwich.

I have that one coworker that's keto.  I actually turned him onto Keto 10 years ago and he's the poster child for sticking with Keto.  He walks in the room and he gets it. Sometimes we trade tips for lunch like he was emptying a tuna can into a bowl and mixing in packets of mayo.  I said, ""Why didn't I think of that?""  He said, ""Normally I do turkey like you, but I have cans of tuna in my cube (for shelf life) as a backup for when I forget. I just use the mayo here in the kitchen.""

Once I started doing keto, cutting out junk foods (thereby cutting out wheat) - I was and am a changed man.

I have more focus, drive and energy to live my life, build my businesses and do what I always wanted to do.

I'll be honest I regret not knowing about this earlier, my younger years were somewhat wasted due to battling these health issues and I couldn't live like a normal person, I've shed a tear or two recently over how much time was lost with unknown issues.

But I look forward to the future - thank you Keto, you've been great to me.

1jhfyij,keto,"3 months keto: 25 lbs down, more energy, and cravings gone","I just hit the 3-month mark on keto and I'm down 25 lbs (210 -> 185). I feel amazing compared to before. My sugar cravings are basically zero now (wild, because I used to inhale sweets daily).

I started keto to tackle high blood sugar (I was prediabetic). The first week was rough‚Äîketo flu had me feeling awful. But I upped my electrolytes (broth, salt, magnesium) and by week 2 I felt a ton better. Since then, my energy has been super steady. No more 3pm crashes at work, and I just feel ""level"" all day, if that makes sense.

On the weight side, 25 lbs in 3 months is faster than any diet I've tried. I know some was water at first, but my clothes are looser and people are actually commenting that I look slimmer (love that!). Beyond the scale: my skin has cleared up, and my blood sugar readings have dropped back to normal range. I just feel healthier overall.

I've been keeping net carbs under 20g/day. Tracking everything I eat has been key. I use Meal AI to log my meals by snapping a photo, and it gives me the calories and carb count (so I don't accidentally go over on carbs). It also tracks my fat/protein so I can make sure I'm getting enough of both. Sticking to my macro targets has definitely helped.

I honestly thought I'd miss bread and pasta like crazy, but surprisingly I don't. If I do get a craving for something non-keto, I either find a low-carb substitute or just tough it out. Not having those sugar spikes and crashes makes it a lot easier to resist junk food.",2025-03-22 19:04:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jhfyij/3_months_keto_25_lbs_down_more_energy_and/

1ihl9u1,keto,"One month on keto, a reflection","Hello, I don‚Äôt know how long this will be, I don‚Äôt really expect anyone to read it, but thanks if you do :3¬†

I started keto on 01/01/2025, as a New Year New Me diet. I started on a bit of whim and have been learning as I go. I‚Äôve been aware of keto for years and have experience tracking food so it wasn‚Äôt too difficult.¬†

So far, I‚Äôve been staying under 21g net carbs a day and eating between 1200-1500 calories. Honestly, I haven‚Äôt been too concerned about calories, but I‚Äôm finding it difficult to eat over my goal without spending ¬£¬£¬£. My heart yearns for an all beef carnivore diet but that is not realistic in this economy (or for my health probably lmao).

Over the years I have dieted many times. I lost around 80lbs in 2018/19 doing regular CICO, but had gained 40lb back by the time I started keto. I just didn‚Äôt have it in me to restrict my diet and have had a huge problem with binge eating since I was a teenager. My diet before consisted of a lot of high calorie snack foods that would fill me up so I didn‚Äôt eat many actual meals, which stopped me from gaining too much weight (I‚Äôve never been over my highest weight since losing those 80lb) but still! Not good! Not healthy!¬†

On keto I‚Äôve been eating two meals a day (lunch and dinner), sometimes with a snack between meals or after dinner, but not always. I am rarely hungry and don‚Äôt have much food noise anymore. I definitely miss the foods I can‚Äôt eat, but I don‚Äôt crave them, and don‚Äôt feel the same unstoppable urge to binge that I felt before. The closest I got to feeling this was when I bought some 100% baked cheese snacks and ate 3 bags in 3 days. The calorie hit wasn‚Äôt so bad, but I didn‚Äôt enjoy the out of control feeling so I need to be more purposeful when buying snacks like that.¬†

My start weight was 125.2kg. Since January 1st I‚Äôve lost 10.2kg!! The first week I lost 5.3kg which is crazy. I‚Äôm only weighing once a week because weighing daily causes too much mental strain.¬†

I can‚Äôt quite believe how easy keto is for me. I really enjoy this way of eating, and haven‚Äôt gotten bored of any meals yet. I‚Äôve been eating way more vegetables than I did before keto on keto because having to restrict them is making me try and find a way to include as many as I can in every meal. I‚Äôve been eating so much cabbage‚Ä¶ I really love cabbage‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve also been eating kimchi (more cabbage) every night with dinner and it slaps every single night.¬†

Keto is also doing great things for my bank account. I spent about ¬£100 less on food this month than I did in October (random month I picked to compare). I haven‚Äôt ordered any takeout which used to be such a crutch for me. My weekly grocery bill has been considerable more expensive, but then I‚Äôm not buying takeout or snacks from other shops, so it works out cheaper overall. And I‚Äôm eating super well!¬†

It‚Äôs hard to know if the changes in my body/mental health can be attributed to keto or if it‚Äôs New Year New Me Disease or simply because I am not longer eating so much junk food or another, secret, thing, but I am feeling much better day to day. I feel bright and alert and am being very productive when it comes to keeping up with Life Admin (something I am very bad at usually). I‚Äôd really like to be able to keep this up because it‚Äôs so nice to feel this way.

Overall, I‚Äôm having a great time with keto. I‚Äôm not being too strict on myself and enjoying the process. It feels a lot more relaxed to me than diets I‚Äôve gone on it the past, which surprises me given how little I‚Äôm eating everyday and how much temptation there is around me (I still have Christmas chocolate leftover, which I will probably re-gift).

One thing that I am anticipating is eating out for the first time on keto. Depending on where I go will dictate how difficult it is. For instance I know my regular breakfast spot with be easy because a full English can be made keto with a few easy alterations vs eating in a regular restaurant (I am the baby of the family and never pay for my food so would feel bad ordering something expensive like steak lol).¬†

Carnivore is Destroying My Gut & I Don‚Äôt Know What to Do Anymore

Hey r/keto, I really need some insight because every time I try carnivore, I suffer. I don‚Äôt mean mild ‚Äúketo flu‚Äù stuff‚ÄîI mean serious, intense pain that leaves me feeling like something is seriously wrong.

For context, I‚Äôve done very strict carnivore multiple times, and each time, something extreme happens to my body:
	1.	First time: Ended up in the hospital because of intense stomach pain.
	2.	Second time: Had some milk, and my body nearly shut down‚Äîfelt like I was about to pass out.
	3.	Now this time: Intense upper stomach pain that‚Äôs throbbing, twisting, and won‚Äôt go away.

What‚Äôs Happening Right Now
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm currently 42 hours into a fast (about to extend it for 12 more hours with just water & tea to see if it helps).
	‚Ä¢	The pain started as light menstrual-like cramps, but then it moved UP into my upper stomach and became throbbing, twisting pain.
	‚Ä¢	It feels like a rock is sitting in my stomach and won‚Äôt move.
	‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs rumbling/vibration inside, but no sharp stabbing pains, just constant throbbing pressure.
	‚Ä¢	It feels worse when I drink coffee or artificial sweeteners, but I need sweeteners to push through my fasts.

What I Suspect Might Be Happening

I‚Äôve been considering a few possibilities:
	1.	Artificial Sweeteners Destroying My Gut?
	‚Ä¢	I usually tolerate a lot of artificial sweeteners, but I‚Äôve noticed that on carnivore, my gut gets way more sensitive.
	‚Ä¢	I recently had psyllium husk (fiber) with artificial sweeteners + added even more sweeteners on top.
	‚Ä¢	My gut might be fermenting everything weirdly because it‚Äôs not used to processing non-meat stuff anymore.
	2.	Gastritis or Acid Issues?
	‚Ä¢	The pain feels deep in my upper stomach, almost like my stomach lining is irritated.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee on an empty stomach might have worsened things.
	‚Ä¢	Sweeteners like sucralose & aspartame are known to mess with gut bacteria and the stomach lining.
	3.	Bile Flow / Gallbladder Issue?
	‚Ä¢	Carnivore is high-fat, and if my gallbladder isn‚Äôt releasing bile properly, my digestion might be struggling.
	‚Ä¢	The pain doesn‚Äôt feel sharp or gallstone-like, but I know bile stagnation can cause digestive backup.
	4.	Intestinal Gas / Blockage?
	‚Ä¢	The pain moves around slightly, which makes me think maybe I just have a bad case of gas or slow motility.
	‚Ä¢	But I‚Äôve done carnivore before, and I never had this level of discomfort just from gas.

My Plan Right Now

‚úÖ Extend my fast for 12 more hours‚Äîonly plain tea and water (no sweeteners, no coffee, no psyllium husk).
‚úÖ Try deep breathing & belly massage to see if it helps move anything.
‚úÖ Cut out artificial sweeteners for the next few days and see if things improve.
‚úÖ Reintroduce some light foods after fasting (maybe plain yogurt + eggs) instead of jumping straight into heavy meat.

üö® BUT if the pain gets worse, sharper, or I start vomiting, I‚Äôll get medical help.

Why the Hell Does This Happen to Me Every Time I Do Carnivore?

I‚Äôm just sick and tired of every time I try carnivore, something extreme happens. I see people on here thriving, and I want to lose weight & stay low-carb, but my body is making it so damn hard.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve done strict carnivore before, so I KNOW it‚Äôs not just an ‚Äúadaptation‚Äù thing.
	‚Ä¢	Every time I try, my gut rebels in an extreme way that doesn‚Äôt happen when I eat junk food, sugar, or even high-carb diets.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúketo flu‚Äù or ‚Äúelectrolytes.‚Äù It‚Äôs real digestive distress, and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

üëâ Has anyone else dealt with this? Did you fix it? Should I switch back to keto and slowly transition instead of diving into strict carnivore again? At this point, I‚Äôd rather just be able to function than keep going through this hell.

Any help would be appreciated. I don‚Äôt want to quit, but I can‚Äôt keep suffering like this.",2025-01-29 14:02:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1icufbp/help_dont_want_to_end_up_in_the_hospital_again/

Hey everyone. I'm two weeks into keto. I think I'm finally starting to get out of the brain fog. I have lost about 11lbs since I started. I'm also combining keto with a 20hr fast and 4hr eating window. Last time I was dieting I gave myself 1 day a week for cheat day. I'd like to be able to have a cheat day on keto but of course stay in ketosis. I know the point is to not eat all the keto junk food but I stay quite strict with only eating whole foods throughout the week. Does anyone else do a cheat day? Also what are some of your favorite keto snacks for when you do ""cheat""? Also thought I'd mention this. A couple years ago I tried Ozempic. Damn, keto combined with intermittent fasting is more of an appetite suppresant than that ever was! The last few days I've had to force myself to eat passed the point of gagging just to get in 1500 calories.

1hty1vk,keto,Keto with a toddler?,"I realize I should talk to a doctor/pediatrician about this, but I'm curious if anyone here has any experience in this area. 

 I'm a single mom of an almost 1.5 year old, and so far she eats exactly what I eat most of the time. I've been wanting to try keto, but I have read that it isn't safe for small children to be in ketosis. 

My goal isn't to initiate weight loss for her, but if she eats what I eat and ends up having a more high fat and low carb diet, will that negatively affect her? I realize I can add more carbs in for her and not eat them myself, I'm just not sure if she ends up having too much fat or some sort of unintentional imbalance if that could be a problem?

All of this being said, I realize it is difficult for toddlers to have a balanced diet in general. As is, she gravitates towards fats (cheese, eggs, avocado, full fat yogurt, things like that), veggies, and fruits. So I'm just wondering what considerations I should be taking into account if my own diet changes drastically and its affect on her. Generally we eat pretty simply, some sort of meat, veggie, and carb like bread or rice or pasta. I just binge eat sugar and junk food when she's sleeping or not looking.

1h02lkk,keto,Why we get fat: a theory,"Hi all, Fognox here. I've been doing keto for close to 9 years (one month to go) for general health reasons. At my biggest I was 300lbs and I dropped down to ~210, which I've been maintaining. 

The subject of this post is something I've been thinking a lot about lately. I've gone way off keto a few times recently, and didn't gain weight. I don't gain weight when I'm keto and binging dirty keto. Why *on earth* did I gain so much weight in the first place, particularly when I was a decade younger and more active? 

I have a theory around this that's been sort of crystallizing lately that I'm going to try to put into words with this post. It'll probably be very long -- feel free to tl;dr and downvote it. 

**Some backstory**

I was a skinny teenager. Like many skinny teenagers though I didn't stay that way. All through my 20s there was slow but steady weight gain, hitting obesity at age 23 and reaching my peak weight of 300lbs at age 27. My diet wasn't particularly unhealthy through all of this -- definitely not the ""everything is a superfood"" thing it is now, but I leaned somewhat vegetarian, ate a lot of vegetables, used whole wheat bread, rarely ate desserts. Things spiralled a bit out of control in 2014-2015, but most of the weight gain didn't happen when I was living on fast food. I was also physically active through a lot of that -- manual labor jobs + periods with lots of walking. I had periods of time where I was sedentary, but I've been sedentary for the last five months and I haven't gained weight. 

In late 2015, I went keto. Weight went way down, health went way up. There's been bumps in the road of various kinds since then (looking at you, 2020) but taken as a whole I define myself as being keto for 9 years and having maintained a 90lb loss.

**Hunger and satiety**

By far the biggest change between my 2015 body and my 2024 body isn't the weight loss, it isn't the complete lack of what used to be chronic heartburn and indigestion, it isn't even the massive increase in mental focus. The *most* noticeable change is to hunger and satiety signals. 

On keto while sedentary I'll go a few hours before my first meal of the day. My second meal happens around 7-9 hours afterwards. I don't eat the rest of the night. I might sometimes snack in the middle there, but if I snack too much all that happens is I'll skip dinner. When I'm not eating, it's not because I'm ""not hungry"", it's because I feel as satiated as I felt right after I first ate. As a result, I don't ever think about food unless I'm *very* hungry. 

Before I went keto, this definitely wasn't the case. I physically *needed* 3MAD, and usually snacks along the way too. I was hungry when I first woke up so I'd eat first thing. Snacking sessions definitely didn't replace meals. I'd constantly think about food, even if I had just eaten. 

Whatever this hunger/satiety effect is, it carries over even when I'm *not* doing keto with one notable exception. Drink a sugared soda for something different? No change. Go past the threshold for low carb with chocolate? I'll skip dinner. When I usually do this I still have keto as my baseline diet. There have however been periods of time where I've been forced to eat a standard diet for days at a time, and the hunger comes right back. That makes me think that the standard diet is the actual problem.

**Changes to the standard diet**

My mom was born in the early 60s. When I was a kid, her concept of healthy eating was the four food groups that she had learned back then -- get your meat (or other protein), your dairy, your fruits/vegetables and your grains. When I was growing up, this had morphed into the food pyramid with carbs at the bottom and meat/dairy at the top, but she hadn't bought into it.

Over time though this food pyramid idea seemed to take over more and more of the standard diet. Cereal for breakfast makes sense according to this standard, despite the lack of meat/vegetables. Spaghetti without meat was acceptable (because meat is at the top of the pyramid anyway), etc. 

It changed further with more and more emphasis on carbohydrates and low-fat, low-meat diets. These kinds of diets have always been around, and the connection between fat and heart disease was around back then, but I don't think these ideas really shaped the standard diet until later. If you walk around a grocery store today you can find tons of products that boast of how low in fat they are -- zero-fat ice cream, turkey bacon, fat-free ham, etc. This kind of thing just didn't exist when I was growing up. Same deal with the wide variety of meat-free alternatives -- veggie burgers were around but vegan cheese and vegan burgers sure weren't. People did vegan diets, but they weren't mainstream, even in the general vegetarian community which *itself* was not mainstream. 

The formulation of processed food has also changed *completely* -- with milk chocolate for example you'll see things like skim milk + vegetable oil, rather than whole milk covering both. Ice cream almost universally uses skim milk. 

And then there's the carbs. If you're new to keto, it's often shocking just how much food you can't have. Deli meat and cheap hot dogs have starch in them. Processed eggs have flour of some kind in them. Taco Bell has carbs in basically every single ingredient, which becomes really clear when you look at the nutrition facts. Walmart chili without beans has *more carbs than protein*. You're trying to eat food and instead you're eating cake. 

**The food your body needs**

So what is food really?

There are three main macronutrients -- carbohydrates, protein and fat. There are others (like alcohol), but I'm not trying to be pedantic. Macronutrients are basically calorie sources.

Of the three, only carbohydrates aren't required. If you don't eat enough protein, you die. If you don't eat enough fat, you die. If you don't eat enough carbohydrates, you evidently can live for at least nine years. This is because in addition to being a calorie source, protein and fat have structural uses in the body. Your body can make all the carbs it needs from protein and the glycerol backbone of fat.

Usually in health circles, the talk is around micronutrients -- the vitamins and minerals that your body needs, and how low this is in processed food. While this is true, protein and fat are equally as important, if not more so over the short term.

What happens when you have a diet where the food is high in the nonessential macronutrient and low in the two it actually requires? It's tempting to say ""chronic health problems"", but the body is smarter than that. If there's an unlimited amount of that food available, it makes sense to just eat more of it to get that essential protein and fat. 

Let's say you need 100g of protein per day. You're hungry, so you go out and get a McDonald's Big Mac combo meal. That comes out to 1100 calories so it should tide you over for half the day, right? Well, there's only 30g of protein in it, so you'd need to eat three of these throughout the day to get your protein, coming out to 3300 calories. On a 2000 calorie weight maintenance plan, that's weight gain.

Could be worse though. What about a taco bell beef burrito? It has beef in the name, surely it's high in protein, right? Well no, each burrito has 12g of protein and 430 calories, so you'd need over 8 of them, netting you 3500 calories in the process. 

So okay fine, fast food is bad. We know this. Let's eat healthy instead. So you pick up, say, this:

https://www.target.com/p/healthy-choice-caf-233-steamers-frozen-beef-teriyaki-9-5oz/-/A-26398567#lnk=sametab

Look at all that meat! It even just looks healthy. You look at the nutrition facts -- huh. 14g of protein. Well you could eat more, and sure enough if you do that you get adequate protein with only 1928 calories. Not bad! Except.... Remember where I said that there are *two* essential macronutrients? Well all those ""healthy"" lean cuisines add up to give you only 29g of fat, which is below even the mainstream 50g recommendation. So you could add more I guess, except wait, on a 2000 calorie diet where's your wiggle room? 

**Making it worse**

As bad as these numbers are, the standard diet situation is actually *worse* -- 100g of protein is a pretty low estimate, but the main issue is that this strategy assumes you're even trying to maximize protein in the first place.

If you're eating, say, pancakes for breakfast, you've already eaten a bunch of calories with very little protein, which means your meal choices over the rest of the day are going to be even harder. And this isn't a conscious strategy, it's your body's strategy. 

With the food pyramid idea, meals that are almost pure carbohydrates make sense -- you are after all trying to maximize them. Meat and dairy are important, but they're at the top of the pyramid -- basing your meals on grains is vital. 

**The hunger cycle**

When you eat like this, if you're overweight and you know it, you fall into what I call the hunger cycle: 

* Eat ""healthy"", getting enough protein without too many calories -- you're low on fat, making you hungry for it.

* Binge on fast food or junk food, getting enough fat -- you get lots of extra calories in the process, making you gain weight.

Rinse, repeat. 

Or you give up altogether on trying to eat healthy because of how hungry it makes you and while you're not hungry, you're rapidly putting on more weight.

Or you white-knuckle yourself through a healthy diet, lose a bunch of weight and then eventually at some point the lack of fat catches up with you and you break. Losing weight becomes this impossible struggle against your own hunger, and you think something must be wrong with you, because you're getting plenty of protein and vegetables, right? So why are you hungry?

Or you just eat a standard diet full of normal things like chili and deli meat (on whole wheat bread) throughout your 20s and notice a slow and steady weight gain over time and you can't figure out why. ""I guess I'm getting older"", you think. 

There's nothing wrong with you, carbs aren't even a problem in themselves, the *diet* is to blame. But.....

**Let's talk about sugar**

While it isn't explicitly required for obesity (looking at you, 2020), a high sugar intake is heavily paired with it. But why? Sugar doesn't inherently make you obese -- everyone knows someone who only drinks soda and has been rail-thin all their life. Sugar is tied to metabolic disease, but there are plenty of people that have a sweet tooth but are metabolically healthy. What's really going on?

From the outside, if you don't have an issue with sugar, it looks like people just can't control themselves. Over a long long period of time on keto I've become one of those outsiders -- I can eat a good bit of it without it triggering anything, though I'll usually eat very small amounts (like one cookie) or avoid it altogether. But I haven't always been this way.

Back in 2012 (around the time that I had ballooned up to obesity), I realized that I was drinking too much soda. I didnt have a concept of weight at the time (250 was weird but I didn't feel fat yet) but I was having other issues related to it. I decided I would *cut back* -- to only six cans of coke per day. For reference, that's 234 grams of sugar. That was my *goal*, *God only knows* how much I was getting back then. Cutting back to 234 grams of sugar was *really hard*, and eventually I failed altogether.

I'm currently on the outside looking in, but it wasn't that long ago that I was on the inside. So I understand it. It definitely isn't a lack of controlling yourself, and the amount of discipline I had to cut back to 234g proves that it isn't a discipline problem either. So what's really going on? Well, I've been a smoker before and it's a lot like that. It's addictive. But wait, it isn't inherently addictive -- not everyone gets stuck in a cycle with it just because they eat a dessert, and also after nine years of keto, something in my body has fundamentally changed and sugar no longer has the same effect. What's really going on?

One of the big pieces of advice I give here for people starting or returning to keto is to quit starch first. This works really well for me, and in fact any of the times I take trips to Carblandia I avoid as much starch as possible. Whatever other nonsense I've done over the last nine years, I've eaten a very very low starch diet consistently (nuts/seeds have some, otherwise it would be almost zero). 

I can't prove it more than anecdotally (and the anecdotes of people I've given this advice to) but my thinking is that because starch keeps your blood sugar elevated for longer periods of time than simple sugars, it's more likely to crash, and the crashes are what drive sugar addiction. 

If you go back to what modern food is made out of, it's overwhelmingly catered to starch. Remember the food pyramid? Starch is the *foundation* of the standard diet. It's way higher than anything else -- a pepperoni pizza has more starch than protein and fat *combined*, despite its popular conception as a ""fatty"" food. A Big Mac has 4/3 as much starch as fat, and 1.7 times more starch than protein. Starch is, after all, where most of those ""extra calories"" are coming from. And it's a nonessential macronutrient.

If you're eating standard food to excess to get enough protein and fat, then you're also consuming gigantic amounts of starch. And this starch keeps your blood sugar elevated for long periods of time, so much so that your body has to adapt itself to the high carb intake, making the crashes worse. Introduce some sugar into the mix, and it's a good fix for those lulls. Over time it's more than a band-aid though and becomes part of the problem, driving your sugar needs higher and higher. Eventually the lows are so bad you decide you need to cut back to 6 cans of soda per day.

While sugar can be a problem in itself, my point here is that it's more of a symptom. Excessive starch will *also* cause insulin resistance, and a standard diet based on products and the food pyramid where you're not perpetually hungry will cause you to eat excessive starch. Cut sugar out without changing that and your lows will be *awful*, worsened by your budding insulin resistance. 

Not everyone goes that way, but the food pyramid way of thinking is still in transition. 75% of America is overweight or obese and that number seems to still be climbing. Health officials will point fingers at processed food or oils or will double down on low-fat diets and prescribe plant-based ones, but Ketoers have lost a total of 708,705 lbs on keto. 

It's clear that emphasizing *both* protein and fat and reducing the nonessential macronutrient is key to losing and maintaining weight. With keto you don't have the hunger associated with low-fat """"""""""""""""""healthy"""""""""""""""""" diets, but you're not piling on the calories either. So you don't need fast food or junk food to get your fat fix, and meanwhile the lack of starch gives your pancreas time to heal. Carbs are not the enemy, but they shouldn't be your best friend either. You don't get fat because you lack control, you get fat because your body's just trying to survive and it's the *food and health industries* that lack control. At least in this theory.

**Conclusion**

If you've made it this far, I encourage you to leave a downvote because I'm using ""theory"" colloquially and this is actually a hypothesis.

My son noticed and wants to follow in my footsteps. 

My 15 year old boy is a freshman in high school and is starting Varsity Offensive Tackle. He's roughly 6'4"" 320lbs. Pretty muscular for his age. He's a beast, but he thinks keto will help him with athleticism, make him faster not having to lug around so much weight, and he has his mind set on wrestling in the off season, which, if I'm not mistaken, would require him to be under 240lbs to compete. I'm sure he could stand to lose a good bit of weight without losing any strength or explosiveness. 

Should I let him do it? It wouldn't be easy because school is always trying to feed him junk food, but I believe he has the willpower to do it right. I could help prep his meals, snacks, etc.

1f4mw3o,keto,I beefed it real bad. ,"This mostly my own personal accountability post and a bit of a rant. I got a job working police dispatch. During training it was heaven. I was able to eat on my schedule at scheduled times, and maintain my Keto through and through, people were stunned when i said i was up to 373, then down to 238. But then, once training ended, i got stuck on overnight shifts. The stress of listening to people die, scream and yell at me, etc. The constant working at different hours. I wasnt able to maintain my mental health, and i started to binge eat again, or even worse, just stuff my face with junk food. Since then i ballooned to 340 at the end of my career there, and resigned. Ive been sedentary for almost 6 months plus the two years i worked there.   

  

Then I thought, maybe a personal trainer would help. My trainer pushed me too hard. I landed in an ambulance because i could hardly breathe, and my body seized up. When i arrived at the hospital i was finally able to move around again but i was tired. They said it was dehydration and hyper-ventilation which put me into a state of nearly fainting but not quite.   

  

So i became even more sedentary, now im scared of exercising and i know its stupid but i just cant shake the memory of being on the ground so helpless, feeling the weight of the world on my chest, and thinking that I genuinely ate myself to the grave.   

  

So now where am I? I enrolled in university, the first week is over for me, i commute an hour each way, sometimes longer if there is traffic. A lot more walking because the campus is large, with stairs. Though shamefully i take elevators when i feel tired. Im trying to restart keto and be low carb again. It worked one time, it could work again. My doctor himself said since it worked for me the first time i should try it again, then once i get back to my goal weight we will get a dietitian on board to get a smooth transition off keto and onto a sustainable path to no longer binging, and re-evaluating my relationship with food. 

  
I know not a lot of folk care. Shit, I hardly care, I feel so apathetic. I feel sick. Even now 3 days into starting up again im terrified my sodium intake is too high, or my carbs are too high at 40 net, or im gonna eat too much meat and have a heart attack, etc. so forth. I know. It probably wont happen. And worst case, Factor meals exist, and they were really good and fit in macros, and when i had labs done, all my shit was good 

  

For the first time, i went to my docs office stressed about my health. My weight. My blood pressure was up, but normally its fine so they said we'll check again in 3 months with some weight loss and keto changes. But man. Its hard. Im depressed to a degree, but not like suicidal or anything. Im just sad that I cant control myself, i know its all mental but the energy just isnt there some days. But im gonna try again, Im gonna try and get there again, I liked the way i looked admittedly looking back in pictures, I just didnt see it in the mirror.

1dj1icx,keto,Struggling with other people in house,"So I am the only one that is keto in my household- my husband and child are not. I did really well for 1.5 years. I lost 100 lbs. for 6 months I have been struggling with a few days on and off ‚Ä¶ with a consequence of gaining about 13-19 lbs. I‚Äôm trying so hard to be strong but we all know‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt easy and I have messed up. I‚Äôm getting myself back on track but my husband (who needs to lose 100 lbs) is buying more junk food than usual and even put donuts under my nose last night. He bought in the last grocery run‚Ä¶ 6 bags/boxes of chips and donuts, cakes and cookies - leaving them out on the counter for me to walk by. 

I‚Äôm getting upset. I have never bashed him for his food choices. I encourage him to eat some veggies occasionally- he wants to lose weight but refuses to do anything to help himself. I am struggling to have to walk by all this junk all the time. 

I‚Äôve started fasting 20 hours instead of only 16. This helps with some of it mentally because the longer I go without eating the less hungry I get. (I get hungry once the fast is broken- then I struggle until bedtime with eating). 

I really want to get back down to where I was or even lower. I was very sad when I had to buy size 14 pants this week as I have gone up from a 10. 

I am petrified of gaining more. At my heaviest I was 285 and could hardly walk. I lost 110 lbs and gained 75 back. I then got strict and lost 100 getting down to 150. I have watched the scale creep up to 170 this physical year. I‚Äôm trying to fast more and watch my diet and am 163 today. 

I don‚Äôt really know why I am posting. I guess I just need to vent - or maybe I know I need to write this for my own accountability. It‚Äôs hard to be the only one that watches what I eat. He really is a great man. I know he is likely jealous that I have lost weight and he hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve encouraged him to try keto but excuses. I know I can‚Äôt say anything to anyone that will make them change. It is an individual decision and mindset and he must become ready for change. I love him dearly and am just venting. I want him to grow old with me.

1c2hfnc,keto,My experience with keto (long),"I started keto in February, 2023.  It was basically a last ditch effort.  14 months later, I absolutely cannot believe the difference it has made.

First, some history.  I'm male and in my 50s.   I have been on so many diets in the past, I have lost count.  I have yo-yoed from weighing 160 pounds to 250 pounds probably about six times in my life, which I realize is extremely unhealthy.  I can't imagine what I have done to my body.  I tried everything.  First, it was Slimfast, then Medical Weight Loss, then medically supervised Optifast, then simple CICO (still SAD) type diets.  Often, I would include exercise regimens alongside the diet.  After ending each diet, I would always go right back to my old ways of eating, which included multiple trips to the vending machines, cookies, cake, ice cream, chips, pop, candy, fudge, etc.  I have always been a sugar addict.  It triggers me and I can't stop.  It might as well be a drug to me. 

I would often fall asleep in the middle of the day at my desk at work (private office, but still).  I had untreated sleep apnea.   Going up and down stairs was a joke because I had to do it sideways while holding onto the handrail.  And then I would get winded, just by going up one flight of stairs.  I couldn't bend down.  I remember trying to get something out of the bottom of the vending machine at work and I couldn't crouch.  I had intense leg pain, the worst being in the morning.  The last straw was being with friends for Christmas and unable to put my shoes on because I couldn't bend my knee enough.  I knew I had to do something.  But there had been other things happening, too.

I thought I had plantar fasciitis because I had worsening foot pain that would not go away.  I made an appointment with a podiatrist and she took x-rays and told me I had a bone spur on my heel.  I remember thinking at the time, wow, now I know but it will never get better and I'm going to have to learn to live with it, or get surgery.  

I had been getting more and more skin tags under my arms, dozens and dozens.  It was so embarrassing.  I would get them removed, only to have more show up in a few months.  Also, I started developing what is commonly called ""barnacles"" on my back (medical term is seborrheic keratoses).  They just showed up all of a sudden and looked extremely freaky.  Add to this the fact that I always had dark spots under my arms, on my elbows, and on my knees (acanthosis nigricans) most of my adult life.  I just figured I was genetically predisposed to this condition.

My skin was so oily, if I didn't wash my face mid-day, it looked like I was wearing vegetable oil by the end of the day.  Acne came and went, and in the weirdest places.  Again, Just figured this was due to genetics.  My eyesight was worsening, which again, I figured was due to genetics and/or getting older.

Lastly, I had triglyceride levels near 400, and high blood pressure that was often 150/90 and sometimes higher.  Even with medication, things were not getting much better.  

And then I started keto.  I used MyFitnessPal (free version, I know it is limited) to religiously track everything.  I set my macros to 5% carbs, 25% protein, and 70% fat.  I let the app set my daily caloric limit after answering its questions.  I don't recall getting the ""keto flu"" but I was taking extra electrolytes.  I think it took about five days and then I started seeing the scale move.  I know it was water in the beginning but I never strayed from the diet and the pounds kept coming off.  I was excited.  But, I wasn't expecting other benefits.  And did I get other benefits.

First, the leg pain that I experienced every morning began to subside, probably after two weeks.  Maybe a month later, I was able to fully bend down and crouch.  I didn't have to go up and down the stairs sideways any longer.  In fact, I could now run up and down the stairs.  I think it was another month that my foot pain was gone.  Like, how could that happen?  I was told I had a bone spur on my heel.  Didn't seem to matter.  By summer, after having all of the existing skin tags removed, they stopped coming back.  They're completely gone, as in no trace, no scars, nothing.  I had my ""barnacles"" frozen off and they haven't come back.  However, there are traces of them for which I'm getting laser therapy (it takes a while)  The areas where I had dark skin (acanthosis nigricans) have cleared up and look normal now.  My sleep has improved immensely.  I can now sleep through the entire night and I'm told that I no longer snore.  I'm not falling asleep during the day.  My skin is no longer oily looking.  The acne flare ups are *mostly* gone.  At my latest eye exam, my prescription actually went down (i.e. my eyesight improved).  How does that happen?  My triglycerides are normal.  My blood pressure is lower but not yet where I want it to be (130/70, sometimes 125/65 ).  I have a high ""pulse pressure"", which means I may have atherosclerosis.  Not sure how to fix that.

But the BIGGEST benefit so far has been my mental well being.  I'm no longer depressed.  I feel really, REALLY well.  Like, I'm happy again.  And I haven't felt like this for a very long time.  I don't have any junk food cravings.  I can watch other people scarf down whatever and I have absolutely no temptation.  I can't believe it.  I am close to my goal weight (within 15 pounds) but I let myself plateau before the holidays last year because I didn't want to keep lowering my daily calories (I was starting to feel hungry more often).  When I'm ready, I'll do what I have to do to get rid of the last 15.

I don't ever want to stop doing keto.  It has changed my life.  I'm usually very private and would never normally share this much info.  I did in hopes that someone considering keto will give it a chance and, hopefully, end up with a similar story.  It isn't just about losing weight.  It affects our whole body, including our minds.  I don't think of it as a diet anymore.  It's a way of living...better.

And I noticed my energy improve, my focus improved (it felt like my life long ADHD went away), My sleep improved, and every month I lost 10 pounds like clockwork. In one year I lost 120 pounds, last year (2023) I was able to loose another 30. I weight 203 pounds now, I'm not in a big rush to keep pushing the scale down. Although my goal is to one day be at 175-185, I have so much energy now that I starting to go hiking everyday in the mountains near my home with plans to backpack with my friends here soon. Being as active as I am now feels almost impossible 2 years ago. I would get out of breath just walking around the block...

I started keto to lose some weight, but I'm staying keto because it makes me feel superhuman! Regular people don't know what it is like to not get tired all day from a carb crash. Or how your ADHD might be linked to too many carbs (just a hunch). Keto changed my life, I wish more people understood what this was like. But I'm sure you guys in this community know what that's like. üí™

43/F/5‚Äô4‚Äù. SW: 220, CW:171, GW: 130-ish

I‚Äôve ballooned to about 220lb a few years ago and I haven‚Äôt been exercising or watching what I eat. We took a trip that had a small private plane tour and I apparently had to pay extra for being overweight. That was a wake up call. 

Slowly started losing weight, got down to 197. Started really watching my diet about 9 months ago. But then mom got sick (ended up in the hospital with DKA as a t2, among other issues including undiagnosed cancer) and passed away within a week. I fell off the wagon for a bit, overindulged on soda, junk food and sweets and got diagnosed with t2 diabetes in October (which weirdly I think ‚Äúhelped‚Äù with weight loss, in a bad way). A1c of around 11. Freaked out, cut out all sugar and starch. 

Went full keto mid October, and have been since. Blood sugar is mostly controlled now, aside from an occasional bad decision, dirty keto/fruit. A1c of 7.4 as of January 5th, and expected to be under 6 next go around. Started walking more. At least 45 minutes a day, in 15 minutes intervals, walking the dog around a few blocks. I need to really start adding some strength exercises but it‚Äôs still hard to get motivated, even with the results I‚Äôm seeing. 

I still have a long way to go, and sometimes the scale just won‚Äôt budge. I don‚Äôt have those ‚Äútypical keto‚Äù I‚Äôve dropped 30lbs in the first month results, but it‚Äôs still progress. Just keep on keeping on. It makes a difference, clothes are fitting better and people that don‚Äôt see me every day are starting to notice.",2024-02-19 16:45:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1aurv88/weight_loss_journey/

I have a friend who is almost 1 year postpartum too, eats like shit (only junk food), never cooks, never ever exercises (I swim 3 times a week), and yet has gotten her post partum weight OFF almost entirely. 

I KNOW I KNOW I SHOULDN'T COMPARE MYSELF TO ANYONE. I KNOW. but...and hear me out....isn't it frustrating? like I exercise, I eat clean (even before keto I always cooked at home and was mindful of my eating), and yet I am fatter than her.

101dmdx,vegetarian,"I‚Äôve been a vegetarian for 7 months now, and I‚Äôm struggling a bit.","When I say I‚Äôm struggling, this is what I mean:

- lots of junk food
- I cant cook well
- I‚Äôm underweight

I‚Äôm a 17 y/o vegetarian living with non-vegetarian parents. They cook food, and before, I would eat it, but I really can‚Äôt now because everything they make has some form of meat. Steak, stroganoff, etc.

I myself am not a good cook. I can make one pasta dish, and that‚Äôs about it. Every other thing I attempt to make comes out bad (usually tastes wrong, I have no idea how to season things).

I eat a lot of hot pockets, pizza rolls, pb&j sandwiches, and I‚Äôve always been the kind of person to want to be eating constantly (usually snacking on pretzels or chips).

The thing is, I‚Äôm underweight, just a bit. Growing up, I‚Äôve always been skinny and you would think it‚Äôs amazing (and sometimes it‚Äôs good), but people will always say I look anorexic, and as you might imagine, that made me insecure. So I‚Äôve always wanted to gain weight but nothing I try works. Eating more protein doesn‚Äôt help, and most people who eat a lot like me gain weight, but not me. 

Sorry for the rant of sorts, but I‚Äôm just struggling with this. Not with being vegetarian, that‚Äôs fairly easy and I don‚Äôt ever crave meat. It‚Äôs just not having many things to eat, and my parents not teaching me how to cook.

100xosb,vegetarian,To Our New Vegetarians: Here's What to Expect,"Since it's the New Year and this sub tends to get a lot of ""Going Vegetarian as My New Year's Resolution"" posts, I thought I'd let all the new veggies what they can expect from my observations from being a vegetarian for about thirty-five years and watching a lot of people start up with it.

(This is meant in good humor.  To everyone trying this for the first time or trying it again after falling off the wagon in the past, I do say welcome, and good luck with it!)

* **One Week In:** ""This is so easy!  Look at these delicious dinners I've been having!  I don't miss meat at all!  I should have done this years ago!""

The novelty is fun and you're trying new foods and recipes.  Enjoy!


* **One Month In:** ""I feel so much healthier!  I've lost weight!  I should have done this years ago!""

Yep, this is because you're watching everything you're eating and tend to be eating healthier foods.  As with any diet that you stick to, you'll lose weight. Also, when people start eating better, they tend to exercise more.  You might be taking walks, taking the stairs, etc.  But just wait until your digestive system starts objecting to the changes.  That will not have you feeling so great.

* **Six Months In:**  ""What are good restaurants?  I struggle when eating out.  I really miss this one dish, does anyone have any good substitutes?  What should I pack for lunch?  I'm tired of the same sandwich over and over.  Any good recipes for comfort foods?  What are some quick dinner ideas? I have a cookout coming up.  How can I navigate that?""

Okay, the novelty has worn off and you want foods you're familiar with.  You're tired of being ""the vegetarian"" in the group and just want something besides rolls and salad when you're with friends, dammit!  The exciting recipes you discovered six months ago just aren't cutting it now when you're tired after work and just want something quick.  You're starting to miss the foods you love.  This is where we start to lose people.

Warning: This is also around the time that you might get a little self-righteous.  You let everyone know that you're a vegetarian and may feel like you can't be around meat or people eating meat.  Some start pushing their diets on everyone and claim to get physically ill at just the thought of meat (which you were eating until recently).  Be careful.  If you do fall off the wagon, people will never let you live it down.  And you don't want to give all vegetarians a bad name.

* **One Year In:** ""OMG, I just found out that my favorite soup is made with chicken stock!  OMG, gelatin is an animal byproduct?  OMG, there's gelatin in everything!!  Wait, there's beef stock in the ingredients of these veggie noodles I've been eating??  What do you guys mean Caesar salad isn't vegetarian?  It's salad!!  And it's been my fallback at every restaurant!!  Wait, what's that about parmesan?  What's rennet?""

You started out just not eating obvious meats, but now you start learning about all the invisible ""meats"" you've been missing.  And it's all in foods that you've been relying on.  WTH?!?!  Now you have to start deciding how strict you want to be.  And this is probably about the time you were thinking about migrating toward being a vegan.  But how can you do that when you still need to eliminate foods you didn't even know weren't vegetarian?

* **After a Year:**  ""Anyone have some healthy recipes?  What kind of supplements should I be taking?  Anyone else have issues with anemia and B-12 deficiency?""

Congratulations, you've made it pretty far and may stick with this.  But, you're beginning to find that you don't feel as healthy because you've gotten a bit lazy.  You've started to rely to heavily on pastas and breads when you don't feel like making a big effort cooking.  Hey!  Oreos and Doritos are even vegan!!  You start filling up with junk food more and more.  You gain weight.  It may take a bit before you learn to balance things, but it's always easy to slide back to being a very unhealthy and overweight vegetarian.  (For all the teens living with non-vegetarian families, you're in the worst danger of this trap.  I've been there.)

* **After a Few Years:**  You rarely bring it up anymore.

Being a vegetarian is just part of who you are, like being left-handed, or liking to read, or watching sci-fi movies.  You rarely bring it up and *most* people just accept it about you and don't make a big deal about it (yes, there will always be *that* relative, but most people have just let it go by now).  You know how to navigate a menu, do a quick read of ingredients, and you've developed a whole new lineup of foods you regularly eat.  Stick with it and you will get there.

Again, for the newbies: welcome to club.  For everyone else, what did I miss?",2023-01-02 00:05:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/100xosb/to_our_new_vegetarians_heres_what_to_expect/
y17bw9,vegetarian,Burger King Germany deceived Vegetarians and Vegans,"I found out about this a week ago and I'm still so mad about it I need this rant. 

I loved that BK now offered a plant based version for every burger, and they had even received the PETA Plant Based Award for the plant based long chicken. 5 products were certified as vegan, with separate fryers, vegan mayo and everything. Tried several burger, liked them all.

So a week ago, there was an undercover documentary on TV where they sent 5 of their journalists to work at different BK restaurants. Apart from abysmal hygiene and them selling unsafe food (spoilt sauces, meat, veggies, buns) it turned out that quite often, there are mix-ups with the plant-based and meat patties. Stuff is usually fried in the meat fryer (notwithstanding PETA requirements). If they're out of pb patties or nuggets, they deliberately sell regular ones. According to the other employees, their bosses force them to do that as ""people will eat whatever shit you serve them"".

I'm devastated. I know I know, BK is junk food and it's better to cook your own stuff anyway. I did not eat there regularly, but every now and then I really enjoyed the diversity of options and the food. Especially if I am travelling and need something quick and accessible. And now? I keep telling myself that maybe our local restaurant isn't that bad and I surely would have noticed if it was actually meat. My SO usually eats the meat version and it IS different although they look and taste really similar (according to him). But I feel so betrayed. To think you have a great option only to find out they don't care at all and will betray you. My trust is gone, also for McD and all the others, I don't think they will care much more about what they give you in exchange for your money. 

PETA threatened to withdraw all vegan labels if BK doesn't fix the issue within a set timeframe. But I doubt many German vegetarians/vegans will eat there in the foreseeable future. So we're back to french fries and salad to go.",2022-10-11 12:04:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/y17bw9/burger_king_germany_deceived_vegetarians_and/

lnvhlk,vegetarian,[Missed/Changed Ingredient] I am disgusted. I am disgusted with myself and my carelessness. I am disgusted that it‚Äôs in my body and part of my body. I hate myself.,"**(Tl;dr context - scroll to ‚Äúmain issue‚Äù for the actual post)**

When I was a child of around 5-6 I was taken to an urban farm for the first time and saw the animals for myself and I remember finally understanding what meat was, where it came from and what these animals were there for. I was **immediately** disgusted and repulsed. I started kicking up a fuss at home that night over food. 

I grew up in relative poverty for the west. My mother couldn‚Äôt afford food and we got what my aunt and uncle could spare to buy for us. In her own words, ‚Äúthis wasn‚Äôt a restaurant‚Äù and it certainly wasn‚Äôt. My mother would engage in psychological warfare with me when I refused to eat the meat-containing dinner by trying to cook my previous favourite thing or trying to starve me out. It took me around 4 years of strategy (for a 6 year old) into adjusting what she got from the grocery store with my aunt and uncle, cutting out meats one by one and finally fish until I fully became an independent cook and vegetarian when I was 10 and never touched meat again. For the few years before that I was basically only eating fish (very occasionally) or prawns (rarer still) I had few options for meat alternatives. I made do with what I could argue down from until I got what I needed eventually. I consider myself in a way a natural born vegetarian - as soon as I understood what meat was, I found it abhorrent and spent years manipulating my entire family‚Äôs eating habits as a *child* so that I didn‚Äôt need to eat it ever again. 

I succeeded. I have not eaten meat for 19 years. I have a difficult relationship with veganism: for those almost two decades I have been one (a vegan) on and off but to be frank, I struggle. I kick myself about it but I know fine well that I‚Äôm addicted to dairy and it‚Äôs my flaw as a selfish and disgusting human being. I make substitutions wherever I can and limit it but I struggle to seriously remove cheese from my life for extended periods of time. I am what I am and this is who I am.



**Main Issue:**

For a few years now I have been living with my mother for various reasons relating to her health. She often gets herself a frozen meal of ‚ÄúChips and Curry Sauce‚Äù (chips meaning a type of thick-cut potato fries to any Americans) for a late night snack. Here in the UK, chips and curry sauce are a pretty common take-out food that people get from the local place or when they‚Äôre having a night out. It‚Äôs spicy and delicious and goopy and everything you want in junk food. I don‚Äôt eat them myself (the frozen ones she gets) but buy specific ‚Äúchippy‚Äù granules made by *Bisto* that are very tasty and have them on chips, waffles or hash browns (with my kryptonite of cheese) when I‚Äôm feeling particularly in need of some obesity-inducing junk food. 

She‚Äôs been getting them for years and I distinctly recall checking the recipe on the box for anything unacceptable several times but over the years the recipe has changed or she‚Äôs been getting them from one of the other major UK supermarkets. Tonight I was sniffing as she cooked some in the microwave and noticed the star anise smell and went to check the ingredients for what spices were in the sauce...  

**(Chicken Stock....)** 

It‚Äôs a nightmare. I have eaten one of the chips and curry frozen meals myself perhaps once but I very often nibble on what she can‚Äôt finish (for her health reasons) up to half a tray of it. I just realised that I‚Äôve been potentially nibbling on leftovers of something that had chicken stock in it for over 3 years. 

I am disgusted with myself. I am angry with myself for not being more vigilant. I am disgusted that those molecules and nutrients are however small, now part of my body. Being vegetarian for so long, I felt that I had become pure with a body made up of almost only vegetable or (urgh cheese) derived molecules. 

I am looking in the mirror at myself and see a disgusting animalistic pig of a creature and feel utterly devastated and desperate. I was just earlier thinking of how it‚Äôs been almost 20 years for me and I feel utterly ruined. 

Has this happened to anyone else? How did you cope? Sorry if some people don‚Äôt understand and think I‚Äôm being over dramatic but this is a **massive** deal to me.",2021-02-20 01:08:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/lnvhlk/missedchanged_ingredient_i_am_disgusted_i_am/

jps1px,vegetarian,Transitioning from Vegan to Vegetarian,"Hello! 

I (23F) have been vegan for 1.5 years, vegetarian for 7 years prior to that. I went vegan because of environmental and ethical reasons. However, as of recently, I have been thinking about switching back to being a vegetarian for a few reasons: 1) I have a history of anorexia and have found the restrictiveness of the vegan diet really bad for my mental health. 2) I feel like vegan ""junk food"" products, like vegan cheese, are worse for the environment than more locally-made regular cheeses (I'm located in the midwest of the US). 3) I feel like, as a vegan, it's much harder to participate in events with food involved. If my friends are having pizza, it's no fun to not be able to join them. I also dislike having all of my friends' choices of restaurants and whatnot be determined by whether or not they have vegan options. 

That being said, I feel SO BAD about even thinking about eating dairy. I'm not interested in eating eggs and I would still eat like 70-90% vegan, but it's so difficult to deal with the anxiety and guilt around eating dairy a small number of times per week. I also know that my stomach will be totally wrecked from eating dairy lol. Have any of y'all dealt with going from vegan to vegetarian? How did you handle the negative thoughts, especially concerning ""failing"" being vegan?

Something I noticed: despite consuming identical amounts of nutrients, I found myself almost always hungry while on this diet of chickpeas, lentils, beans, oats, veggies, etc. 
And as a result, my cravings for junk food SKY ROCKETED. At the end of the day, my body would act like I hadn't eaten all day, and at that point in the night all I could think about was cookies and chips.

This could become a serious issue for someone who eats vegetarian all the time, unlike myself who just did it for a month.

Then I started eating more veggie junk food like the chicken nuggets, mac and cheese, spaghetti, etc. I'd maybe have one serving of vegetables every other day as opposed to multiple per day. This is mostly because I was in college but I've been out for almost a year and I think stress is catching up to me too, and I crave those quick meals. This has been my diet the last year or so.

I should add, I try to drink about 60oz of water per day and more when I exercise, I generally am around 45oz a day. **But I work with preschoolers and can't run to the bathroom every hour.** which sucks!

Hey there! Since I was a freshman in high school (about 5 years ago maybe?) I quit eating red meat. No more pork or beef. I have since then only eaten pork or beef products maybe five times, not including any products that I was unaware had pork/beef in it (such as Maruchan ramen, which I recently looked at the ingredients on the soy sauce flavoring and saw beef extract in it). 

However, I am having a LOT of trouble giving up chicken and seafood entirely. I wanna try doing this one step at a time, such as week one = 1 day without meat, week two = 2 days without meat, with eventually only the occasional poultry or seafood, and then finally almost exclusively vegetarian.

What can I do to reinforce my motivation/determination and keep me on track?

I eat processed foods from time to time (like veg burgs and other meatless options, and some junk food) but for the most part I eat rice, beans, and vegetables.

And my drug habits have been like that for the past 2 years or so. It‚Äôs only when I stop eating meat that I get these stomach problems.

I thought it was an interesting take, in that I think that any steps taken to step away from factory-farmed meat are worthwhile.  I also appreciate people who don't bury their heads in the sand in regards to the meat they eat, and are aware of and participate in the process of where their food is from.  I also liked the point that if you don't change your meat spending habits, but just buy better-raised animals, you reduce meat consumption automatically.  Plus the knock to your wallet is actually reflects the real cost of producing meat, from the added feed and water inputs to the environmental ones.

 But, on the other hand: it definitely didn't score any points from me for talking about how having meat in your diet makes you way healthier--maybe if you live off refined carbs or are some other type of ""junk food vegetarian"", but not if you eat a variety of healthy vegetarian foods.  And down the article there's a picture of one of the butchers holding a cute piglet in a nice looking, well-lit farrowing hut.  While the sows in crates (!) are neatly faded into the background.  Maybe farrowing crates are marginally less bad than gestation crates, but if the quarters you keep your pigs in are so close that these are necessary to prevent piglet death you've already failed in humane, ethical farming, imo.  I also thought it was kid of disingenuous to talk about how corn and soy are damaging the environment when a majority (or at the very least a significant minority) of these foods go to feed livestock.",2019-08-08 16:13:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/cnnwj4/the_vegetarians_who_turned_into_butchers/

azc3s0,vegetarian,Semi Rant - Need Advice (Longish),"Hey all

&#x200B;

A few years back I was suffering from random depression and migraines. After a while of up's and downs I've found out I'm allergic to dairy, heavy dairy, I can get away with small amounts of milk light cheese and anything cream basically shreds my head. I've also recently discovered it's highly likely I have Celiac disease, If i eat Gluten I get scarily near enough instantly depressed. 

&#x200B;

I decided Originally to go vegi then into vegan and now i'm a weird mix of Fish eating, dairy avoiding, NO Gluten monster. Problem is my 'Gut' is in a crazy bad state, I'm on random hits of Esomoprazole for Gastro enteritis which I discovered very late was causing a Vit B and Magnesium deficiency. I've had problems with Vit D deficiencies too.

&#x200B;

Which leads me to my problem, The reason I don't eat meat is two fold, i'm not actually against the whole killing animals for food. It's more the environmental factors (Meat being an incredible waste of space, literally, It's so in-efficient as a food source it's annoys me.) and that it can be incredibly dangerous when cooked wrong. I eat out / eat food that I've never seen the source, It just got into my head one day that so many people potential morons are touching something that i'm about to consume. If it's not cooked right, if it's got something wrong with it etc... 

&#x200B;

I'm coming to a point now where I'm suffering a ton of health issues related to diet. Genetically my family don't see grey hairs till 45+ yet all of a sudden I got a ton of gray hairs, I get weird cravings for food. No one can leave a chocolate bar near me, it's not the taste or being hungry it's a feeling I get telling me I'm missing something. It's not consistent either so i'm guessing it's some form of Vitamin I'm not getting enough of my weight is growing but i'm eating more healthy then I ever have avoiding meats and junk food etc... I should mention I quit smoking 4 years ago now which didn't help my stomach issues as I was eating everything in sight.

&#x200B;

I've also had trouble 'absorbing' things. I get random bouts of not drinking enough water. I'd get headaches and dry mouth constantly feeling the need to drink yet no matter how much i drank It just wouldn't absorb properly and I dunno I just worry that my body is doing the same with any Vitamin supplement i'm taking

&#x200B;

For those of you who have thought that my diet is lacking as I am underweight, I eat healthy with vegetables, fruits, seeds, eggs, other meats like meat sticks (of various different meats), and whatever foods you would see a typical North American eat that is not fast food, junk food, or any dessert. I also take some minerals and vitamin supplements (zinc, iron, copper, vitamin D & C just to name a few) as my father kept suggesting that I take them (he also thinks I am underweight but he has barely even seen me under my shirt and I do not live with him, so he does not know my lifestyle well (I live with my mother)), plus I wanted to see if they would affect anything, and I believe they did end up helping a bit. The only thing I am unsure of right now is whether I am eating ‚Äúenough‚Äù, I feel that I eat a lot of food, but some foods have more calories and different nutrients than others and I do not record those metrics.

\[ORIGINAL POST STARTS BELOW THIS, EDITED/ADDITIONS ARE ABOVE THIS TO NOT GET CONFUSED\]

I am a 16 year old male (height about 6 foot or 6‚Äô 1‚Äù), I used to have a skinny-fat body and weighed around 195lbs at my peak, currently weight about 135-140lbs with a considerably defined body and have visible veins across my forearms, shoulders, arms, and even my legs a bit. Have been training since January of 2024. I also run too, it used to be nearly impossible for me to jog even a kilometre, and now I can jog (much faster than before, almost running speed) for almost 5 kilometres whilst only breathing through my nose, and yes it is extremely uncomfortable and exhausting to breathe out of my nose whilst jogging and running for an extended period of time but once I run for a couple minutes I enter some kind of ‚Äúspecial state‚Äù in which I feel like I can run forever and my mind becomes incredibly tough and I am able to run much greater distances without going mentally insane from the discomfort. Yes, my legs are MUCH stronger than my arms, but I have not slacked off on training my arms, especially my forearms at all.

To be clear, my title is quite inaccurate, as though it is true I have been doing calisthenics for over a year, I have not been training solely my arms. Though being completely honest, unless my form is just incredibly bad (which it should not be), I am unable to do more than 20-25 push-ups (Close grip).  
\*\*This little paragraph probably does not make sense to many as to where it is placed, as this was the original first paragraph I wrote, but I decided to add more context to my post and wrote the paragraph right under the bracketed words/above this one before posting\*\*

When I began training, my record was only 8 push-ups, and my body was shaking like crazy near the end, which showed that my core was weak as heck. But after a few months of doing various calisthenic exercises, like push-ups, bodyweight squats, sit-ups, etc, my record was about 30, now after continuing to train myself for almost a year after that, my record has gone down to 20-25, even though my body is insanely stronger than before. I can do several pistol squats now, my forearms are muscular as fudge (compared to before), and pretty much all of my prior muscular feats from a year earlier have been beaten by a lot.

I personally believe that this has only happened because I keep changing the kind of push-ups I do, as I used to do regular push-ups with a wider grip, but I eventually began to experiment with progressions so I would not have to do as many repetitions as before. I tried close grip, spider man or super man (whatever they were called) push-ups, diamond push-ups, and a couple others, but it seems that whenever I tried doing a different push-up, even just a slightly different push-up from the regular ones, like close grip, the reps I could do decreased immensely for that specific push-up, which you could say is normal, but after trying those different push-ups for a while I decided to try doing regular push-ups again to see how much ‚Äústronger‚Äù I became, and guess what, my reps decreased instead of increasing for a regular push-up, and by quite a bit, it was like my strength nearly reset, my record went from like 30 down to 10 or 15 somehow. I am assuming that I guess different push-ups target ever so slightly different muscles, even down to the individual muscle fibres, which maybe is why my reps decreased even though I got ‚Äústronger‚Äù after trying different push-ups, but it still feels wrong and not normal to me at all.

Another interesting thing to me is that even though I am so much stronger than I used to be, the amount of weight I can lift (doing bicep curls) has not increased at all for almost two years (even when I was a fat and weak kid), which would support my prior statement that certain exercises target certain muscles, even down to the exact fibre, meaning that even though I have improved my calisthenic capabilities, my ability to lift weight (aside from my own body weight I guess‚Ä¶) has not improved, like at all‚Ä¶

Has anyone experienced a situation similar to mine, or is there an obvious explanation, or did I already have the answer to my problem?",2025-05-13 00:29:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1kl8lui/why_am_i_unable_to_do_more_than_2025_pushups/
1kixmc1,bodyweightfitness,Starter exercise recommendations for someone with depression,"Hello!

I'm a high school senior and I'm about to graduate soon, and I plan (hope) to start getting exercise on the summer.

For some context about me is that I for one have depression (haven't got officially diagnosed yet since I haven't been to the doctor, I will soon) for the past few years and it kinda really affected my lifestyle. I've never done any exercises at all, unless you account the forced exercise is gym for class but I didn't really try. I had no motivation for any sort of activity, and I spend most of my time literally just laying in bed. 

When it comes to diet, it's very poor. I generally just go off junk food and microwavable meals. I don't often eat proper meals and definitely don't eat 3 times a day nor at set times. I'm very skinny and apparently underweight, however it's mainly genetic since I've always been this way. 

I'm aware this isn't healthy at all. Honestly, surprised I haven't really been impacted physically? I never feel ill or anything due to it, or maybe I don't realize it. However I'm aware it'll impact me soon enough, won't be young forever. So I want to try some starter exercises, at least something to get me to build strength and muscle as although I'm skinny, I realize I'm severely weak and it's embarrassing to barely be able to lift 15 lbs. 

So does anyone have any recommendations? I don't really have any body goals in mind per se (maybe one build in mind but I'm not worried about that now). Just want to start getting fit! Maybe that'll also help with my depression a bit. 

Also want to say I do have some exercise equipment at home from my mother! Would like to stray from the idea of going to a public gym for now (mainly because I'm unsure where a local one is, lack of transportation, and social anxiety lol). 

Thanks :)",2025-05-10 00:29:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1kixmc1/starter_exercise_recommendations_for_someone_with/
1gr7xj0,bodyweightfitness,How to build a workout routine,"Hey everyone!!

I‚Äôm new here and looking for some advice‚ÄîI‚Äôm planning to organize a home workout routine!

Here‚Äôs what I have so far: dumbbells (0.5kg to 2kg), a waistwhisper with drawstring, a stepper, a mini pedal bike, a hip thrust belt for attaching dumbbells, ankle resistance bands with cuffs for glute work, and two resistance bands (one easier to stretch, the other thicker).

I bought this equipment to start working out at home to lose weight. I‚Äôm not very overweight, but I did gain about 10 kg due to stress and depression. I‚Äôm hoping to lose that extra weight and build muscle, especially around my tummy and glutes.

I follow a Mediterranean diet, so food isn‚Äôt an issue‚ÄîI rarely eat junk food or snacks. I‚Äôm not new to working out, but I‚Äôve mostly relied on walking (usually an hour a day, including some small hills) and haven‚Äôt used dumbbells or equipment before.

Any helpful advice would be much appreciated!",2024-11-14 15:55:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gr7xj0/how_to_build_a_workout_routine/
19blzww,bodyweightfitness,"No progress in forever, help please","Good day to everybody, i‚Äôve been on and off working out with some breaks up to several months because of too much school since october 2020, but of pure working out it could be around 2 years total, last break was a month or two last september and october. I haven‚Äôt seen any progress for about 3 months now. Anyway here are the stats for context:

17 years old, about 183cm/6‚Äô0 and 76kg/168lb, currently slow bulking to 78kg. Most likely about 18%bf (wild guess). Can do probably 5 bar muscle ups or a few one arm pushups.

Goal is to eat about 3000 calories daily and keep high protein, no junk food. Getting usually a bit over 5, max like 6 hours of sleep on school days, around 9-10 on weekends. Hope i didn‚Äôt forget anything, if i did, tell me in the comment please!

My routine looks something like this, i have a rotation of 5 different days, workout ideally 6 times a week if i‚Äôm not sick, absolutely swamped with school or something, one day a week i go to the gym with a friend and do similar muscles on machines and free weights. I also own a dumbbel with adjustable weight, rings and a belt for weighted calisthenics. I do rep dropsets, such as 13, 10, 8, 6 instead of 4x10 but i‚Äôll write it as such in the plan for less complexity. When i start a new progression i usually start at 4x6 reps or 4x12 seconds and work up to 4x12 reps or 4x24s before moving on to the next. I‚Äôll also put the exercises at the level i am currently at. I try to go to or near on basically everything. In the past this routine worked just fine, i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the cause behind this terrible plateau.

Day 1, rest 60-90s between sets, around 3 mins between exercises, some are supersets if they do different muscles:

Straddle back lever negatives 2x7s 

Very advanced tuck back lever holds 3x8s

Ring dips 4x9 (literally the same reps as almost 2 months back)

Ring flys 4x10

Lateral raises 10-12.5kg 4x10

Pike pushups 4x6

Pseudo pushups 4x6

One arm skull crushers 10kg 4x10

Sphinx pushups, as many as possible in 120 seconds

Finger pushups 4x7


Day 2, rest 60-90s between sets, around 3 mins between exercises, some are supersets if they do different muscles, except on weighted pullups, there i do 120-150s rest:

Oap and muscle up skill work

Weighted pullups 22.5kg 5x5 (used to be 30kg in summer, can‚Äôt seem to get it back)

One leg Dragon flag lifts 4x6 (used to be full in summer too)

Bicep or Hammer curls 12.5kg 4x10

Small rom nordic curls 5x6

Wrist curls 12.5kg 3x15

Reverse wrist curls 5kg 3x15

One leg wall tib raises one foot far from wall 3x20

Weighted One leg calf raises 20kg


Day 3, rest 60-90s between sets, around 3 mins between exercises, some are supersets if they do different muscles:

Straddle back lever negatives 2x7s 

Very advanced tuck back lever holds 3x8s

Ring dips 4x9

Lateral raises 10-12.5kg 4x10

Pike pushups 4x6

Pistol squats 5x5 each leg

Most sphinx pushups in 120s or skull crushers

Finger pushups 4x6

One leg tib raises 3x20

One leg calf raises 20kg 3x20

Day 4, rest 60-90s between sets, around 3 mins between exercises, some are supersets if they do different muscles, except on weighted pullups, there i do 120-150s rest:

Oap and muscle up skill work

Weighted pullups 22.5kg 5x5

Full Dragon flag holds 4x12s

Bicep curls 12.5kg 3x10

Hammer curls 12.5kg 3x10

Day 5, rest 60-90s between sets, around 3 mins between exercises, some are supersets if they do different muscles:

Pistol squats 5x5 each leg

Small rom nordic curls 5x6

Kneeling quad extensions 5x6

jump lunges 10kg 3x15 each leg

One leg tib raises 3x20

One leg calf raises 20kg

17ild9i,bodyweightfitness,Am I too Old for gains? Muscle and Strength?,"

I'm 47, 5'10 tall, I weight 180 pounds and have a 20% fat percentage.

I have been working out like 5-6 days a week for 1.5 years. I spend 70 mins on strength training 5 days a week and 20 mins cardio 6 days a week. 

For the amount of effort I put into my workouts I feel like my strength gains & physical appearance don‚Äôt match my efforts. I feel like I should be more muscular. 

My diet averages 1700-2000 calories per day. Tracked on fitnesspal. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol at all.  I don‚Äôt each junk food or pop. 

My trainer thinks I should add Creatine and Protein to my diet. I‚Äôm on the fence as I really don‚Äôt know what the right thing to do is. My ultimate goal is to get stronger. Currently can do pull-ups 6-5-5-4-4-3 with 1:30 between sets. 

Anyone have advice? Am I too old for this? Or maybe set lower targets?

EDIT: the amount of support and advice is amazing. Thank you everyone. I have some edits to come which clarify my workouts and eating habits and history. I‚Äôm new to the fitness world unless you include my under 20‚Äôs habits. ",2023-10-28 19:41:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/17ild9i/am_i_too_old_for_gains_muscle_and_strength/
1648c7v,bodyweightfitness,Am I obsessed with fitness to an unhealthy degree?,"So my wife recently has been complaining to me that I‚Äôm obsessed with fitness and that it‚Äôs affecting our marriage. She said it‚Äôs all I think about and that my entire life revolves around health and fitness. Below I‚Äôll outline my routine and I want some honest opinions from you guys, as I feel that I‚Äôm not obsessed at all but I also don‚Äôt want my wife to be unhappy.

I work double shifts three days a week, so I only train 4 days a week. Monday-Thursday I do a full body calisthenics workout that includes a ten minute warm up, about 35 minutes of calisthenics and then 30 minutes of zone 2 cardio. I usually wake up and eat a pre-workout snack, workout, then shower and eat a post workout meal. The whole process takes about two hours total including training, showering, and eating. 

My diet is pretty clean. I eat a Mediterranean style diet and avoid processed foods 90% of the time but do usually eat some junk food as a treat once or twice a week. My wife thinks I‚Äôm too strict with my diet but I personally enjoy it and it keeps me feeling good. I don‚Äôt feel great when I start eating lots of junk food or take out so I do try to stick to healthy eating. She said my eating interferes with normal life because I don‚Äôt eat out at fast food places and like to cook my own food. 

At bed time I usually take 20 minutes to wind down with some breathing exercises and stretches because it really helps me manage stress and l get a good night of sleep. She feels it‚Äôs excessive and interferes with us relaxing together and talking before bed. 

The truth is I‚Äôm very passionate about living a healthy lifestyle and doing so has really made me feel great and has improved my quality of life in so many ways. But I‚Äôm feeling a bit confused because from my standpoint I feel that I have a pretty reasonable lifestyle and I don‚Äôt think working out for 1 hour or so 4 days per week is obsessive and I also feel that eating clean is something that can be challenging sometimes but is a worthwhile goal. 

Not really sure how to handle this as I can‚Äôt see myself ever giving up my fitness habit but I also don‚Äôt want to hurt my marriage. She tells me that all I think about is fitness and my health and that I have no other interests in life. I definitely am very passionate about it but it just seems a bit overboard to say I‚Äôm obsessed.",2023-08-29 04:26:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1648c7v/am_i_obsessed_with_fitness_to_an_unhealthy_degree/
1618tw9,bodyweightfitness,Over 2 months of working out but I feel weaker,"I used been able to do 30-40 pushups and 5-6 full dips without a problem, before I even started working out. Now that I'm doing bodyweight/calisthenics for over 2 months, I can barely do 1 full dip, and barely 10 normal pushups. I still can't even do 1 normal pullup. Every bodyweight exercise I'm doing I have to do it assisted as I can't even do more then 3-5 reps. I even lost 3kg from 78 to 75kg. I see some muscle gain but overall its not as noticeable. Why are my arms still so weak, what am I doing wrong? Is it maybe just fatigue? Should I take a weeks long rest? I workout 4-5 days a week with 2-3 days off between.  


This is my workout plan  
Monday = push and pull day

\- 3 sets of assisted dips for 10 reps

\- 3 supersets of pushups + assisted pullups 10 reps

\- 3 supersets of pike pushups + inverted rows 10 reps

\- 3 supersets of bicep curls and tricep extensions 10 reps

Tuesday = legs/core/abs day

\- 3 sets of bulgarian squats 10 reps

\- 3 sets of pistol squats 10 reps

\- 3x1:30min plank or 3x30 sec superman hold

\- 3 sets of leg raises 10 reps

\- 3 sets of normal crunches 10 reps

Wednesday rest

Thrusday  + Friday same as Monday and Tuesday

Saturday + Sunday  Active rest/stretching/cardio

I haven't  eaten junk food for over 2 months,  I eat healthy, drink a lot of water, my body type is ectomorph and I looked skinny fat, but now I managed to  cut away the belly, but muscle mass and overall  mass is still low. My whole life I couldn't get any weight or mass even when I had years of eating unhealthy food with 0 physical  activity. Everything goes into belly, while my arms and legs are skinny.

15hv9vc,bodyweightfitness,Advices to become better,"Hi everyone. First of all apologies for my bad english and long incoming message. I've always worked out in the gym, but occasionally, and this prevented me from achieving good results. 

This year I have been more constant than ever, in fact since January I continue to go to the gym 3 times a week constantly. Thanks to my structure and my genetics, I have achieved a satisfactory result in terms of muscle mass - my dream is to have an aesthetic and athletic physique, therefore quite defined. Now I'm at a standstill and I don't know how to progress. I think it's that more difficult phase, where you see results but you can't perfect the shape. 

I know it would be advisable to contact a professional, but maybe someone can give me some advice based on the details that I will list here and the photos that you will see. I'm a law student, so very sedentary if I don't count the 3 intense workouts. The other days I don't get to 1000 steps a day. 

- I am 180cm tall and currently weigh 84.5kg. I've always had a buildup of fat in my belly and that's my problem. In the gym I mostly do one-hour bodyweight workouts, since I'd like to approach Calisthenics, while I use weights only to train my arms - which in my opinion are the genetically disadvantaged point of my body. 

- Currently, my Galaxy Watch 4 Classic scores a muscle mass of 36.8 kg and a fat mass of 17.3 kg with a body fat percentage of 20.5%. I added some cardio but it seems to be getting worse. 

- Now comes the important detail in my opinion: during the week I've been mostly in deficit (about 2000 kcal or less per day with these macros: 235g carbs, 150g proteins, 51g fat) for months, while at the weekend I'm not careful with my diet and I eat what I want, probably reaching at least 3000 kcal. 

-I don't abuse alcohol or junk food. I have no thyroid related issues. 

Unfortunately i can't attach photos. Thank you for your time if you have chosen to read my experience and possibly to advise me on a path to follow.",2023-08-04 09:30:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/15hv9vc/advices_to_become_better/

My workout split is: Upper-Lower-Upper-Rest-Lower-Upper-Lower

For my back and biceps i do 3 sets of chin ups to failure (usually 5-6) and 3 sets of pull ups to failure (usually 2-3), i know my pull up is weak so i do the tips online like do 3 sets of 8 scapula raises every day and eccentric holds

For my shoulders, triceps and chest i do 3 sets of 8 dips, 3 sets of 12 diamond pushups, 3 sets of 8 clapping push ups and 3 sets of 12 regular push ups

One thing i do see progress on is my legs so I'm not gonna mention them here

I can't conrol what i eat, I only eat what my family makes.

I rarely skip any days and when i do i amost alway try to make up for it by doing more in the next day.

Sometimes i get lazy and skip 1 set of the workout every few weeks.

Please help me as i am completely lost and don't know what to do, I tried googling it and didn't find anything that helped. I've been super discouraged to workout for the past few weeks

Edit: Thank you all for being so supportive and helpful for me, and a lot of you asked me for a more specific description of my sleep pattern and diet, here it is:

I usually get around 6-8 hours of sleep every night (mostly 7)

I can not get anything else to eat that is healthy and protein dense whatsover because of my school schedule and how strict my family is ( I can't order online )

I can not see what the ingredients of my foods are because I'm not around in the kitchen when they are cooking, usually I'm busy with school, homework or just chores around the house.

 But usually, it consists of a bowl of rice, a meat dish (idk what to call them, i'm not that good at english) (usually chicken or pork or something like that), a vegetable dish, and soup. 

They sometimes bring snack home but it's just junk foods like potato chips and stuff like that so i rarely eat them

Also here's my heght and weight: 165cm and 56kg ( my family has really short genes )

Note: i have seen improvement in my performance, here's some of them:
-Chin ups: used to be able to do 2 now 5-6

-Pull ups: used to can't do any now 2-3

-Push ups: used to be able to do 18-20 now 24-25

-Dips: used to be able to do 5 now 7-8

BUT i have seen almost no changes in my appearance at all


Edit 2: i can not get a part time job, i only get the stuff that i want through grades that i do in school, I'll try to convince them to let me order online one day but maybe not now because of my personal and family reasons which I'm not confortable of adressing them here. There's isn't any restaurant nearby and there is a market but not a standard market in Europe or America that most people in the comment section assume, idk how to describe it but it's like a chinese town on very low budget or you can just google images of southeast asian markets",2022-09-01 10:44:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/x34cj7/ive_been_working_out_for_a_little_over_6_months/

My mom is 56 years old, she is overweight but not obese, also she is a bit knock kneed and spends 8 hours sitting at work and the remaining time doing crochet and watching TV sitting down at home.  She had a minor knee injury almost a month ago and it should definitely have been gone by now, but of course, all that sitting down is starting to show on her health. Every time she gets up she complains about not only her knees but her hips are becoming a problem too. She also as terribly low self esteem, and doesn't take care of herself at all, and I'd like that to change.

I exercise regularly at home and go for runs, and now I'm thinking that if i exercise with her, it will help her lose weight and make her knees better. At the same time I'm afraid that the exercise will make it worse, so that's why I'm asking for advice here!

What are some good exercises she could do that will help her gain some muscle, especially on her legs and get some weight off as well? What type of cardio would be best in this situation? (She can't ride a bike btw and at home she only has a treadmill üòÖ)



Edit: thank you everyone for your comments! I want to add that she does have a healthy diet, only home cooked meals with veggies and chicken, no red meat or junk food. HOWEVER she has a big apetite and eats much more than her body needs. She also has low thyroid function and gained some weight from that plus the medication too (corticosteroids).

Doctor said it would be almost impossible to be as slim as she used to be because of that so she kinda gave up on herself.

Btw she's 5'7 and 200lbs

Edit 2: guys i know diet -> weight loss and mobility-> exercise, i just want some exercise ideas that she can do so she isn't stuck to a wheelchair in 10 years. She can lose weight if she really wants to but she sits down way too much, i worded it wrong :)

Edit 3: wow guys wait she actually 176lbs now i was wrong üò¨ thank you guys so much for your ideas! I wrote up a plan and am discussing it with her, we are going for a walk today (stopping if her knee starts hurting which should take about 20 minutes as things are now, not bad) and discuss what she would like to do while we're at it!

srxchd,bodyweightfitness,"Starting my journey, after advice!","Hi all.
So a bit of back story, I used to go to the gym daily around 7-8 years ago, primarily lifting heavy ( also was a rugby player for around 15 years ), made some huge progress, got toned up, abs and was generally happy with how I looked. Then I got kidney stones & completely lost all drive.
Since then I‚Äôve had kids, become lazy, eaten junk food excessively and overall just stopped caring.
I‚Äôm 5ft 8. 2 weeks ago I decided to get myself together and look after my body. Mainly due to aches, pains & generally being unfit.
I started at 13st 4lbs, it will be 2 weeks on Wednesday and I‚Äôm currently at 12st 8.
I have been doing exercises daily such as, squats, pull ups, push up variations, dips, ab work outs, variety of body weight exercises, dumbbell & resistance band exercises, trying to alternate muscle groups daily.
I‚Äôm a endo/mesmo body type, I can gain and lose weight so easily, it‚Äôs a blessing and a curse lol.
My goal is to get back in shape, I want my abs and definition back, along with feeling healthy.
I‚Äôm currently cutting quite hard but eating around 1.4g  of protein per KG of body weight, should I just keep on as I am? I thought cutting would be my best bet first as my body fat % was so high and my BMI being quite far into the overweight range.

sfgmce,bodyweightfitness,Is this fitness goal achieveable with the recommended routine?,"Hey there!

I'm a 20 years old 172cm tall guy, I believe I weigh about 56kg right now.

After years of practically no physical activity I've decided to start exercising this week. My plan is to start with the BWF Primer and then go on to the Recommended Routine. On two of my off days I'm thinking of doing some jogging/running.

My diet right now is fairly healthy, no junk food or sweets, a lot of vegetables and meat. But I eat very little, I don't have much of an appetite and it's probably due to the fact I have a very sedentary life.

Right now, my main goal is to look like this:

https://imgur.com/a/zt72EZW

I know how childish it might seem to want to look like a video game character, but I kinda really like how Link looks in BotW, and I want to have a body like that. Strong, but not bulky. Still fairly slim.

And I also want to have well toned legs and glutes, from the research I've done it seems doing squats and running will help with that already.

Some of the transformation pictures I've seen in this sub make me think I could get to my goal within half a year, but I'm definitely not certain.

I'm very new to all of this fitness stuff and I feel like there's a lot more research I should do but, right now I just want to know if my goal of having a body like that is achieveable. If it is, I'm gonna do all it takes to get there!",2022-01-29 11:52:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/sfgmce/is_this_fitness_goal_achieveable_with_the/
rkbdlg,bodyweightfitness,my progress after one week of body weight exercises (14 yro)(253 lbs)(5'10),"I came up with the idea of testing my body to see if I could start exercising again. I started doing 100 jumping jacks, 30 knee push-ups (too heavy right now), and 30 second plank whilst playing basketball, I started Tuesday and just got finished with my little workout. But during the past few days I've noticed a big change in my body. I didn't lose weight but my form is starting to come back. For the last few months I've grown taller and stayed the same weight from 2020 but up until a few months I looked out of shape. Thanks to playing football I gained a somewhat muscular form and the exercises have made me feel better. My calves have started to get harder and you're able to see the muscle outline of them, My arms are getting a little more toned and I'm able to jump higher. I've always been able to do planks but now I feel as if my stomach has gotten tighter. And I look good in hoodies now. I'm starting to believe I have fast metabolism because it's only been a few weeks or it's just a placebo affect but either way I'm loving it. But dew to my weight my back has been starting to hurt after I landed wrong after a layup. it hasn't been the full week but I think it'll be even better once I start to do this full time, I've also noticed a boost in confidence when out in public. After this I'm thinking of getting into strength training but I don't think my parents will listen, I've tried losing weight in the past but they keep supplying me with junk food and the urge is hard to resist. I'm also thinking of getting into boxing for endurance since I'll be trying out for the basketball team next semester.",2021-12-20 01:36:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/rkbdlg/my_progress_after_one_week_of_body_weight/
qrrdql,bodyweightfitness,Going to begin my journey to get fit once again!! Need tips...,"Hello everyone.... Just before covid hit, I was at my ideal weight of 175 pounds. I'm a 6 foot dude and all throughout my life I've never been that slim. I looked good enough to be very confident and it felt great. However due to the lockdowns I've put on 50 pounds... I'm at 225 now but because of my height I don't look that out of shape. 

When I lost my weight initially, it wasn't because of gym or exercise at all. I was just very active and played a lot of sport... Now since I was stuck at home for around almost 2 years and have an office job 8am - 5pm, i've hit the depressing weight of 225...

Is there anyone out there that can recommend a weight loss regime?... Preferably on YouTube but any will do...

I don't eat junk food, don't drink sodas, don't eat snacks, etc...

Any help would be immensely appreciated.

q4sz6y,bodyweightfitness,What food should I eat to gain more muscle?,"
Hey! I'm a 16 (5'4/98lbs) yr old still living at my parent's house which means I can't really control my diet that much. I decided to start bodyweightlifting recently but I'm not seeing any change or feel like I'm becoming stronger. I think what is messing me up the most is my diet. I eat a lot of junk food but I'm really skinny. Skinny to the point you can see my ribs. 


What are some foods or snacks I can eat to consume more calories? Also, what's a good way to track my calories? I'm going to the grocery store to look for food. Would appreciate any recommendations!

Another thing, I've been doing the RR mixed with some dumbell workouts. I've been skipping the Warm ups. Are they necessary?",2021-10-09 20:08:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/q4sz6y/what_food_should_i_eat_to_gain_more_muscle/
os6d2e,bodyweightfitness,3 Month Progress - 189.8 to 164.0,"Not really sure if progress photos are allowed or not but I wanted to share with anyone that may need some motivation! 

\-----

At one point, I was a very high level athlete and had never been above 15% body fat. Over the last few years I have been steadily gaining weight due to no longer competing and starting my own business. Time seemed to slip away but I kept gaining weight. 

Then COVID hit last march! I was forced to stay at home and put my business on hold. At this point, I started to develop severe depression. I was over eating and drinking alcohol almost every night. I went from weighing 160lbs to 189.8lbs at 5'6""!

My wife and friends eventually pushed me to go speak with someone and I finally went to the doctor in April to seek help. 

It was May 1st that I decided that I was going to transform my body as well as my mind. I stopped drinking alcohol, energy drinks, and eating fast food.

I started off by doing 1 min of planks every time I felt the need to eat any junk food. After about a week of just doing planks, I started walking 1 lap around my neighborhood. 

Eventually that turned into doing pushups, squats and pullups with my planks. Before I knew it, I was doing anywhere from 400-800 pushups/squats and 50 pullups per day! Yesterday I ran 2 miles for the first time in over 5 years without stopping!

&#x200B;

After 3 months of doing nothing but small at home workouts; I have lost 26lbs. Here is my progressive photo.

If you are struggling with depression please go speak with a doctor! It has helped me get my life back on track and living healthy again. Sorry for the long post!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR: 

I was depressed and gained 30 lbs over the last year. My family pushed me to see the doctor for help. After seeing the doctor, I decided to get back in shape. I lost 26lbs from cutting out alcohol, junk food and doing pushups, squats, pullups and planks.

nmizdw,bodyweightfitness,Do core exercises worsen love handles?," Hello everybody, I‚Äôd like to start with calisthenics but firstly I feel like I should try to get rid of my love handles. It has been insecurity all my teens because I was fat when I was a kid. I‚Äôve seen many videos that talk about how to lose fat but as I‚Äôm skinny they recommend not to start a caloric deficit and neither I want to lose weight I just want to get rid of my love handles. 

I saw a video of ATHLEAN X a long time ago and he was telling not to do core exercises or similar things, or your love handles could worsen because you‚Äôre starting to build muscle in those areas. The best would be to start avoiding junk food and doing exercise so the overall appearance of your body increases. 

Should I do core exercises to lose my love handles?

nklwcw,bodyweightfitness,"I‚Äôm 16 and only doing abs and cardio workouts (bodyweight only) to get abs and a flat stomach, is that okay?","Hi everyone, I just started exercising around two weeks ago because I got healthier over quarantine which means I got a more prominent belly now (I was underweight before and did not look healthy). I‚Äôm 16 years old, 5‚Äô6 in height, and 63.5 kilos. I have a fairly skinny body but I do have some belly fat. I believe it‚Äôs in my family‚Äôs genes to have some stomach fat since my dad‚Äôs side has more plus-size bodies while my mom‚Äôs side has more slim/average bodies.

I‚Äôm pretty happy with my body now but I‚Äôm kinda insecure about my stomach so I started to do a 30 minute ab burnout workout and a 30 minute fat-burning cardio workout both by Sydney Cummings. I do the ab exercise on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays while I do the cardio one on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Saturdays and Sundays are my rest days. I‚Äôm also tracking the food I eat using an app, trying to eat only 1500 calories a day. I eat one fruit after my workout and also eat some (not a lot) fruits and veggies throughout the day. Will doing only these workouts be enough? Should I do more? Will this work? I don‚Äôt really want my body to look buff, maybe just get a more toned frame. I seriously cannot find an exact answer to this through research so I decided to come on here to ask.

(Note: I‚Äôm also trying to get a smaller waist and have my thighs get smaller as well, so maybe anyone could give a recommendation to do about them)

Hope someone will help me with my problem! All answers are appreciated :)

nfmll8,bodyweightfitness,bit of a dillemma on how to approach working out,"I'm a sophomore in HS and due to the ever lasting stress of school i have put on quit a few pounds of weight in fat. I'm 5 foot 9 and 179 pounds and i have a standard sized frame that a person would expect in a 15 year old. I've been looking into getting back into working out but i have a few issues i want to iron out that i think are my main problems when it comes to weight gain. 

1. Eating junk food (Nutella, chocolate, peanut butter, other shit): Its not like i chug down on this stuff its in moderate quantities but the problem for me is that i eat it almost sporadically and i can go one day without eating any junk food without even trying to eating it like 3 times in one day because i suddenly am bored and its the best thing at my disposal. Im a person who likes to nibble A LOT and these unhealthy foods have been messing me up. what are some good alternatives to eat that will both satisfy my needs for nibbling and not have me intake 1000 calories daily in processed garbage
2. i hate any type of cardio that dosnt have a purpose behind it. I find running the most obcenely stupid thing ever and i cant wrap my head around why people like it. Ive been told by people that i run ""wrong"" and that i dont have the midnset. On the other hands i love sports and before quarantine i was a top-athlete at my school in soccer and basketball but being isolated has just put me in a room with a ball and no one to play with. I need some creative cardio that isnt mundane like running so i can enjoy my cardio again
3. I have no idea how to create a regimin and stick to it. my workouts are all over the place and if i feel like doing a specific muscle group that day i do it. Never organized, i dont know how do that and it completely demotivates me and i have no idea how to personalize a schedule for me. The same goes for food. Ive tried dieting before but logging calories for me is the most imprecise thing ever given that none of the meals i eat are standard american food (european) so i get lost after about 2 days. at this point the only diet i think i can stick to is not eating junk food because it dosnt require precise planning. How do i get all this nonsense in order.

So I‚Äôm 14 years old and I‚Äôve been trying to get a six pack for the last 3-4 months. I‚Äôve been in a caloric deficit but I do still workout at home with only bodyweight and dumbbells cause that‚Äôs all I have. I do cardio and lots of football drills but that‚Äôs not the point. I started at 5ft 6, 140 pounds and 16% body fat. I‚Äôm now 5ft 7, 122 pounds and 10.3% body fat and I maybe eat something junk food like once a month and that will be like 2-3 of my brothers takis or like a handful of his Cheetos or a piece of a Kit Kat. When my parents eat fast food once or twice a week I will cook my own chicken and when they order out ice cream I don‚Äôt get any. I only eat natural sugar and very little processed sugar but almost none. But I still don‚Äôt have a six pack even with 10.3% body fat. So I want to know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I‚Äôve done hours or research and the only things I can find is that my genetics are very bad. So that‚Äôs what I was thinking and maybe it‚Äôs impossible for me to get a six pack.

kv1hro,bodyweightfitness,What do you think about my progression (21m). Started going in october 6x2h week,"\[Disclaimer!\] I TAKE VYVANSE FOR ADHD, my psyciatrist said it may give me more energy but not more strength..  
Hello there, I don't want to be cocky or sound has one really, I just want an honest opinion if I am putting too much strain on my body.. People in the gym are saying I use steroids in a joky way, but I know they mean it...  


So, background, I always practiced sports kinda intensely, since forever...  
Started playing football and riding a bike at 5(?) Used to ride my bike every day, from 10 years old always played football in school during breaks (2-3hrs) until I was 15..  
Used to mountain bike at least 10km (6 miles) in the woods every day after school, from 12 to 15 yrs old...  
From 16 I moved and started doing push-ups until failed every day, Stopped for months then back at it again..  
At 18 started doing some basic calisthenics for 30 mins a day, the consistency wasn't great, also with month breaks...  
Was always very very skinny, my abs are visible since I remember looking into a mirror as a kid...

Stopped exercising much at 20 years old with only biking on Sunday, the road only but with my Mtb with high friction tires, about 60km (37 miles), was intense but nothing much...   
Around March My country was in lockdown so I started playing football every day with one other friend, mainly free kicks for around 1.5h a day... A bit intense, my feet hurt badly, and my I had open wounds in them, but I never stopped even with the pain...  
Stopped Exercising completely around June...  


Started going to the gym 6 times a week for about 2hrs like I said in the title, the only free day is Sunday.. I do 5 mins of cardio not intensively before workout only.  


So this is my routine,  
(Monday - Back and Tricep 

Tuesday - Chest, and Bicep) Some times Monday and Tuesday is inverted

Wednesday  - Legs and Shoulders

Thursday - Back and Tricep

Friday -  Chest and Bicep  
Saturday - Whatever I feel like but never chest or bicep... (I try to do legs, but sometimes I don't have the energy)  


On top of this but without any schedule, I also train abs, forearm and lower back and I never train this 2 times in a row..  


I never train more than 4 muscle groups (2 from the day to day list and then I add 1 or 2 from the unscheduled list..  


I started doing Supersesets 8x4x(4 larger muscle groups 3 smaller muscle groups) ex. 8x4x4 legs and 8x4x3 triceps

Then in the middle of November I started doing overload sets 5x4 or 5x3 in smaller groups  


Last week of December I started Pyramid 15, 12, 10, 8 increasing weight (trying to)

I believe Overload is not working for me...  


So from this stats, my PT says this is insane gains, I also see that this is very big gains and I want to know if this is because I am new or genetics or athletic background?  


Any recommendations of what I may be doing wrong?  


Also, Food:  
I do not take care with what I eat.. Tho I do not have junk food at home,

kjxpy3,bodyweightfitness,Bodyweight and weightlifting helped me (and is still helping me) to get through the worst times in my life,"This is my first post, and I am not able to share pictures, so I will have to wait for that. But I wanted to share my story, in case someone is having a hard time like me, and tell you how I went from 87kg/192lb to 67kg/148lb, in 6 months, gaining A LOT of strength in the way.

Six months ago, back in June, I realized that my relationship with my (now ex-)girlfriend, whom I was living with for two years, was falling apart. A lot of things going on in our lives, and the fucking covid didn't make things easier. This was the ignition point of my transformation. At the time, I was probably in the worst shape of my life (85kg/187lb, given that I am 170 cm/5ft 7in tall, I was stepping into obesity). I am 32, and I had done sports before, but I was starting to be way too sedentary, and the lockdown didn't help. So I decided that something in my life had to change: if it helped to recover the relationship, it would be great; if the relationship was to end, I didn't want to look into the mirror to see a fat, sad guy with no girlfriend and no goals in life. So I started looking for exercises and stuff to do at home.

I found calisthenics through Chris Heria and Jeff Cavalier, and I started to follow some of their routines, mainly cardio and abs, and then I added some chest, lower body, and strange setups for back with towels and stuff, since, atm, I didn't have a place to hang from. Within a a few days, I found enough material to start working out at home 6 days/week. In the beginning I struggled to finish 3 (out of 5) series of the cardio workouts that Heria was proposing, dying every cardio session, I was not able to do more than 3 proper push-ups, the abs workouts were a living nightmare... Until I started to get better at those things. And, without realizing it, I had lost around 15 pounds in a bit more than a month. I noticed it while looking in the mirror, and also, clothes that I was not able to use were fitting...I was in the right direction! Of course, I also stopped with all the junk food that was populating my diet then, and started eating healthier. And all of this also helped me to keep my mind busy and not overthinking about the status of my relationship.

Finally, in the beginning of August, my ex- and I broke up. I was going to start a new job in other country, and she couldn't handle the situation, so we decided that the best course of action was to end things. It was a fucking shitty moment. But as I said, working out helped me (and is still helping) to get through this.

So I moved away, and started my new job. And in the way, I learnt about the Recommended Routine. This magical thing came into my life like fallen from heaven. Perfectly organized, super simple setups, almost endless progressions (at least for me, who was a total noob)...and a lot of people confirming that it worked! So I got myself the pullup bar, the ab wheel, and a rubber band. And then I dove into it. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I was with the RR, and Tuesday and Thursday I threw in some cardio in the form of jumping rope sessions.

Needless to say, I was not able to do a single negative pullup. It looked so simple, and yet it was SO FUCKING HARD...!!! But I went with the progressions that I could handle. And I progressed through the routine. I kept working out, and by the beginning of September I was able to do dips, negative pullups...and DIAMOND PUSHUPS! I was amazed of how far I had got, starting from almost scratch (I remember trying the diamond pushup back in June, and I thought it would be forever impossible...).

And then I moved in to a new house where working out was going to be a bit hard. And I had a gym nearby, so I decided to give it a try. I showed the gym PT the routine I was following, and he liked it, but he recommended some modifications given all the options available in the gym. He looked like the guy who knows the stuff, so I followed his advise, and started hitting the gym 5 days/week, doing gym adaptations of the RR three days, keeping the cardio in between.

And, from mid-September to now, I kept progressing, day after day. Now I am able to do weighted pullups (15kg), pushups (17.5kg) and , dips (20kg). I also started to count macros, I lost a lot of fat, I gained muscle... My back, arms and legs are growing bigger, my butt is becoming hard rock, and I can finally see my abs. Moreover: I am starting to see EIGHT abs. I feel amazing, and I don't see a limit for me right now.

Besides all of this, my health has improved a lot. I used to snore while sleeping, and had apneas, and I don't have it anymore. I used to sleep a lot, not getting proper rest, and now I sleep quite well... And to all of this, I have to add the psychological benefits over my break-up. I have to admit that I am still having a hard time trying to get over it, but seeing how far I have got is helping me in a way I couldn't have expected, and my new body gets me a confidence that I did not have before.

To finish my story: thanks to all the people that contributed to create the RR, because it became a turning point in my workout routines. I would not be the way I am today if it weren't for you guys.

If you reached this point, thanks for taking the time to read me. And if you are, like me, having a hard time in your life, I hope this text helps you to overcome the difficulties and gives you the motivation you need to become stronger than ever in your life.

is8vct,bodyweightfitness,Finally managed to do 7 pull-ups,"2-3 years ago, me and friends went to a nearby park and there was a pull-up bar. I remember I managed to do 7 pull-ups, which I know is not very impressive, but it the the second highest among my friends. So yeah we are not the healthiest group of friends. We decided to exercise regularly but juggling college and work meant no time for exercise. 

Now 2-3 years later, after all the late nighters and junk food, I became even more unhealthy. I went back to the pull-ups bar and couldn‚Äôt even pull my self up for the second time. A week a go I bought a pull-up bar that attaches to the door and started doing pull-ups everyday. Each day I increased the reps. Finally today I managed to do 7 again. I know its not much but I am very proud of myself. I will be continuing my journey and hopefully I can do more. 

Can anyone let me know ways to improve my pull-up quantity and what number to aim for? Thanks.

Edit: Reading the replies I realized that doing 7 is really good. I didn‚Äôt wanna sound like a dickhead. I live in Nepal and here most people say ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt do 10, its shameful‚Äù that made me think that my achievement wasn‚Äôt that great.",2020-09-13 23:05:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/is8vct/finally_managed_to_do_7_pullups/
h0gdn0,bodyweightfitness,Fatigue post workout,"I‚Äôve been following the RR for a little while now (month or so). I haven‚Äôt been religious in my consistency (due to being overwhelmed with work), but I‚Äôve managed to keep to the schedule most weeks. 

My issue is that I get incredibly tired after my workout. I don‚Äôt really feel like doing anything other than laying in bed. I don‚Äôt count calories or anything. I normally workout before lunch time and I find it hard to continue with my work because I‚Äôm very tired. 

I‚Äôve stopped eating junk food (getting food delivered etc), and been cooking my meals. I think I eat just under 1800 calories a day (I use a meal delivery service which has a rough estimate of the calories for each of the recipes they provide). And making sure to take some extra potion in the form of shakes to top up so I can reach a reasonable level: I weigh 73kg and I try to take about 100-120g a day. I don‚Äôt really eat breakfast though. 

I used to rock climbing quite a bit and after stopping for about a year followed with an unhealthy diet I ended up gaining about 10Kg. 

I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm so tired because by body isn‚Äôt used to working out or if there‚Äôs something my body is trying to tell me in terms of nutrition. Maybe I should try to eat more?",2020-06-10 18:05:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/h0gdn0/fatigue_post_workout/
g6k4tx,bodyweightfitness,How To Train During Ramadan,"Hey guys! One year ago I wrote an article on how to train during Ramadan. Since Ramadan is close, I figured I'd share the full article here:

**Ramadan Mubarak! It's the time of the year where over a billion people start their month of daily fasting. In some countries this fast takes over 20 hours! Did we mention that you're also not supposed to drink water during that time? Yeah, it's pretty tough! This leads to a problem some of our Muslim friends face: HOW SHOULD I WORKOUT?!**

## Veteran

Don‚Äôt worry, in this article I‚Äôll do my best to guide you through this Ramadan so that you can maintain or even enhance your training gains. As a Ramadan veteran who has successfully done multiple cutting and multiple bulking cycles, I do my best to teach you the ways!

## 1. Hydration

Starting off strong with hydration. Your primary goal during this month should be to stay hydrated. This is your most important goal, whether you are planning on working out or not. How do we do that? It‚Äôs rather simple:

1. By getting in plenty of water.
2. By preventing excessive water loss.

Let‚Äôs start by discussing the first point. What does plenty of water entail? To find out, [**use a water intake calculator like this one**](https://goodcalculators.com/water-intake-calculator/). The first thing you might notice is that you need quite a lot of water. For example, I weigh around 64 kg and need 3-4 liters of water per day.

I achieve getting that much water by making sure I drink about a liter each hour. Pro tip: It‚Äôs easier to drink water when having a meal. When you‚Äôre not eating, consider drinking something that is packed with electrolytes like coconut water. It‚Äôll be much easier to get a good amount of water in that way. If you‚Äôre hardcore, get yourself an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and drink that. Be advised, it‚Äôs not the most delicious thing out there.

The second point is of equal importance. It‚Äôs extremely important to prevent excessive water loss. If there is a way to do something you want to do without sweating, do that! This probably means it‚Äôs a good idea to shorten or eliminate your cardio sessions. Your training environment is also of importance. You don‚Äôt want to be working out in the sun or in a gym without air-conditioning. Stay in the shades and find a climate controlled gym to prevent excessive sweating. Oh yeah, not sure if I should even mention this, but‚Ä¶ like don‚Äôt go.. to the sauna okay?

## 2. Eat enough

Eating enough can mean different things depending on your goal. However, the general rule is: you should be eating an equivalent amount of food during Ramadan as when you‚Äôre not doing Ramadan. Nothing changes, you just have a shorter amount of time to get the food in.

**How to eat a lot**

If you‚Äôre planning on making mass gains during Ramadan, you‚Äôll have to learn how to eat a lot in a short eating window. These are some tips to help you to achieve that.

1. Eat small meals frequently. A lot of people make the mistake of having a huge meal after they break their fast and stay full for the entirety of the eating window. They get 1000-1500 kcal in and stop eating for the rest of the eating window. This isn‚Äôt really effective if you‚Äôre trying to gain weight. Instead your meals should all be small and you should be eating every 45-60 minutes. Unfortunately not everyone has the privilege of staying awake throughout the entirety of the eating window. If that‚Äôs you, strongly consider not gaining mass but rather maintaining mass or follow the other tips.
2. Your last meal should be your biggest meal. In the previous tip we talked about having small meals frequently so that you‚Äôre able to get in more calories. However, your last meal can be a huge one, because you‚Äôre not going to have your next meal for a while. Just make sure to not vomit. It has happened to me and it‚Äôs quite possibly the worst thing that can happen during a mass cycle.
3. Eat foods that have a high calorie-volume ratio. Some foods are extremely low in calories even if you get kilograms in of them. Vegetables are good example of that. Try eating food that packed with calories like nuts. Junk food is also fine, just don‚Äôt overdo it and make sure you don‚Äôt miss out on your micro-nutrients and get too much sodium in.

**How to eat less**

Eating less is actually much easier for most of us during such a short eating window. Just do the opposite of what you should be doing to eat a lot.

1. Eat one or two meals only. Just calculate how much you need calorie wise and get that in having only one or two meals.
2. Eat foods that have a low calorie-volume ratio.
3. Drink protein shakes to feel full.

**Protein**

Make sure to not skip your protein shakes if you were taking them. Also strongly consider having around 25-50 grams of casein protein before sleeping. Casein is a slow-digesting protein that slowly releases amino acids. This means that you‚Äôll have protein supply hours after you stopped eating!

## 3. Training goals

It‚Äôs easier to make more strength gains than mass gains when you have a short eating window, especially for bigger athletes. We strongly recommend you do to be doing a strength or skill cycle for this reason. Strength workouts are also shorter than hypertrophy workouts and require less hydration and nutrition.

This doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt do a mass cycle during Ramadan, it just requires more work. You‚Äôll need to drink and eat more to able to benefit from it. If you think you‚Äôre capable of putting in the work without vomiting, then by all means go ahead. However, remember: the bigger you are, the harder it will be to do this. Be realistic and think carefully before deciding.

## 4. Workout timing

A question that I often get asked is: When should I do my workout? There is no clear answer to this. Research on intermittent fasting seems to suggest that timing doesn‚Äôt really matter. However, Ramadan is a bit different from a typical intermittent fasting diet. The windows are usually longer and hydration is a non-issue when doing intermittent fasting.

I personally prefer to have my workouts as close as possible before breaking the fast. I don‚Äôt feel like having to deal with being extra hungry and dehydrated for the entirety of the day. Instead, I‚Äôd like to workout and immediately break my fast and start eating and drinking.

Some people can‚Äôt do this. They feel too tired (which could be a sign of not eating and/or drinking enough) to have a workout when they‚Äôre deep in their fast. An option for them is to work out during the eating window. Have a small meal and do your workout an hour later. Some research seems to hint at a better power output when doing this compared to the first method. Nevertheless, there is a huge con with the second option: you‚Äôre sacrificing valuable time that could be spent on eating on working out. This might not matter if your goal is to lose mass. But if your goal is to maintain or gain mass, then it might not be the best idea.

## 5. Eat nutritious

Last but not least, eat nutritious. Our eating habits change completely during Ramadan. It‚Äôs very easy to have a small variation of food where you miss out on a lot of essential things like fiber and vitamins. The best way to prevent that is to eat as closely as possible as you usually would eat when not fasting. Supplements can definitely also help if you want to maintain a more flexible diet. The point of this paragraph is just to make you aware of that you‚Äôre making drastic changes in your diet and to be aware of that.

Hopefully this article was of use for you. I wish all of you good luck with your training and self-improvement during this month. Remember to enjoy it. Don‚Äôt forget why you‚Äôre doing it in the first place!

fviuhc,bodyweightfitness,Confined in a small space shared with my family and loosing my motivation to stay fit,"Stuck at my parents house for a month now because of the lockdown. I used to go to a gym for more than a year now, but now i can't and have to resort to doing home workout. Its been pretty hard to do some of these workout since we have such little space. And what's worse was everytime i do workout i feel being severly judged. 

Well, i don't have my own room here, so if i had to do push-up, plank or crunches i had to do it in the only space available, in front of the couch while the rest of my family are sitting comfortably awkwardly trying not to look at me doing my *thing* as they continue to watch netflix. It doesn't help non of my family members ever workout and they never understood why i need to sweat away calories. I feel like they hate me for making them feel bad about themselves.

Another problem is that, i had to wake up my relatives just to be able to use that *floor*. We have very little space that we use extra cushion to sleep on the floor. 3 people sleeps on the floor including me and i had to wait for them to wake up to just use it or force then to get up. And they sleep a lot. Sloth-like. They sleep more than 16 hrs a day. Waking them up just to exercise was terribly awkward. Although they never said anything against it, i feel like i have been judged for being so *pretentious*.

Another problem, i lost track of my diet. You can't be choosy when you're living off canned goods for  a month now. I never missed fresh vegetables so much in my life. My dad is in-charge of cooking and he's able to keep things interesting and we may have had the most variations you can get out of canned tuna. I used to make it a habit to add fresh fruit slices to my every meal, now we only have canned peaches and pineapples and they taste horrible.

My family loves their snack, so before the lockdown they made sure to stock up on their favorite bags of chips, popcorn and sodas that we have enough supplies to last two more months with these. It's a struggle to watch them gobble up these junk food while lazily watching netflix without participating myself.

I gained more than 5lbs in the last month staying here and i'm starting to hate myself. I lost motivation to stay fit, and had stopped working out the last few days. Its a lot more convenient just to just watch tv all day, sleep all night, and eat whatever we have in-between. This living condition is becoming unbearable but i don't have anywhere to go. It feels like prison.

How do i gain back motivation to stay fit in such condition?",2020-04-05 18:43:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/fviuhc/confined_in_a_small_space_shared_with_my_family/
f9736q,bodyweightfitness,Any success losing weight with a no diet approach?,"So, it has taken me a long time (years..) of thinking and working and struggling to sit down and get this out. I hope I am able to explain thoroughly and clearly enough the situation. What I am looking for is really any advice, but also comments or thoughts from anyone who might be in a similar situation. So not just answers, but also feedback and conversation :)

I have struggled with weight for as long as I can remember, I think it is fair to say I have been either on a diet, or thinking about a diet, since the age of ten. What is sad is that this is far from abnormal, the more you start to listen to people, it starts to feel like everyone is on a diet of some sort. It feelsss like, 1 out of 10 girls that I talk to, will admit to having suffered from anorexia, however, statistically the disease affects 1-5% of the population. I know feelings are not a reliable source of information, and the above information leaves room for many biases and misinterpretations. The point I am trying to make is that eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating.. any form of disordered eating and thought patterns) seems to affect many more people than statistically reported.

So that is why I am searching for a way to live without obsessing over what I eat and look like... But, like everything in life... much easier said than done! ;) I am aware that the title of my post may give the impression that I expect to eat Doritos all day magically lose weight. This isn't really the case, but my experience with traditional diet and weight-loss is that either 1. I can not manage to stick to an eating/exercising regimen, and everyday I wake up feeling like, shit.. gotta start again.. ( I have gone months and years like this) or 2. something magically goes off in my head, my willpower is insane, I lose a good amount of weight, but then all the willpower dries up, I'm left mad obsessed with calories, food, and anything related and I binge eat all the weight back.. which brings me back to scenario 1... I am just tired to putting my life on hold until I lose weight.. I feel like this consumes so much of me, I don't want to waste my life worried about what I weight.

About me personally, I am a 21 year old girl, not overweight, not really chubby, but not 'slim'. I was a normal/cute kid, but I definitely had an appetite. I grew up in a small down and was not super active with sports. I developed a habit early on of turning to food for a lot of things, anxiety, boredom.. whatever else. I started to pack on the pounds at around age 10, puberty. Furthermore, my family is quite preoccupied with looks and weight, so there was always the pressure to be thin or lose weight. There was a lot of guilt which surrounded eating.. always eating too much, or too unhealthy.. By age 17 I was 5'5, no muscle to speak of, and weighted around 155/160 pounds. Largely because of the no muscle, I was not cute and looked like I carried around a cloak of baby fat.. the acne didn't help either. Anyways, I went to Au Pair for a summer and my Au Pair mom asked me to go on a diet with her. I said yes, and continued dieting when I returned to for my senior year of high school.

It was the first diet which really worked for me. Throughout my early teens a spent a lot of time putting together fad diets which failed after a few days a left me confused with what was wrong with me. This time, something just clicked and food became nothing but numbers, I was obsessed with counting calories and restricting. I started in August at the above measurement 155 pounds and 5'5, but by the following March I weighed about 110 and completely and totally raving crazy about food. I hate to call it anorexia because it almost feels like a title of honour the way some girls have it. Plus I never really got to the point where I was a stick girl in the hospital, but I think I would have gotten to that point if I hadn't gotten the help which I did. I remember my life revolved around that obsession. I would have panic attacks if I over ate or did not exercise. I followed a strict regimen around eating and exercising everyday. I was cold all the time, I was doing poorly in school, my hair was falling out, my period stoped, I could not focus on anything, I was day dreaming about food, looking for excuses to cook, and I was completely and totally miserable.

Anyways, the summer after my senior year I was privileged to earn a scholarship and spent the entire summer abroad, studying language with 14 other amazing American students. Needless to say, there was A LOT of food, good food, cultural food.. whatever. and I BINDGED!! I couldn't control anything, I was eating like a maniac, and the guilt that consumed me was crushing. But I couldn't control it. By the end of the summer I was back at the same weight and size I started at and beyond upset with myself. In September I started at University along with the cycle of broken dieting...

I actually managed in the new year ;) resolutions baby! to ""get my shit on track"" but this time not as strong as the first ""successful diet"". I think in January I was 150 pounds and by March like 125 pounds. And I looked good! But I was still obsessed with looking fat and losing weight. Anyways, again came summer after my freshman year, I went back home, and regained all the weight..

Now it has been a year and a half, I am in my Junior year of college, and weight 140 pounds. During that entire time, I was obsessed with getting back on a diet, getting my 'shit on track' I have carried around a journal and logged everything I ate and almost everyday has ended in 'failure'.

At the beginning of this month I got a grand fucking idea (please don't remind me that I am a fucking moron, trust me, I know already). I had heard of the success of an Adderall diet.. I thought it would be better to just skip the pill and go straight to the source.. speed/amphetamine.. So I got some speed, took a tiney winey bit.. the next few hours were fantastic, I didn't eat a thing (success? ;)).. But then had the WORST FUCKING COMEDOWN OF MY LIFE WHICH LASTED FOR 1 FULL WEEK. I swore that shit off for life.

In the past two weeks I have finally started to wonder if a no-diet approach would work. I am just so sick and tired of the cycle. And wasting my life on it. I would like to achieve a weight of 125/130 pounds, I think it is realistic for my height and shape. But I want to maintain it and diets do not seem to work for me. Basically, I want to be healthy, I know how to eat healthy, I know how to cook and what vegetables are, I like to eat healthy. I love physical activity, yoga, gymnastics, dancing.. but I hate the gym ;).. Of now I do not eat sweatners or fizzy drinks, chips.. other junk food. But I like croissants, and chocolate, and I like to go to brunch with friends, and I just want to live my life without going crazy around food. Has anyone had success with this? Also - disclaimer -- I am more than aware that weight does not ""just fall off"", fitness is not easy, otherwise everyone would look amazing. I am just wondering if anyone has had more luck with a carefree approach.

Any thought, advice, comments would really be appreciated. I would also be interested to hear any similar stories should you have the energy to explain.

Thank you so much to those who took the time to read and reflect. I really like the community on reddit and am excited to hear what you guys have to say.

Around 130lbs in the first picture. Sitting in between 155lbs and 157lbs these days. [1.5 year transformation ](https://imgur.com/gallery/YT42MbE) 

(Edit): Followed the RR for the first year working out 3 times a week. Went from RR 3 times a week to doing push/pull/legs 6 days a week to focus on hypertrophy through weighted movements using a 20lb vest and volume. Currently training 2-3 times a week training mostly handstand, planche progression, and iron cross with some of the basic compound movements . I learned handstand, straddle front lever, 4 sec supinated back lever, 6 sec adv tuck planche,  2 sec straddle planche with alright form occasionally and a few other things. Training has been on rings pretty much exclusively and only other equipment I have besides the rings are aforementioned vest and some resistance bands for warm up and slight conditioning.

(Edit): I ate the same meals every day for the most part because it‚Äôs easier for me that way, but I wouldn‚Äôt say no to a friend wanting pizza or something like that. The meals were either slow cooked barbecue chicken thighs, brown rice and cast iron seared broccoli or homemade burgers, mashed potatoes and cast iron seared broccoli. Never really been a big junk food or dessert eater, other than my soft spot for chips, so cheat meals weren‚Äôt really an issue or concern.  I‚Äôm not quite sure how many calories I stopped counting because it would just stress me out and make me think I wasn‚Äôt getting enough food. I just learned to listen to my body, when it comes to meal size and frequency.

Been a great journey and it‚Äôs been fun mastering my body. Current goals are straddle planche on rings and floor, straddle press to handstand, full front lever, one arm handstand, as well as Iron Cross and eventually Maltese.

cq0knw,bodyweightfitness,"24/M/5'11"" 1 Year, 4 Months Progress from Calisthenics/Gymnastics","Hi everyone! I posted a year and a bit ago on r/Fitness detailing the first year of my transformation.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/85qzw4/22m511\_1\_year\_journey\_from\_162\_lbs\_to\_151\_lbs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/85qzw4/22m511_1_year_journey_from_162_lbs_to_151_lbs/)

A few days after posting that I discovered calisthenics and body-weight exercises and it completely changed my life. I used to lift weights 5-6 days a week and also did Judo/Muay Thai at the same time, but since moving home for the summer I switched into gymnastics in order to help me progress in my calisthenics and general flexibility, and man is it tough! I obviously still have a very long way to go before I can even say that I'm mediocre at many of the skills, but I am very happy with the progress I have made so far, and it's been inspiring seeing so many posts here and on r/Fitness showing people's progress. I work out a lot because it's sort of become my passion and my main hobby, and it honestly changed my whole life so I'm just hoping to help someone else out who's just starting or inspire someone like others did for me at the beginning.

I'm happy to answer any questions or take any criticisms you might have about how bad my squat and deadlift are (I didn't start training back/legs until late in the game...)!

One of the main things I noticed after over a year of body-weight training is that my body-weight dropped significantly. If you‚Äôll notice from the April 2018 picture, before starting calisthenics, my body fat % was still way over 10%. I‚Äôm not sure how low it is now, but if I had to guess I would say it‚Äôs around 8% (feel free to correct me if you think otherwise!).

**Sunday ‚Äì Core & Gymnastics**

¬∑ Same as Tuesday/Thursday.

&#x200B;

Right now I have gymnastics on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays for about 3.5 hours a night, meaning I can only train weights three days a week. Until September I've changed my shoulder day to be a part of my chest/triceps day.

My workouts changed significantly, as I shifted from just doing weights every day to doing mostly weighted calisthenics. I saw a lot of videos online of people doing these crazy moves on the bar with their body and decided I wanted to try it out.

My diet also changed significantly as I started to cut out all of the fast food, junk food, sugar, and unnecessary carbohydrates. I stopped drinking for the most part, which has also helped a lot, because not only am I never ""too hungover to workout"", I don't have those empty calories holding me back. Since giving up alcohol and fast food/junk food, I‚Äôve noticed dramatic increases in my workout progress and my wallet hates me less.

**Here is what my diet mainly consists of:**

*Protein -* Chicken, eggs, fish, steak, duck, Greek yogurt

*Carbs -* Quinoa, fruit (berries, avocado, dates, figs mostly), vegetables (broccoli, asparagus, sweet potato, green beans, SPINACH)

I cut out most dairy products and white foods like pasta/bread/potato stuff because I found it just made me bloated and sluggish. I don‚Äôt drink coffee or tea, only water because I prefer it. I get a lot of questions to why I don‚Äôt have any peanut butter or nuts in my diet ‚Äì I‚Äôm allergic. :(

abi0h6,bodyweightfitness,A note about new years resolutions,"As I type this, it's just gone midday and I woke up all of 2 minutes ago. I'm already halfway through a slice of last night's pizza and nearly downed a can of fizzy drink while contemplating my new years resolutions:


*Be healthier. Be more active.*


Sounds like the first thing I did on 1st January was break both of them straight away, right? Wrong. For two reasons. Number one is that I'm starting my resolutions midway through January anyway to give me a chance to finish up all the festive goodies hanging around (I was gifted a LOT of chocolate and I'm not letting it go to waste! Except the bounty bars... they can get lost). But number two is the one I'm hoping might help: 


*If your resolution is to QUIT something, you've already failed. Instead, try to START something*


If you try to quit eating junk food and then slip up and have a burger, you've failed your task. But if you've started eating healthier and, 3 days in, have a burger, that was 3 days of good health! Next time, aim for 4. When you're starting something, falling back isn't as bad as stopping something because it's almost impossible to fail. If you're quitting smoking and you have one then that frames the situation as a failure, but if you start to smoke less and you have one then that number is still probably less than yesterday's. Well done! Keep going!


The same goes for working out - telling yourself you're going to stop missing workouts or stop eating badly is guaranteeing the feeling of failure when you inevitably have to miss a workout or crave that burger too much. Life gets in the way, that's cool. It happens to all of us, but you've started this journey which means you can carry on with it after your pit stop. Next workout, go about your training as if you've been doing it for years. Or go and half-arse it because you're not feeling it. Whatever, commit to getting back on your promise to yourself and it'll make each subsequent step easier.


I'm not saying don't give yourself goals. If you have something you want to achieve this year then absolutely set that and keep looking forward to it. I'm also not dispelling the virtues of discipline and trying to regiment your workouts and stick to plans. I'm just saying that it's something you've chosen to start, so even if you can't do it for a day that doesn't mean you haven't started anymore.

This idea is already common knowledge for a lot of people and that's fine. But if it'll help a single person on this board then my job is accomplished! This board has given me so much over the past year, and I hope I can give just a little something back to anyone who's starting out where I was this time last year. Remember: a random stranger on the internet who you will most likely never meet is proud of you for being here! Good luck!



Tl;dr - frame your new years resolution as something to START rather than something to stop, and you're way more likely to succeed",2019-01-01 12:58:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/abi0h6/a_note_about_new_years_resolutions/
9gomcg,bodyweightfitness,[PROGRESS REPORT] Second year of structured training,"**TL:DR** September 15 was the second anniversary of me starting a complete training routine (2 years ago before that I did around 3 months of shitty half chin ups and push ups to create the habit of working out). In this post I'll link a summary video of what I've achieved this year, some progress pictures and detailed considerations about my training. Also I'm curious if I can be diagnosed with fuckarounditis or if my progress is alright considering my stats (the ""progress"" section below, everything else is a bonus if you want a long and detailed read).

**PROGRESS**

A year ago I made a progress post too, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/70knpj/progress_report_one_year_of_recommended_routine_1/), but you don't need to read it, I'll write down the relevant stats in this post.

**My goals for this year were to get stronger, mostly with fundamental movements (horizontal pull and push, vertical pull and push, legs anterior and posterior chain), and specific goals I worked on the most were handstand pushups and the one arm pull up. I did not focus much on size, I know it's important for strength long term but I'm not good at bulking.**

Current stats: **182cm 80kg (5'11 176lbs), age 25, 17cm(6.7'') wrist size, 23cm(9'') ankle size (to give an idea of my frame size**. My fasted weight went from 78kg/172lbs to 79.7kg/176lbs. During the day my recent weight was between 80-83kg (176-183lbs). 

**[Progress pics are here](https://imgur.com/a/R6ka1wT).** I don't see much visual difference but looks like I gained some muscle in some places without losing leanness. 

**[Progress video is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTPTo17uAmk).** In the description there is a table of contents with timestamps for all the movement patterns, or read the ""current level"" section below if you don't feel like watching the video.

**Starting level** - by September 15 2017 I was able to do these things: 

* Upper body: 1 slow bar muscle up with a false grip or 7 kipping muscle ups with bent arms, 11 unweighted pull ups or 1 with 21.6kg/47lbs, 6 chest to wall headstand pushups, frog stand to handstand, handstand to headstand, 9 ring dips, 3 straddle one arm push ups with my left and 8 with my right, 10 seconds tuck planche, 3 advanced tuck front lever rows with poor ROM, 6 L shaped/piked reps with medium ROM.
* Lower body: 16 pistol squats or 1 with 21.6kg/47lbs, 1 Nordic curl with minimal hip bend or 6 with more hip bend, 5 seconds advanced L sit, 20 seconds L sit. 
* Skill and mobility: 20 seconds handstand (around 30% kick up rate) and 20+ seconds elbow lever. I could touch my toes with straight legs, German hang and skin the cat with pronated grip, rounded back squat bottom hold, stick dislocates.

**Current level:** 

* Upper body: 4 slow bar muscle ups, can also do a few on rings or on a very thick bar, 14 unweighted pull ups, 2 with 34kg/75lbs, 4 chin ups with 34kg (I never trained the underhand grip but got this result when I tried them), 6 with 20kg/44lbs, 9 with 13kg/29lbs, one arm pull up negative with any grip, underhand 20 seconds top hold, 4 seconds middle hold, can break the one arm dead hang and slightly bend the arm, 10 chest to wall headstand pushups with better form, 1 full depth chest to wall handstand pushup, 4 freestanding floor handstand pushups, 4 dips with 40kg/88lbs (I don't train them, this was a test result), feet together one arm pushup with either arm, slightly untucked planche for 10-15 seconds, 10 seconds on rings, rings tuck planche pushup, half lay front lever raise to horizontal, shitty one leg front lever holds, improved the ROM of the rows and when tucked it's almost full, can do 7-9 piked reps depending on form, 5 decent one arm inverted rows.
* Lower body: 26 pistol squats, 3 clean reps with 30kg/66lbs, 1 shaky rounded back rep with 41.6kg/91lbs, 8 barbell back squats to parallel with 100kg/220lbs (the only time I ever tried them, form wasn't great so next time I'll try with plates under the heels to go full depth), 10 Nordic curls with minimal hip bend, 20 reps with moderate hip bend, 4-8 one leg Nordic hinges depending on form, partial one leg Nordic curl negative, 9 Matrix squats with the back touching the floor, 1 rep with the maximum ROM possible (haven't seen anyone else making a video of that), partial one leg Matrix squat, partial one leg sissy squat, 5 seconds shitty V sit, 25+ seconds L sit (don't train it anymore), 
* Skill and mobility: 30+ seconds handstand (improved kick up consistency, 40-90% kick up rate depending on the day), 5 seconds straddle one arm elbow lever. At some point I was at [this level](https://i.imgur.com/1Qw02Vx.png) with the pike stretch, now can touch fists down with straight legs (lack of practice), supinated German hang and tuck back lever (improved bicep conditioning), ankle mobility did not improve at all (because of impingement, will try voodoo band flossing and hopefully it helps), hip mobility slightly improved, stick dislocates slightly narrower and shoulder extension improved allowing slightly deeper dips. My wrists got more mobile and robust, since now I can practice handstands and one arm elbow levers with little to no warm up.

**Structure of my recent routines:** 

* Monday, Wednesday, Saturday upper body, Tuesday, Friday lower body, football/soccer with friends some days. 
* For the strength exercises the tempo is mostly explosive concentric, fast eccentric without falling into the joints, no pauses except 1-2 seconds for front lever rows and pseudo-planche pushups, and I lower slowly when doing sissy squats. For loaded mobility I hold 5-20 seconds depending on the exercise.
* Upper: warmup with joint rotations, GMB wrist routine, 5 pull ups and 10 dips, 5 sets of 3 assisted one arm pull ups [like this](https://i.imgur.com/Iqqw4iL.png), 5 sets of 5 wall headstand pushups, 3 sets of 5 piked front lever rows, 3 sets of 7 pseudo-planche pushups with shoulders around one fist in front of the hands, 3 circuits of stick dislocates, active shoulder overhead mobility, seated pike compression hold.
* Lower: warmup with joint rotations, 5 pistol squats per leg, 5 Nordic hinges, 5 sets of 4 one leg Nordic hinges, 5 sets of 5 sissy squats, 3 sets unassisted side split progression stretch, 3 sets unassisted front split progression stretch, 3 sets standing calf stretch followed by squat bottom hold to push the knees out and improve hip mobility.

**TRAINING**

Most of my training was based on the 4 upper body and 2 leg patterns (horizontal pull and push, vertical pull and push, legs anterior and posterior chain), starting with a short warm up of joint rotations and easy exercise variations, then strength work (3-5 sets of each pattern), then mobility and prehab. Before the end of 2017 I was doing 3 full body workouts a week, but then I switched to 3 upper and 2 lower body (less leg sessions because I often played football/soccer with friends, which affected recovery).

Most of the time I was doing vertical push and pull first, then horizontal push and pull when more fatigued, maybe that's one of the reasons my progress with the front lever and planche was not great (and also exercise selection, I was mostly doing bent arm stuff like front lever row variations without much pause at the bottom and not many planche holds). 

For mobility and prehab I often used supinated German hands, starting from the foot supported version and after some months progressing to unsupported, and often reverse wrist curls (helped eliminate forearm splints in muscle ups) and false grip work. In the first half of 2018 my mobility work was more diligent and I was doing Jefferson curls with around 5kg/11lbs, they improved my pike compression significantly, while in the last few months I was more minimal and my mobility somewhat regressed with compression and maybe some other stuff.

Sometimes I replaced some sets of a certain pattern with different exercises (for example ring dips with one arm pushups or planche stuff). Tip: you can get a general idea of what I did as my main work or what I played with by reading the titles and date of my videos, [sorted from oldest to newest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXjlEJ38vWmGHum7tOiH9Lg/videos?sort=da).

Before the end of 2017 I was doing weighted pull ups, standing dumbbell military press, tuck front lever rows and ring dips, weighted Bulgarian split squats, weighted one leg hip thrusts. I ended up in a plateau with weighted pull ups (6-7-7 reps with 11kg/22lbs) and the military press (6-7-7 reps with 26kg/57lbs dumbbells). After the plateau I was using a light-heavy format for the rep range (for example one session unweighted pull ups, next session pull ups with 11kg) , I kept this until around mid 2018 when I went back to linear progression workouts without much periodization.

At the start of 2018 I decided to replace the press with decline pike pushups from [Yaad's handstand pushup routine](https://antranik.org/hspu-tutorial-yaad/) and I added Yaad holds as grease the groove skill work. I also did some negatives and partial pushup attempts from the freestanding headstand as strength work, but mostly decline pike pushups. Despite no more dumbbell pressing, the bodyweight work allowed me to get a rep with 32kg/70lbs dumbbells when I tested it after around a month or more, while before I was not able to push that weight up. I would end up unlocking my first headstand to handstand on March 11 and my first floor handstand pushup starting from the top on April 20. Also I made a [wooden board thingy](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-91UPKI01cs/hqdefault.jpg) for Nordic curls and figured out that with some books under the heel I could do weighted pistol squats with good knee tracking and no back rounding, so those became my exercises for leg day, and sometimes I also did dumbbell one leg hip thrusts or dumbbell deadlift variations as extra work.

**Setback:** around February I got sternum soreness/costochondritis, since at the start of my workouts I was doing rings turned out holds as my skill work and I was too intense with them as I tried to prevent the rings from touching my body. By March it was partially gone thanks to rings turned in dips and ring pushups, but dips with rings partially turned out made it return. So I replaced ring work with planche static work and soon after deep single bar dips (like a partial muscle up transition), which allowed me to train horizontal pushing without discomfort. So overall this wasn't a big setback, just made me change my exercise selection and now my sternum should be adapted since a ring tuck planche pushup felt fine, while back then even floor pseudo-planche pushups were uncomfortable.

By the end of February I figured out a way to do [Matrix squats with just a strap and a pole](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7zy8nt/strong_quads_and_hamstrings_using_minimal/), so I started doing them sometimes instead of weighted pistols, and by the end of March Matteo Spinazzola showed [friction resisted pistol squats](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/87e8vm/new_amazing_leg_exercise_by_matteo_spinazzola/). 

March 31 was the last time I did weighted pistols, since after being well warmed up from friction pistol squats against various surfaces I did my 50% BW rep with each leg, although the form was scary to see since I decided to try without the books under the heel and relying on the heavy dumbbells as counterweights instead and ended up with a lot of back rounding, almost a pistol good morning. At least it was still full ROM without the other foot helping.

Satisfied with the milestone of 50% BW, since then I replaced pistol squats with the friction resisted version or with Matrix squats or other quad dominant exercises.

Also during March I greased the groove with tuck L sit pull ups, [going from 8 to 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/89f7ko/grease_the_groove_experiment_from_8_to_13_tuck/). It may have been helpful since I unlocked the archer pull up and got better at muscle ups, but it did not affect reps of normal pull ups much, as in the end I never got past 14 reps (not that I trained the unweighted variation much but I expected better gains).

Around the end of April I figured out that I was able to hold the top of a one arm chin up for a few seconds and I successfully tried a negative to a dead hang, while with the overhand grip it felt impossible to control any point of the ROM.

At the start of June I found a form I really liked for chest to wall handstand pushups, with the hands sufficiently far from the wall that I could go into a Yaad hold at the bottom of every rep if I wanted. So I adopted this exercise for vertical pushing and I'm still doing it now, while freestanding handstand pushups weren't something I practiced very consistently, that's also why it took me until July 18 to get to 2 freestanding reps. Balance was my limiting factor, but the wall work kept increasing my strength. Also I started training assisted one arm pull ups where I pulled towards one hand while holding the bar with 1-2 fingers of the other hand.

In mid June I went to a free gym session with a friend and tested my squats (8 reps with 100kg/220lbs with kinda shitty form, as already mentioned), standing military press (2 reps with 60kg/132lbs and pushed 70kg/154lbs halfway up, maybe I could have done better if deloaded), and did 4 dips with 40kg/88lbs.

From April to the end of August there isn't much else to mention about upper body, while for legs I sometimes experimented with lunatic stuff like assisted one leg Matrix squats and partial one leg sissy squats, while most of my strength work was with Matrix squats to parallel (back then the version with the back touching the floor was super hard, until mid August when I had a breakthrough where I went from sets of 1-2 to sets of 4-6, and in hindsight increasing the volume so fast proved to be a mistake) and I started training one leg Nordic hip hinges, since I got obsessed with the (very?) long term goal of one leg Nordic curls. 

At the end of August I replaced the finger assisted one arm pull ups with a [shirt/towel version](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/92q3l2/an_interesting_approach_towards_one_arm_pull_ups/) that felt a lot more useful, after watching a cool tutorial by Mathew Zlat. I'm still using this version, and it seems to have helped me get an unassisted one arm negative with the overhand grip, which felt impossible months ago.

**Setback:** as mentioned before, I quickly increased the volume of my extra ROM Matrix squats, so in a few weeks the reps per session went from around 3 (not counting the reps to parallel which are much easier) to 25. In mid August I started feeling discomfort during Matrix squats, I had developed mild patellar tendon/knee tendinitis. At least I could still run like mad and kick the ball hard during football with no discomfort, but I had to find a replacement for the quad exercise. I found that partial sissy squat isometric holds felt fine, and later went to full ROM sissy squats, I think they helped since now 2 Matrix squats with the back touching the floor don't cause discomfort, I did 22 pistol squats per leg and 5 leg extension lever raises on monkey bars on September 15. But it's a bit annoying since I was also curious to test if my weighted pistols improved but it will have to wait, hopefully I've learned a lesson.

So this is all, at the start of September I spent a bigger part of the sessions trying unassisted one arm pull up negatives and free handstand pushups to see if there were cool gains and I completed the footage for my summary video.

**NUTRITION/RECOVERY**

The only supplements I used were creatine monohydrate (5g a day) and sometimes multivitamin. My diet was mostly with unprocessed food and almost no junk food, I ate plenty of nuts and seeds since they are dense with calories and protein, but I also got protein from meat, fish, cheese, eggs. I ate around 1 serving of vegetables and 1-2 servings of fruit a day (less than recommended I guess). I did not count calories, I tried to eat 2-4 big meals a day with more than 40g protein each meal, and sometimes adjusted my food intake to slowly gain weight over time. Admittedly this is not a very efficient strategy for bulking and I don't seem to have gained much muscle.

I slept around 9-10 hours every day. Some periods, especially in summer, I had a very messed up schedule where I slept from 4-5 am to 2-3 pm. My life is still somewhat a mess since I haven't found a place where I feel like I belong, my university studies are continuing, not going too well although at least I have completed 2 thirds of the exams I need to finish. I feel like the only stuff that I do that redeems me as a person are working out and trying to contribute to this subreddit. I've mentioned this for context since maybe it affects my progress somehow, I don't feel a lot of stress but maybe this uncertainty has a way of insidiously affecting the mind.

That's all for food and recovery I guess.

**CONCLUSION**

This is how I spent my training year. I don't know if I'll make more progress posts like this in the future, the important thing is to just keep progressing.

I was hoping to get a full front lever but I can't say I focused much on it since it was mostly secondary work while more fatigued, while recently I set the goal of achieving the one arm pull up and I feel like it's going well for now. Also I got less injuries than in the first years and could almost always train with full strength, although I'm disappointed I got mild tendinitis towards the end and did not get to test the carryover of my unweighted leg gains to weighted pistol squats.

I don't know if my progress is good or not, some people get to a much higher level than this in less than a year, although many of them have the advantages of puberty, not being tall and skipping leg day. But still, if I can improve the factors I can control, like how well structured my routine is and how well I eat and recover, my gains will increase. I recently found some very informative comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8x1f33/time_under_tension_vs_metabolic_stress_for/e233t34/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8xy8o5/can_i_build_muscleget_stronger_from_doing_high/e26z8eu/) and I hope Naterman and Yaad's new site will provide plenty of knowledge.

Thanks for reading my post, I'm impressed if you've gone through all of it, hopefully it was informative.

**Story:**
In 2015 I was drinking and eating to excess regularly. Combined with having never really exercised I was very heavy after leaving university (where I also became a massive stoner). One morning I came downstairs after a really heavy night, when my younger brother (who has been lifting since he was probably 13) saw me in the kitchen gorging on junk food and said ""Brother, if you keep eating and drinking like this, by the time you are 30, you will be obese"". I didn't really believe him at the time, as I thought I wasn't that out of shape. However I decided to get a gym membership because I thought it couldn't hurt. I started by following a really simple full body routine I found online 3 days a week, starting each session with either 5 minute intense rowing or 15 mins stationary bike. At this time I was not really paying attention to my food intake, just trying to eat less (basically living off salad and hummus + pitta). In 6 months I lost about 15Kg.

Around 1 year in I decided to buy a bike and cycle to work (about 7Km a day). During this time, I started using MyFitnessPal, I was still regularly drinking to excess and I was eating way under my TDEE (eating around 1200Kcal a day). This caused me to become very underweight and weak, as you can see in the second pic. I was constantly hungry, but not loosing any more weight. I had lost most appreciable lean mass, but because I was skinny and because I was not seeing any muscle definition, I kept lowering my Kcals and upping my cardio (more cycling, sometimes up to 100Km a week). I felt like shit CONSTANTLY and my numbers in the gym were staying the same or dropping. I didn't weigh myself at this time, but looking at the pic I'd say I was around 65Kg.

Around June 2016 (1 months after the second pic) I came off my bike and broke my collarbone. This prevented me from doing ANY exercise for 4 months, during which time I put some weight back on (all fat though), but was starting to look a little less sickly.

Once I could start working out again (around October 2016), I actually decided, ""hey I'm gonna try do this thing properly"" and so I started cycling again (a lot less though) and began my journey into calisthenics. I never actually went back to the gym, instead buying adjustable dumbbells and a free standing pull up bar/ dip station.

First I fixed my diet by making sure I was getting enough protien. Then I started following the RR. Progress came, and within the first year, I was hitting all the upper numbers and progressions in the RR (praise be to the RR). I also bought rings (best decision EVER!)

My progress started to stall around October 2017, at which time I stated adding more volume and doing a push-pull routine of my own devising. This actually turned out to be a really big mistake, as my volume was way too high for my recovery capacity, so I started to stall again and getting minor injuries. I was also neglecting core and shoulder stuff, in favour of more volume during my workouts, creating muscle imbalances and more injuries (my elbows and shoulders felt like shit ALL THE TIME).

Christmas last year was a big turning point for me. I discovered 3 athletes who became massive inspirations and decided to cut down drastically on drink and weed. Max True, Vadym Olenik and u/MarcusBondi were all massive advocates of training in different rep ranges with varying weights, so I decided to build myself a routine in which I could get my primary lifts up to a good weight in the 5x5 rep range, so in turn I could start training in different rep ranges. in late April, my lifts were up to reasonable weights (Pullups and dips were at +20kg 5x5), so I took a deload and now do the following

**Current Routine:**
As well as cycling to and from work 5 days a week (11Km a day), I stick to a high frequency routine, undulating the intensity and volume daily to suit my needs and recovery capacity. This basically means I train push-pull 6 days a week, but perform no more than 3 movements per day (plus 2 days a week I wake up early to do a core routine)

I love the freedom of this style of routine, as it allows me to perfom many movement variations throughout the week, as long as i log all my routines to make sure i'm progression in adding weight or reps.

The most important thing at this point for me is to work within my recovery capacity. I need to 'listen' closely to my body, and never going full tilt (undulating volume and intensity as dictated by my recovery). I like to work within rep ranges of: 3x3, 4x6, 5x5, 3x8, 4x10 & 4x12. Because I change my routine daily and the rep ranges and type of movement I do dictates what weight I add, It's hard for me to post an example routine, however I'll take a pic of my diary if it is of interest.

**Food:**
My food intake has varied massively throughout the past 4 years. Currently I do not track calories (stopped after I broke my collarbone in 2016) except protein. I use BCAAs in the morning, whey for hitting my protien goals and fish oil. One thing, I can usually feel if i've not had enough carbs, as my cycling suffers. My current daily food is the same 5 days a week, and varies a bit on weekends, but currently looks like this, which I prep ever morning:

8:30: 5g BCAA before cycling to work.

10am: Protien shake (banana, 150ml milk, 2 scoop whey, 1/2 tbsp chia seeds, 1/2 tbsp linseeds, 1/2 scoops oats)

12:30pm: 200g chicken, 200g quinoa, 50g frozen green beans

4pm: 2 hard boiled eggs, 2 sardines (co-workers hate me for this)

5pm: 170g low fat greek yogurt

5:30pm: an apple

6:30pm: 5g BCAA before working out

8pm: 1 scoop protein shake and a dinner equivalent to my lunch (changes daily)  

10pm: big spoonful of pure peanut butter.

**Tips/ things i wish I knew starting out**

Food is more important than routines

Never work to full capacity (absolute failure) if you cannot take the time to recover afterwards

Frequency over volume

Working in different rep ranges for best results

Alcohol and smoking kills gains

The food you eat dictates you aesthetic results (eat garbage, look like garbage!)

Warming up your joints (especially your shoulders, wrists and elbows) is the most essential part of the warmup to avaid injury

DO CARDIO!

8moswp,bodyweightfitness,Well. I fainted after my first workout it years. Advice needed.,"I'm a 6 foot 4 inch 24 year old who hasn't excersised in 4 years. My diet has consisted of junk food. I fluctuate between 235 and 240. At probably 25-30% body fat. I want to change that. 



So I got on the floor and did 20 push-ups. Followed by spelling the alphabet with my legs. Then a 30 second flutterkicks. Then 10 more pushupa

Then twenty 25 pound curls. (I know it's not bodyweight so if this needs to be removed then then let me know where I can post this.)

I then got lightheaded. And sort of tried to lie down on the floor because I knew I was going to faint but more of blacked out halfway there and crashed into the ground sideways.


I rewakened probably 30 seconds later and proceeded to just breath a fuck ton while laying on the ground for 30 minutes while my heart slowed.


I'm so damn ashamed of where I've put my body. I can't belive I put it in this state of weakness. But I want to change it.
So what workouts should I be focusing on? And yes I'm fixing my diet.


Thanks lady's and gents in advance.",2018-05-28 09:23:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8moswp/well_i_fainted_after_my_first_workout_it_years/
85ue4k,bodyweightfitness,How to gain weight/muscle in the leg & bum area?,"So, I‚Äôve been underweight for 2 years this August, I‚Äôm currently 7stone 3 (45.8kg) I‚Äôm 17, so, not the average weight for someone of my age & height, I am 5 ft 5 btw. 

I won‚Äôt lie, I have been eating more fatty, oily junk foods as I thought that may help but it just goes to my stomach. Recently, I have been more focusing on carbs & proteins in my diet. Especially meat, but this is hard for me as I don‚Äôt have a lot of money so can‚Äôt keep buying protein rich meats due to expenses. 

I‚Äôve been thinking of weight training along with a diet that will help build muscle or fat (either one, I really don‚Äôt care at this moment!) I hate being skinny! I have never felt so insecure in my life. I don‚Äôt even feel like a woman, even my mum says I look about 12, I hate it. And the junk food just made my skin terrible, it‚Äôs never been so bad before! 

So my questions are: what weights & diet should I start off with to build muscle (or just gain fat) in thigh, leg & buttocks? What exercises are the best? I know squats with weights can do good, I just don‚Äôt know where to start! Going to the gym isn‚Äôt an option either, again, due to the expense (and my social anxiety & insecurity doesn‚Äôt help lol) how many calories should I be consuming a day, so I do build muscle instead of loosing weight even more? I heard exercise bands can be good to exercise at home & build muscle. Any protein shakes anyone can recommend for weight gain? 

I would just love to be more curvy, or thicker, it honestly just kills my self esteem completely. Even just going for job interviews I feel this is a problem, (it probably isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just my current way of thinking) because I look so much younger due to how skinny I am! I hate it so much! 

Any help or advice/knowledge on this topic would be greatly appreciated! Even if it just helps to gain more fat in those areas, I honestly don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs fat or muscle just as long as it‚Äôs done in a healthy way and I get a bit more meat on me! Please also bare in mind that I have to do this on a budget too, I don‚Äôt mind the costs of weights or bands, but more food. Or if anyone else is going through a similar situation and found I solution (or hasn‚Äôt) I would love to hear your story and how you may of got around your problem. 

Thanks :)

83zwtt,bodyweightfitness,I eat almost 1000 kcal of chocolate/cookies/ice cream everyday,"M22/179cm/71kg

I used to have a pretty strict no junk food diet for a long time but about a month ago I had a very eventful cheat day and since then I can't stop having sugary treats. I eat my usual porridge, eggs, veg+lean meat etc but I eat a lot of junk food on top of it.

I would like to stop for obvious reasons however I don't have any drive or motivation to stop because I don't feel or see any negative effects. My stomach doesn't feel bad like it used to; I don't have trouble sleeping as well(I used to after eating sweets). I don't regret it and mentally beat myself after indulging. I just purely enjoy it. Also, I don't see any difference in my physique and no noticable difference in performance. So I'm finding it a bit difficult to find a tangible reason to make myself stop indulging on my favourite sweets. 

I know this is unhealthy and infeasible so that's why I would like to stop. It's probably negatively affecting me in some way I can't directy notice. 

What is an easy way to convince yourself that you're gaining fat and killing gains and progress? Will I suddenly develop a beer belly? Am I getting fat in areas that I can't notice on the mirror? 

How do you kill your sugar cravings? Before, I just didn't get them so I have no experience actively preventing junk food from myself. 

Any comments or experiences are appreciated. ",2018-03-13 00:11:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/83zwtt/i_eat_almost_1000_kcal_of_chocolatecookiesice/
7swkbj,bodyweightfitness,Theory Thursday ‚Äì The Progressive Approach to Dieting,"I‚Äôm going to put this Theory Thursday in the frame of reference of dieting to lose weight. One can also be on a weight gaining diet, of course, but that‚Äôs an article for another day. I also use the term ‚Äúdiet‚Äù to refer to what a person habitually eats, rather than a temporary change, such as a crash or ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù diet.

When it comes to diets, it seems most of us have the tendency to throw every single strategy, tweak, and trick into creating our diet plan. So what usually happens is that we end up with a heavily restricted diet by a litany of rules, that‚Äôs drastically different to what our previous consumption was. Not only is this a huge challenge to stick to, it also means that you‚Äôve already used up all your ways to progress your diet, so when your weight loss plateaus, what will you do next?

A better way to approach your diet is to do the minimum needed to create a sustainable weight change, then to progressively add in strategies to maintain that weight change as your needs change. For most people, a sustainable amount of weight loss is about **0.25-.5kg per week**. Any more than this will often mean that a higher proportion of muscle mass is lost with the fat, which is usually not anyone‚Äôs aim.

#A Brief Note on How Diets Work

All weight-loss diets, whether a named diet such as ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeto‚Äù or ‚ÄúJuice Detox‚Äù, or a diet plan of your own creation, work by reducing the total amount of calories you consume. They sometimes also encourage exercise and other movement to increase the amount of calories you expend. In the end, the caloric balance is in deficit.

Diets can accomplish this by: 

* Restricting the amount of food you eat, such as counting points, counting calories directly, or simply reducing portion size.
* Restricting the types of food you eat, such as no carbs (keto), no modern food (paleo), no food (juice cleanse), no junk. This is usually biased towards banning foods that are calorically dense and not filling.

Diets that tend to work well focus on the psychological side of dieting and how our physiology interplays with that psychology. Certain foods and strategies are more likely to keep you feeling fuller for longer, and avoid the feeling of hunger as much as possible. Often simple rules that ban certain foods can keep them out of your pantry, meaning you‚Äôre less likely to be tempted by foods that can quickly derail your diet.

#Dietary Strategies

Simply pick 1-3 strategies that work well together and apply them for at least a week. Evaluate the amount of weight loss you‚Äôre accomplishing from this strategy. If you aren‚Äôt at the rate of weight loss you‚Äôre aiming for (again, usually **0.25-0.5kg/week**), try incorporating another strategy.

Once you‚Äôve reached the desired weight loss rate, simply focus on retaining those strategies until the weight loss starts to plateau again, then repeat the process above, incorporating new strategies.

This method accomplishes a few important things; firstly, it means that the diet isn‚Äôt a total shock, you‚Äôre making some small progressive changes, and it will be easier to maintain the changes for the long term if they aren‚Äôt massive and drastic. Secondly, like said above, it gives you room to adapt your diet when progress slows. Lastly, it allows you to build the skills of dieting. These come in handy not only during this weight loss bout, but also in future attempts as well. You will get better at utilising these strategies as you use them, making it easier to make the change you want.

#Mindfulness Strategies

**Logging Your Diet**

Yes, simply logging your food is a way of being mindful of your diet, and you‚Äôll find that often this is enough to create some change in your diet, as we naturally affect our diet in response to it being observed and recorded. Tracking also gives you the information you require in order to make more powerful changes. You can simply use pen and paper and search for calorie information online, or use a handy mobile app like MyFitnessPal or FatSecret. 

I believe this to be the most pivotal strategies of them all, and a lot of people grimace at the idea of being so ‚Äúneurotic‚Äù and ‚Äúdoing so much work‚Äù. However, I liken it to deciding to not track your workouts; it‚Äôs the difference from getting a bit of exercise and training to improve for the long term.

Tracking becomes easier and second-nature the longer you do it, and it not only builds the skill of tracking, but it helps you create a better awareness of what you‚Äôre putting into your body, learning the macros and calories of the types of foods you‚Äôll usually eat, and that might surprise you.

**Slow Down Your Eating**

Eating slower can help creating a feeling of fullness. It allows you to eat less of the current meal or not have to go back to the kitchen immediately because the food hasn‚Äôt had time to make you feel full.

**Avoid Eating While Doing Other Activities**

Make eating food it‚Äôs own activity. Try to avoid eating food as something you do *while* doing other activities. It reduces how mindful you can be about what you‚Äôre eating and decreases the feeling of fullness you get from meals. If you‚Äôre eating something delicious, I‚Äôd also argue you get loss enjoyment out of the item you‚Äôre eating.

Too often we consume food while we‚Äôre distracted by TV, easily leading to over-consumption. Sitting down at the table to eat creates a ritual to help become more mindful while eating. One of my big dietary setbacks was eating in the car while driving, which never really satisfied me.

**Stop Eating When Satisfied**

This is the culmination of all the mindfulness strategies, the ability to listen to your body, and be able to enjoy your food without the feeling of being uncomfortably full. I know this is hard for a lot of people due to their upbringing and a culture of not wasting food, but simply not finishing food you‚Äôve served yourself because you‚Äôve had enough is a very powerful strategy.

Personally, one of my biggest dieting breakthroughs was when I went a bit off the rails with my diet and had purchased some fish and chips, which of course comes with a mountain of hot chips as a minimum. I had eaten my fish and a few chips, when I realised I was quite satisfied. I had had my delicious cheat, I had a satisfying amount of food. If I continued to eat, I would have only felt nauseatingly full, and have gained extra calories (something I was certainly not short of). I realised I was losing nothing of value when I threw away the remainder of my uneaten chips.

#Addition, Subtraction and Substitution Strategies

**Drink Water**

Set an amount of water for yourself to drink each day. Start with a good drink in the morning when you wake up, this will not only affect your feeling of fullness, but also increase your alertness and help you feel less drowsy. It might help you rely less of coffee in the morning.

Drinking throughout the day also has the added benefit of making you feel well and being good for your health. Including good poops!

**Eat Vegetables**

Before you even consider trying to cut out foods, I recommend adding in some food first. Vegetables are generally calorically sparse, and nutrient dense, meaning that they‚Äôre filling and good for you. We all know we should probably eat more veggies, but if you challenge yourself to eat a very decent serve of vegetables each day, and change nothing else, I‚Äôd wager you‚Äôll naturally cut out some more calorically dense foods, simply from feeling fuller.

Try to focus on leafy vegetables and cruciferous vegetables, as trying to get large serves of starchy vegetables like potatoes, or sweet vegetables like carrots and tomatoes isn‚Äôt as calorically sparse. Though they‚Äôre still good for you.

**Reduce or Remove Sweet Drinks**

This is one of the more powerful junk ‚Äúfoods‚Äù to dispose of. Soft drinks are one of the most calorically dense foods, least filling, and come in massive servings that are easy to consume quickly. Since they‚Äôre also not very filling, removing them doesn‚Äôt affect your hunger too greatly.

Replace the drinks with water or sparkling water if possible. Drinking diet soft drinks probably isn‚Äôt the absolute greatest thing for your health, but the potential caloric restriction from having diet soft drinks likely outweighs this negative by a great margin.

#Portioning Strategies

**Measure What You Eat**

Absolutely necessary if you want to track what you eat effectively of course, but weighing alone can help you judge consistent servings of your food. A simple kitchen scale is cheap and easy to use. You don‚Äôt have to weigh absolutely everything for this strategy to work, and sometimes it‚Äôs simply impossible to, but the more information the better.

**Use Smaller Crockery**

Using smaller plates and bowls is a simple way to help you portion out less food onto your plate, and can also make you feel fuller after eating. If you want to eat more than a small plate or bowl can carry, it also means that you need to make the conscious decision to go and get a second serve. This allows an opportunity for you to judge your fullness and satisfaction before deciding whether you want to eat more.

**Restrict Meal Timing**

Restricting yourself to a window of eating can help with managing your hunger levels throughout the day, and a lot of people will find they feel no worse not eating for a significant portion of the day. The time you choose to restrict yourself can be quite personal, and depend on what you‚Äôre eating, how much you‚Äôre eating, the physical demands of your day and even your personality, so no one size fits all. There‚Äôs no magic rules about not eating certain things after certain times, so pick a window that works for you.

For those that decide to delay breakfast, my biggest tip is to have a meal planned for the start of your eating window, to avoid binges from hunger. Also consider moving away from traditional breakfast foods and trying dinner like meals; having some protein and vegetables as your first meal is a good way to feel full and get a serve of vegetables in early.

#Conclusion

These are just some strategies to try out, obviously there are a lot more out there, and there‚Äôs the actually planning of meals and restricting of junk food, meal preparation, etc. The plan is all about working out what works for you, and adapting plans to suit you need.

A final important note about weight loss that I don‚Äôt think is said often enough: **it is okay, even normal, to feel hungry**, you don‚Äôt need to feel full constantly shouldn‚Äôt be the normal state, even when not trying to lose weight.

**Discussion Questions:**

* Do you have any experience with any of the above strategies? Good? Bad? Tips or tweaks?
* Do you have any strategies that you‚Äôre using that you feel others could benefit from?
* Any strategies that you‚Äôve tried that simply sucked?
* Are you an all-out dieter, or a steady-progressive dieter?",2018-01-25 14:54:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7swkbj/theory_thursday_the_progressive_approach_to/

Now I train 10 times harded, having an almost perfect diet of 3000 calorie (during summer I was eating only 2000-2200) which includes nice quality carbs, fruits veggies, eggs, cheese and A LOT OF MEAT... Back then I was 3 kilo heavier but I was like 15% body fat while now I am 10% or so... Seriously I dont know how this can happen... I am a lot stronger, a lot more enduranse, a lot better in elements, leaner and still look smaller... especially my arms... Its like I am getting like these guys on calisthenics championship which are really skinny and can do all the freaking elements... Is there anychance that can happen from high frequency, VERY high intensity training ? Should I train less or less intense ?

6mpbwm,bodyweightfitness,"I'm a beginner, and just need advice","Note: Sorry for the long read I notice i ramble on :)  but any help would be greatly appreciated though. I was going to post this on the beginner questions/RR thread but I figured it would be better as a separate post. 

Before I begin, I am 5'8, ~165 pounds and my BMI is a little over 24%. I don't think I'm overweight, but I am skinny fat (look ok/skinny with a shirt on, but without you can notice fat). Most of it is in the belly and sides of back. 

My goal is to lose that fat and gain muscle via calisthenics, as well as freeing up my body and being good at different types of techniques and building strength. I've been lifting on and off for a year or two and have made some gains, but not that much, but I did get some strength out of it. After switching to calisthenics, i realized how weak i was. Aside from pushups and squats, I struggle with chin/pull ups, dips, l-sits, so I'm working on progressions to help me get those down eventually. 

I've seen people on YouTube (including Chris Heria and Austin Dunham) who  really inspired me to get started. Chris Heria is awesome, I watch his vids and they're really helpful, and the dude is pretty ripped and is a calisthenics champion (in my opinion lol). Austin is more my age, and after doing it for two years, he's built up a lot of mass and looks amazing. His videos are great too. He was actually the one who got me interested in body weight training. 

So after some adequate research, I know it's possible to gain mass while only doing calisthenics. It's all about progressive overload and time under tension. But since I'm starting out and hella weak, should I just do the workouts like they're meant, and later once I'm stronger and see results, start implementing things like time under tension to build muscle? 

Also for burning fat, I started doing HIIT cardio after workouts and am trying hard to eat clean, I don't really count my calories, I just try to eat as healthy as I can and avoid junk foods. 

SO TO SHORTEN IT UP MY QUESTIONS: 

1. I think it's possible to build mass with calisthenics, even though it's harder to do so than with weight training. Is this true?  

2. I've noticed that a lot of people who I have seen do calishtenics for years have small legs (chicken-legs). Are there bodyweight workouts I can do to avoid that in the long-run (for legs)? I plan to mix in a bit of weights in my training eventually, like 70% calisthenics and 30% weight training, but for the first couple of years, I will stick to body weight training. 

I'm a fitness beginner overall, so there's a lot I do not know, so any advice from you guys would be good to have. 

So far I'm enjoying bodyweight training! About four weeks into it.  ",2017-07-11 21:22:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6mpbwm/im_a_beginner_and_just_need_advice/
6kzd2p,bodyweightfitness,"Starting out, nutrition question!","Hi folks! 


As the titles says I started out with the recommended training routine last week, a bit of background first:

So I've got a very good metabolism, a solid base from my youth and an active work (electrician) where I burn  - some- calories everyday. 

As I started to look into exercising it started to be obvious that it wasn't only about doing push-ups or pull-ups but also lots of nutrition involved, and this is where I think I need help. 

Excercises wise I don't have much problems as I have strong fondations and can pretty much do all the recommended training, I won't go into the details as it's not the point of this post. 

Sooooo. 

I've changed my nutrition drastically (0% junk food, no more coke, lots of white/red meat, eggs and veggies, very little carbs portions) but I'm not really sure about what to do right now to be honest. 

My long term ideal goal being gaining muscle first then losing fat, the way it is supposed to be done, but my short term goal is to loose fat fast to get rid of those damn titties. And boom, I don't what to do. 

Will I struggle later to gain muscle if I lose the fat I could work with right now to gain muscle? 

Should I endure those titties one or two more years and get rid of the fat later? 

Am I just overthinking this and can loose fat now then gain muscle later as long as I supply my body with enough proteins while staying fit? 

Will I regain the fat I will eventually lost if I want to gain muscle later (because I'll have to eventually up my calories count) ? 

Sorry for the wall of text and the questions flooding, and thanks in advance for your answers! You can tell me if I'm doing shit without gloves, I can take it, and would prefer to know right now if I'm doing mistakes rather than after two years struggling without any result. 

Ps: Also a big thank you to this sub, you guys gave me the motivation to come back into exercising, some of you are true inspirations!",2017-07-03 11:33:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6kzd2p/starting_out_nutrition_question/

I dont know what to do between those  2. Please dont tell me to do both because I cant. I either do one or another. Mixing up running and calisthenics makes me more stressed about my workout because i get lost on what to do and i just dont like mixing it.

What should I do to get fit? Running or calisthenics?

Also,what diet should I do to lose fat? Currently I am only eating 1 meal a day(lunch) because my doctor doesnt allow me to count calories because of medical reasons but i want to lose fat :/

I am also addicted to sweetrs and junk food and i eat a lot of it almost everyday which is why i gained 3kg in the last 3 months(63 to 66 which i want to lose). I want to lose it

I just want to lose some fat,stop looking so full and fat and just be fit and somewhat skinny but athletic with muscle",2017-06-19 10:26:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6i5jwf/should_i_do_calisthenicsbodyweight_training_or/

I'm 27, 1,80 cm, 64 Kg, 14% body fat.
I've always been skinny, even when I was younger and ate a lot of junk food and played video games the whole day.
I started working out 3 days a week for about 3 years and followed a precise diet to build mass also cheating a lot.
I was 63 Kg and gained up to 70 Kg. Then I had an issue with my stomach (reflux) and i dropped the diet, going back to my original weight. 
Now I'm fine, I tried again the same diet, but I'm stuck to 64 Kg with a body fat of 14%
I think it has something to do with the diet, even if I feel like I'm eating a lot, still without results.

When I follow the diet I get :
2672,44 calories
236,68   carbs
67,58     fats
134,42   proteins

I work in front of a monitor for 8 hours a day so I'm only burning calories when I'm training, how is that possible that i can't gain mass? Not even fat.
I follow the diet for 5/6 days a week and 1/2 day i cheat. 
I don't use supplements because i want to get right the diet before anything else. 
I don't have any known health problem, my thyroid is fine.

1gj3wve,weightroom,[PROGRAM REVIEW] Tactical Barbell Mass Protocol (Grey Man) 7 Week Check-In,"Howdy Folks!

**INTRO**


* A few months back, I reviewed the Tactical Barbell Mass Protocol book and basically said it was THE book I wish I had started with and I regretted everyday I hadn‚Äôt read it up until that point.  Needless to say, I soon after started following one of the programs listed in the protocol: Grey Man.  Along with that, I‚Äôve been VERY diligent about complying with the instructions laid out by K. Black‚Ä¶with the exception of one area: nutrition.  Mr. Black is very much a fan of carbohydrates to drive up bodyweight, and, in the discussion of low carb approaches to mass gaining, though not explicitly forbidding it, he notes that he does not recommend such an approach.  I, however, have decided to completely ignore that advice and, instead, pursue weight gain while undertaking a carnivore style diet, which is what ‚ÄúOperation Conan‚Äù became: Tactical Barbell Mass Protocol training with carnivore nutrition, a blending of soldiering and barbarism.  It‚Äôs been 7 weeks so far, and I want to share my thoughts and experiences as they currently are, with room to continue to update.

**WHY DID I PICK GREY MAN?**

* The go to recommendation in Mass Protocol is General Mass, which is about as bare bones as it gets.  3 days a week you squat, do a weighted pull up, and bench press, and then on a 4th day you train the deadlift.  I am more than certain this approach would be awesome for many trainees.  However, coming into Tactical Barbell I was coming off my most recent strongman competition, wherein the training leading up to it had me really junk up a nerve in my right hip, and whenever I tried to squat heavy it would force me to regress even further into pain.  Grey Man has the trainee alternate between squats on 1 day and deadlifts on another, still training 3 days a week (so in 2 weeks, you squat 3 times and deadlift 3 times).  Deadlifts were NOT bothering my hip in a similar manner, and this meant I actually had time to recover between squat workouts and heal up.  Additionally, Grey Man rotates between the bench and the overhead press, and as someone with a few strongman ambitions left, I wanted to continue to train my overhead press.  Beyond all this, Grey Man is legit 3x a week, vs that sneaky 4th day of General Mass, and I really wanted to keep the lifting at 3x a week, and the supplemental movements allowed in Grey Man had it so I felt like I was covering all my bases programming-wise.  


* There are plenty of good programs in Mass Protocol.  Grey Man isn‚Äôt the best: it was just the best for me.

**MY SUPPLEMENTAL WORK**

* As previously mentioned, Grey Man allows the trainee to pick up to 3 exercises to form a ‚Äúsupplemental cluster‚Äù to train alongside the two main lifts of the day (in my case: squat and press, or bench and deadlift).  On the day that I squatted and pressed, I picked the incline DB bench press, neutral grip chin (weighted on the final 2 weeks, bodyweight on the first) and glute ham raises (bodyweight only).  On my deadlift and bench day, I did lever belt squats, weighted dips and axle curls.  I trained each cluster in a giant set format: going from 1 exercise to the other to the other before resting a minute and starting again.  I prefer this approach, as it‚Äôs faster, and tends to generate a decent metabolic hit.  

* A quick overview of the logic in my exercise choices: since I train in a home gym with a small training footprint, I can‚Äôt do lever belt squats and incline DB bench comfortably (I‚Äôd have to move equipment between exercises, making giant sets less viable), so those two don‚Äôt occur on the same day.  On the day I train deadlifts, I want something quad focused in my supplemental work, whereas on the day I train squats I want something posterior chain focused.  My back is getting heavy training on the deadlift day, so I don‚Äôt need to hammer it again with chins, and can instead focus on arms, and I‚Äôm focusing on arms/biceps because ever since tearing my left bicep I‚Äôve felt like it‚Äôs worth keeping them strong.  I also figure that it will help contribute toward my chinning ability.  It‚Äôs honestly a bit like a Sudoku puzzle. 


**MY CONDITIONING**

* I kept this incredibly vanilla and listened to K. Black‚Äôs recommendation: twice a week, I‚Äôd engage in a 60 minute walk on the treadmill at an incline.  4.0 was my default incline, and 3.5 was my default walking pace, but I‚Äôd play around with both of those depending on the day and my level of excitement.  Ultimately, these were recovery workouts, ESPECIALLY after the squat workouts.  The squat workouts aren‚Äôt particularly brutal for many, but with my junked up hip and a torn meniscus in both knees, training first thing in the morning, I‚Äôd always finish those workouts pretty stiff, and these walking workouts in between (along with some reverse hypers and hanging from a bar) would always have me feeling ready to roll come the next workout.  They really fell into Dan John‚Äôs recovery workouts that he talks about in ‚ÄúMass Made Simple‚Äù.

* On weekends, I‚Äôd engage in as much leisure walking as possible, simply because I feel like it‚Äôs the best physical activity we can possibly engage in, especially if done outside in the sun. Plus, I got a new puppy, and walking it is good.  On my birthday, I racked up 29.6k steps, just doing what I found fun.  Also, 3x a week, I‚Äôd attend an evening Tang Soo Do class, which, now that the whole family has moved up to the advanced class, IS a bit of a workout in it‚Äôs own right, and I had a few nights where I came home having broken a good sweat in the Dojang, but I don‚Äôt feel as though these detracted from my recovery‚Ä¶minus the time I got kicked in the knee in a sparring match, woke up the next morning unable to extend my leg, and had to postpone training to the afternoon.

* There was only 1 time I deviated from the plan, and that was after getting a wild hair and deciding I wanted to see how well I‚Äôd do on my ‚Äú5 minutes of burpee chins‚Äù protocol.  After 6 weeks of just walking on a treadmill, I came within 1 rep of my PR, [getting 55 burpee chins in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__MtXzzXAM0).  I felt like that was a good sign of the conditioning holding up.

**PROGRESSION**

* Another thing I dug about Grey Man was how I could approach the progression on it.  K. Black lays out ‚Äú4-5 sets‚Äù for the main work.  I took this to mean, do 1 cycle with 4 sets, the next cycle, do 5 sets, THEN up the maxes, start over at 4 sets, repeat.  I like this, because it allows me to progress for a long time on the same maxes and really ‚Äúown the weight‚Äù, vs racing to a stall.  For the supplemental clusters, no such option exists, so I would just up the weights on the maxes each cycle (5lbs for upper body lifts, 10lbs for lower body lifts).

**HOW I DEVIATED**

* Surprisingly: not by much.  Unlike many of my other program reviews, where I twist programs into horrible mutations of their former selves, I remained VERY compliant with Tactical Barbell, which honestly may just speak to the fact that I genuinely found the right program for me at the right time that I needed it.  I DID attempt to employ a mat pull ROM progression day on weekends, using a barbell, since I‚Äôve experienced success with that protocol in the past, but that honestly became a pretty hit or miss approach, as many weekends my training time was compromised and, in other cases, my hip pain was flaring up and I decided against actions that would make it worse.  In regards to that schedule, there were 2 weeks within the past 7 where I was only able to get in 2 lifting workouts in a week vs 3, so we can call that a deviation.  

* Otherwise, I added ab work to the end of every workout (3x10 standing ab wheels), which K. Black DOES say you can do, and, on bench days where I had extra time, some lateral raises (which CAN fall into the realm of shoulder health exercises).  Also, all of my ‚Äúdeadlifts‚Äù on the program are done with the low handles on a trap bar vs a traditional barbell.  I‚Äôve a VERY good barbell deadlifter, and I‚Äôm not very good with the trap bar, so I felt like it was worthwhile to spend time focusing on that (reference my previous writings on how training what you‚Äôre bad at is good for hypertrophy).  This was another reason I wanted to include that weekly mat pull workout: to maintain skill with barbell deadlifting‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs not the biggest deal.

* And this isn‚Äôt a deviation, since it‚Äôs allowed, but it‚Äôs worth noting that, along with Giant Setting the Supplemental Clusters, I ran the main work in a superset style.  In this case, I would rest 1 minute between exercises, but still alternate them (Squat, rest 1 minute, press, rest 1 minute, squat, etc).  Between this and the giant sets, training never lasted over an hour, and often I‚Äôd complete the required work in under 40 minutes, taking the extra time to train my abs.  And I got in a little sneaky grip work by hanging from a bar after my press set before my squat set, but this was less for grip and more for spinal decompression.  Which, on that note, I DID also include reverse hypers into my training, but as a warm-up exercise, rather than an actual exercise.  I found they were quite restorative to my hip.


**NUTRITION: INTERMITTENT FEASTING**

* Now here is where things go totally off the rail and brings the ‚ÄúConan‚Äù into Operation Conan.   It‚Äôs no secret I‚Äôve taken on a carnivore approach to nutrition (and my frequently declining readership numbers have alerted me that this is an unpopular choice, but I‚Äôve always been myself since the start of this blog, so here we are) and I had no intention of interrupting that for this program.  K. Black effectively says ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù if you try to do a low carb approach to gaining, so I took that as a blessing and went for it.

* However, an even more interesting pivot occurred around week 4 of the protocol, where I decided to experiment with another unique approach to nutrition: protein sparing modified intermittent feasting.  Yes, that‚Äôs a mouthful, but let me explain.

* One of the big reasons I took on a mass gaining protocol in general was that I was coming out of summer, wherein I had leaned out to the point of feeling kinda stringy, and there was an upcoming holiday season in front of me, starting with a late Oct birthday, then Thanksgiving, then Christmas, and after Christmas, we go on a Disney Cruise, wherein I intend to continue eating my face off.  It was THE most ideal time to start leaning into heavy eating and feasting.

* Well, as I got closer to my Birthday, and after spending some time traveling and living off of restaurant cuisine (still sticking with meats, but didn‚Äôt have the quality control I wanted), I felt like ‚Äúdrying out‚Äù a little.  Before this, I was eating 2 solid meals a day: a lunch and a dinner.  The rest of my nutrition came by way of Metabolic Drive protein powder (I don‚Äôt say ‚Äúshakes‚Äù, because I actually eat them, by mixing in a little bit of beef gelatin and hot water to create a sticky pudding substance).  Well, I decided to replace that middle meal with more Metabolic Drive and ONLY have 1 meal a day at the end of the day, effectively re-implementing the Velocity Diet/Apex Predator diet.  In the week following travel, I was able to keep that end of day meal a little lighter to re-establish my baseline, and from there I REALLY started leaning into the ‚Äúfeasting‚Äù portion of intermittent feasting.  Since I was only eating once a day, I got to eat a TON at these meals.  And I found out I REALLY dug that style of eating.  With 2 meals a day, I was eating a reasonable amount per meal, whereas now I could just absolutely gorge myself and eat until I was satisfied both from a satiety level AND a hedonistic level.  It was, actual, legit feasting, and it happened daily.

* I‚Äôve actually documented my weekly meals here in the r/weightroom weekly nutrition thread, so you can view some solid examples of the feasting here

https://old.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1g6dny3/foodie_friday/

https://old.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1g15gov/foodie_friday/

* I‚Äôll stop here for now, but I‚Äôve really tried to document the meals as much as I can through the process, so feel free to keep rolling back.


*SCHEDULE*

A simple breakdown of my weekdays would be

* 0400: wake up, train

* 0615: 2 scoops of Metabolic Drive with 1 tsp of gelatin

* 0930: Same as 0615

* 1230: Same as 0615

* 1730ish: FEAST

* 2030: Same as 0615

* Sometime in the middle of the night: a 1 scoop Metabolic Drive shake in water


* On weekends, I would do 2 solid meals a day: a breakfast and a dinner.  Both of these tended to be on the larger side, and I‚Äôd still have the evening Metabolic Drive serving and the middle of the night serving.  There was no training on weekends: I‚Äôd sleep in, and just engage in regular physical activity/walking.


* I will note that I do have ONE meal a week wherein I break completely from carnivore, and this meal tends to have a gracious amount of carbs.  Previously, I would use this as an opportunity for a ‚Äúcheat meal‚Äù, but the truth is, I legit love eating meat so much that there‚Äôs nothing out there in the realm of junk food that compels me to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù.  I‚Äôd have to actually force myself to eat that.  However, if my wife makes something at home, I‚Äôll definitely eat it, because I enjoy the family bonding of the shared meal, and we use some very quality ingredients in the stuff we make, compared to what you get when you eat out.  Often, these meals are pasta or casseroles, and I‚Äôll have some homemade cookies and some raw local honey to top it off.  This creates a cyclical ketogenic approach, which is, once again, very much in line with ‚ÄúApex Predator‚Äù.  I imagine many people are going to read this and go ‚ÄúSEE!  You NEED carbs to gain weight!‚Äù, to which my rebuttal is, if the ONLY carbs you need to gain weight is 1 meal a week, then we REALLY don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù THAT many carbs to gain weight.


**RESULTS SO FAR**

* I have recorded every single workout and [uploaded it to youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VCz6j4d_Ak&list=PLfcuGAffLlSc-iaZX2bPBhdDZaqT4aMEw&index=20) if you want to watch the live progression.  But I‚Äôve been able to progress on all of my lifts per the progression scheme I‚Äôve previously outlined, and haven‚Äôt missed any reps.

* I‚Äôve also grown in bodyweight, despite K. Black‚Äôs opinion on a low carb approach.  I‚Äôve done my best to weigh myself every Monday morning, but sometimes it just plain slips my mind (I‚Äôm not one to weigh myself usually), so I only currently have data between weeks 1-6, but in that time I went from 79.1kg/174lbs to 81.9kg.180lbs.

* And then, of course, the things that really matter: my wife says I look bigger, I‚Äôm filling out t-shirts more, but my lifting belt still fits the same and my abs are still visible.  I feel like the combination of the walking for conditioning, being zone II cardio that relies on fat as a fuel source, alongside the hard but brief training and my approach to nutrition have all been instrumental in allowing me to feast hard and stay lean through the process of gaining (feel free to watch the training videos for a reference point to level of leanness I‚Äôm maintaining while eating my face off each evening).


**THE FUTURE**

* I legit see no reason to stop training this way.  This is honestly the most content I‚Äôve been with a training protocol in a LONG time, and I STILL have the ‚Äúspecialization‚Äù phase to do!  There may be a time that I take on more of the traditional Tactical Barbell work to emphasize strength and conditioning, or get re-bit by the Deep Water bug, but I feel like this is going to be my baseline approach for the foreseeable future.  If nothing else, I plan to at least ride this out until my cruise around the new year, which I will treat as a ‚Äúbridge week‚Äù and roll from there.",2024-11-04 02:20:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1gj3wve/program_review_tactical_barbell_mass_protocol/

If you want a really long write-up regarding the training leading up to the comp, check [here](https://forged-by-iron.blogspot.com/2022/06/competition-write-up-2022-testify.html)

**PRE-COMP**

The whole week, I had been consistently weighing in at about 187lbs first thing in the morning, before any bathroom functions, training, etc.  By the time I‚Äôd use the bathroom, eat a light breakfast, train and shower, I would clock in at 181-183.  For some reason, 2 days before the comp I gained 3lbs and it wasn‚Äôt going away.  I woke up the morning of the comp post bathroom at 185.5, so I wasn‚Äôt in a bad spot.  I put on my winter gear (thermal base layers, sweats and a beanie), did 23 of Dan John‚Äôs ‚ÄúArmor Building Complexes‚Äù with 24kg kettlebells in 5 minutes and then paced in the garage for 30 minutes to get down to 184.5.  I pre-made breakfast, drove to the comp site and weighed in at exactly 185.0 with clothes on.  I have legit made weight at the exact ounce for the majority of my competitions: It‚Äôs become a talent.

On the subject of pre-making breakfast, this competition marked a while departure from my previous nutritional approaches and, ultimately, a sign I‚Äôve grown up.  I cooked up 2 whole eggs, 1 egg white, 2oz of lean meat (combination of chicken and pork), some sauteed peppers and onions and 50g of avocado on a low carb tortilla wrap with some fat free cheese and sour cream into a baller breakfast burrito that I eat pretty much every morning, sticking with the whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat differently on comp day compared to normal days‚Äù approach.  I also had a slice of keto bread with some sunflower butter on it‚Ä¶and, of course, an energy drink, because you can‚Äôt take that out of me.  Back in the day, this would have been pop-tarts or mini-donuts or some other sugary junk.  Through out the competition, I was eating celery with Nuts n More or sunflower butter on it, occasional bites of just plain Sunflower butter, and I made my way through 1 Biotest Finibar, eaten bits and pieces at a time.  I HAD junk food packed: a whole box of girlscout peanut butter patties and a 2-pack of cherry pop-tarts, but just never felt the need to eat them.  I used to eat an entire box of Pop-tarts at a competition: 2 in between each event.  I though I ‚Äúneeded‚Äù it.  The things we tell ourselves. I DID drink like a gallon of sugar free Gatorade, so there‚Äôs that.

**WARM UP**

To warm-up for the competition, I did 3 reps of an unloaded axle for clean and press, then 1 rep with 95lbs before the first event, and then, before the deadlift event at the end, I did 1 rep of 225lbs.

**EVENT 1: Axle clean and press away (205lbs for Lightweight men)**


This was one of several events I was cautious about.  At the start of my 7 week intensification block that led into this comp, I brought up my 250+lb Ironmind sandbag to practice some loading.  I hadn‚Äôt touched this thing in about a year, and of course I just gripped and ripped it and borked something in my elbow tendon.  I kept doing that weekly and the elbow kept not getting better, until one day when I‚Äôm fairly certain I tore something inside of it.  That was about a month before the competition.  At that point, I dealt with pain outside of the sandbag, and continentaling and pressing the axle really drove it crazy.  The last few training days saw the elbow getting better and better each time, but I also knew that a bad day was possible.

Whistle blew and I gingerly got the axle into place. Wasted a fair bit of energy in doing so, but my elbow felt good, and that‚Äôs what mattered.  Went double overhand because I still refuse to use mixed grip on a continental.  After that, I pressed out 6 of the ugliest reps I‚Äôd ever done in my life.  Watching the video, these weren‚Äôt even close to push presses.  It‚Äôs not too shocking: Push pressing was making my elbow hurt, because I was effectively ‚Äúcatching‚Äù the weight on my tricep, so a slower/smoother press suited me better.  The dude I beat in the other lane (who would eventually be the dude to chase the whole comp) was hitting some beautiful split-snatches, which made for an entertaining ‚Äústyle vs style‚Äù head to head: the brute vs the technician.  He managed 4.  I thought he got 5, so I got the 6th to seal it, then dumped the 7th.

Walked away feeling good and healthy, so that boded well.  Next was the one I was most concerned about: loading.

**EVENT 2: LOADING MEDLEY: 140lb stone, 200lb stone (both natural), 150lb sandbag, 200lb sandbag**

All events were a mystery leading up to this, and I was training primarily for heavy loading at first and then light loading afterwards to let the elbow heal.  However, what I wasn‚Äôt training was transitions, and that came to bite me, as watching the video I was clumsy and slow between implements.  I also bobbled the second stone and wasted a bunch of energy recovering it.  In general, I was sleep-walking through the event, just trying to play nice with the elbow.

I was a little miffed by an admin error: I should have gone last, since I won the first event.  Instead, I went second.  In turn, I had no appreciation for just how technical and fast the dude that followed me was.  He blew away my time by 4 seconds.  Part of me thinks I woulda tried harder knowing the thread he was, but it is what it is.

At this point, of the 3 of us, me and one dude are tied for first, with 1 win each.

**EVENT 3: 50lb Bag over Bar**

The only prep I did for this was kettlebell swings and snatches.  I hate throwing events, and part of my deal for this comp was to not train things I didn‚Äôt like.  It was rising bar, last man standing, take whatever attempts you want, starting at 8‚Äô.  I took every attempt, because I knew it was going to just be luck at this point.

8‚Äô barely cleared, as did 9 and 10.  I did a throwing event in 2018 where I launched stuff, but I trained for it.  Amazing x-factor.  The other dude missed 11‚Äô the first time but barely cleared it on his second go, so he took this event.

**EVENT 4: 100‚Äô Pick-up Truck Harness Pull**

I never cared for truck pulls, but this event was at least moving quick. I had my ‚Äúsecret weapon‚Äù of rock climbing shoes, which I think only 1 other athlete had.  They helped: I had a good grip on the floor for this, but I struggled to break the inertia of the truck at the start.  I tried a technique I had been using in training of pulling on the harness to start and get low, but, in retrospect, a better approach would be have a 4 point stance/bear crawl.  I threw my arms forward, which, again, was something I was using in my training to get my bodyweight moving froward and hips down.  I finished around 25 seconds and some change.  Guy I needed to beat was 1.5 seconds faster.  Heart break that one.  But I at least enjoyed this more than any other truck pull.  Not having the pull rope helps, and training for it showed me how awesome pulling a prowler with a harness is.  My conditioning also shined through: I was winded at the end and recovered by the time I walked back to my family.  Great to be in such awesome shape.

**EVENT 5: 515lb tire deadlift for 1, 395lb (combined) farmer‚Äôs handles deadlift for 2, AMRAP axle deadlift of 335lbs (no straps for any lift)**

More admin frustration in times never being announced for any competitors that, at this point, I had no idea if I had won the truck pull or not, but I also didn‚Äôt care about winning: I was there to be more trouble than I was worth.  This was absolutely my event for that, because I was going to pull deadlifts until the other dude caught rhabado.  I used an old trick of wrist wraps.  When you can‚Äôt use straps, wraps can help, because they‚Äôll force your hands to naturally close.  Every little trick you can use.

Pulling without straps always sucks, but I managed to get 515 moving with a little effort.  Once that was done, I used a trick I had employed before and jumped into the farmers handles to save some time, which put me slightly ahead of the other dude.  From there, got to the axle and use a thumbless grip.  It seems counter-intuitive, but taking the thumb out REMOVES a weakpoint.  Now you only have your 4 fingers to fail vs 1 thumb.  We were told touch and go was good AND I saw the judges were allowing bouncing, so I went full tilt and just banged out rep after rep.

I got called on ‚Äúsoft knees‚Äù on a few reps.  Ever since my ACL reconstruction, I can‚Äôt fully extend my left knee.  I may need to let judges know about that in the future.

The way they scored reps on this was by total, so we got 1 rep for the tire, 2 for the farmer‚Äôs, and however many after that.  I was credited with 16 reps total, the other dude got 14.  I still pulled the 17th rep, despite being told many times the event was over, because f**k you: I‚Äôm getting that rep.  

This event went great, and was really the one that re-lit the fire in me.  Being able to just go out and give it my all like that was a blast, and the challenge was exactly where it needed to be.  My conditioning held up real well, and despite no real grip training, I had zero issues on the axle.

**RESULTS AND WAY FORWARD**

As you‚Äôve been following along, this was a second place showing.  Could I have done things differently and gotten first?  Yeah.  Do I regret that?  Not at all: I met my goal of training the way I wanted to train and just treating this like another workout.  I trained the morning of, and I trained the next day (5 minutes of ABCs for 23 total, straight into 5 minutes of burpee chins, and then the ‚ÄúGut Check‚Äù WOD later).  I ate the way I wanted to eat, made weight the way I wanted to make it, and, through all that, found out I do still enjoy this sport and can still have fun with it.  Trying to ‚Äúbe a strongman‚Äù just wasn‚Äôt fun: ‚Äúdoing strongman‚Äù is much more enjoyable.  I don‚Äôt care about winning or nationals or anything; I want fun shows that push me hard and are a blast, and I‚Äôm gonna keep training and eating ‚Äúmy way‚Äù for them.  

And in that regard: I‚Äôve never felt better the day after a competition.  Still able to train hard and move well. 

Reference my previous manifesto: I got to live being more trouble than I was worth that day.  I showed up, I set the pace for the first event, I kept on the heels the whole time, I made the last event suck for the guy ahead, and I was absolutely positively yoked out of my absolute mind, having achieved that physique with no counting of calories or macros or martyrdom to speak of.  If I can walk into a strongman competition without training for it, having trained twice+ a day up until the morning of the competition, put up a good showing, and do it all again the next morning, I am absolutely more trouble than I‚Äôm worth.

And that‚Äôs the plan moving forward.  This timed out perfectly with a deload week after my intensification block.  I‚Äôm traveling right now, doing a few nights in a hotel before coming home for a day and then heading to San Diego to visit family.  I‚Äôm going to make due with dumbbells and kettlebells, keep up my daily ABCs, and then come back and get back to gaining with 5/3/1 BBB Beefcake.  I plan to do another long gaining block with diet breaks: Beefcake into 5/3/1 for Hardgainers into a 7 week diet break/intensification block, then Beefcake into Monolith into 7 week intensification, then Deep Water Beginner and Deep Water intermediate.  Should be pretty nuts.

laowrm,weightroom,"[Program (Challenge) Review] Dan John‚Äôs 10,000 Kettlebell Swing Challenge","So I just finished [Dan John‚Äôs 10,000 swing kettlebell challenge](https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/10000-swing-kettlebell-workout) and thought I‚Äôd write about my experience and results.

**KB weight:**

Being that I don‚Äôt have a 24 KG bell (the weight recommended for men), I used my 50 lb bell for almost everything.  Eventually, I started incorporating my 32 KG bell into some of the sets of 10 to make them more difficult.

**Breaking up the sets and grip issues:**

Firstly, I chose the 5 sessions a week for 4 weeks option.  It‚Äôs 500 swings for 20 sessions regardless of whether you do it in 4 weeks or 5, though.

I tried a variety of different ways to break up the sets.  First I tried the sets of 10, 15, 25, and 50...but the sets of 50 absolutely murdered my hands.  The next day I had horrible blisters on my pinkies and ring fingers because my hands are too big for all 10 fingers to fit inside the bell and whichever ones I put outside got rubbed raw.  This has never been a problem doing lots of swings before but doing several sets of 50 just seemed to push my skin over the edge.

So I experimented with the 15 and 35 swings for 10 sets and the 10, 15, and 25 swings for 10 sets but ended up using the second option most often.  I also started working in 1-arm swings during the sets of 25 because they really saved my grip (more grip work but easier on the hands as no fingers are outside the bell and getting pinched/rubbed).  I obviously found the 1-arm swings more challenging for the core, forearm, lats, etc.  It was nice to mix both 1 and 2-arm swings in together for the additional challenge and slight variety as this program gets pretty monotonous really quickly!

**Strength movements in between:**

I kept it simple and either did goblet squats or 1-arm KB presses.  Reps were 1, 2, 3 between every set of swings.

**Time:**

I treated the whole thing like a time challenge.  My goal was to rest as little as possible and constantly push the pace and improve my time.  The average session took around 30-35 minutes.  My fastest time was 22 minutes and my slowest, when I had a terrible sleep the night before and felt like crap, was 38 minutes.  I definitely felt myself getting faster and faster throughout the month.  To keep things challenging I started incorporating the 32KG bell for some of the lower rep sets of 10.

**Form:**

This challenge really helped me dial in my kettlebell swing form.  Obviously, doing 10,000 reps of something is going to grease the groove and dial in your form... provided you‚Äôre doing them right.  That‚Äôs the thing with 10,000 swings, though.  If you aren‚Äôt doing them right your body will let you know right away.  So doing that many reps reinforced a really nice hinge and plank pattern, over and over.  I also found really emphasizing squeezing the glutes and abs at the top in the plank kept my lower back fresh and able to keep coming back for more swings.

**Results:**

After about the first week and a half I started getting amazing endorphin rushes at the end. It was the high I‚Äôve gotten from running a long distance without the joint stress and usually in 30 mins or less.  Starting each session was hard as they were boring but I always felt incredible afterwards.

I saw some good physical results from this challenge.  I was going for better cardio and fat loss and that‚Äôs what I got.  My resting heart rate went from mid 60‚Äôs down to 52-54.  I was clocking my heart rate at at least 170 at the end of each session and one time at 190.  I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the hardest I‚Äôve worked cardiovascularly in a while.

I‚Äôm 100% convinced my grip, lats, traps, forearms, glutes, and lower back are stronger.  Obviously that‚Äôs pretty par for the course for doing 10,000 weighted hip hinges while holding a weight over a month...

The challenge helped me lose about 2‚Äù off my waistline and around 8 pounds over the course of the month (from 209 down to 201).  It helped me get my waistline measurement below half of my height (which is pretty welcome for me because I‚Äôve had an annoying flabby little pooch despite not being too big everywhere else for a while now).

Obviously, anytime weight is lost calories are ultimately responsible.  I did clean up my diet a bit during this challenge but nothing drastic; I didn‚Äôt count calories, didn‚Äôt start weighing out foods, and still had cream and sugar in my coffees.  Basically I just cut out crap like junk food that I know I‚Äôm not supposed to be eating, focused on getting in more quality protein, and drank more water.  However, I strongly believe the 10,000 swings aided the overall fat loss as the dietary changes alone were pretty basic.

Overall, I feel amazing after this challenge.  I think this is the best my cardio has been in years.  After my fingers got used to the grip volume and built callouses where they didn‚Äôt have them before (despite swinging KBs for a long time prior to this), the grip issue pretty much went away.  Other than that, I feel noticeably stronger in my glutes, grip, lats, etc. as mentioned before.

**Difficulty of finishing:**

This is the hardest ‚Äúprogram‚Äù (I know, its a challenge not a program) to finish that I‚Äôve ever done.  It‚Äôs not the physical difficulty of it...it‚Äôs the sheer monotony of swinging a kettlebell over and over and over again for 20 sessions. It really became an exercise in mental discipline more than anything else.  When I got halfway through I wanted to quit.  I was asking myself what the point of this is...  I‚Äôm pretty ADHD and always want to try new programs and ideas and had a million things I wanted to try when this one got boring.  Then I decided it‚Äôs a CHALLENGE and I need to just finish it.  I banned myself from reading about any other programs or challenges after that and decided to finish.  If nothing else, I decided I was going to complete it for the practice of mental discipline.  So I wrote out every remaining session in my journal and the reps I would do.  Then I had some accountability and realized I had to finish it.

**Would I recommend it?**

After all that...I honestly don‚Äôt know if I would recommend this challenge.  It‚Äôs pretty freaking boring and monotonous.  I mean, it had its moments when I would get into a real groove and a sort of zen-state but mostly it just felt really repetitive.  Eventually I started listening to cheesy pump up EDM mixes (which I never do usually) to push through it.

I wouldn‚Äôt even think about recommending this to someone who hasn‚Äôt been comfortably swinging kettlebells for enough time to build up a good hinge pattern and who isn‚Äôt VERY comfortable with the size of bell they‚Äôre going to use.

If you‚Äôre experienced enough, want a challenge that will absolutely tax your lungs and grip, and don‚Äôt want to have to think about how to structure your program AT ALL for a month, then perhaps it‚Äôs worth a shot.  Honestly though, you‚Äôd have to be pretty strange to actually enjoy this program.  I remember reading someone post that they wanted this to be their regular program every month.  I definitely cannot relate to that...  I got through it and liked how it made me feel afterwards but can‚Äôt really say I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the results and the endorphins afterwards but hardly ever enjoyed the workouts themselves.

The reason I tried it is because I haven‚Äôt been too consistent with my lifting in the last few months and wanted something 100% structured that I absolutely did not need to think about and that would kickstart me back into things.  For that, it worked well.

Anyways, hope someone got something out of the write up.  Now onto something with a little more variety!  I just need to get back into being consistent.  I‚Äôm thinking of a basic 5/3/1 setup with some kettlebells as assistance work as well.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be tempted to do high rep sets of swings for a little while, though. üòÇ

j65t8n,weightroom,[Program Review] Smolov JR first cycle,"TL:DR - After 4 weeks since gym opened I managed to get to a 90kg bench touch n go, ran smolov for 3 weeks and got 100kg for 2ct pause.

Background

22 years old uni student, 5'10"", bodyweight was around 88-90kg (194-198lbs). Started basic bodybuilding around 2 years ago and then switched to powerlifting roughly 1 year ago. Throughout the year bench has always been my weakest in terms of strength and form, which is odd considering my strict press is 80kg (176lbs). During that year I started out with a basic 5x5 and then swapped over to nSuns 5/3/1 and made amazing gains on my dead and squat.

My best gym lifts are :

High bar squat 160kg (353lbs) 

Bench 100kg (220lbs) this was touch n go, bum off the bench

Sumo deadlift 185kg 

Training

4 weeks after gyms had opened I managed to get back some decent strength on all my lifts but I knew my bench was awful, 90kg touch n go felt like absolute hell and so I wanted to sort it out now because I wanna be able to bench confidently in the long run! 

So I decided to pause all my reps and really focus on correcting my leg drive and upper back stabilisation, this worked amazingly for me as every week felt easier and easier (Although week 3 day 3 really kicked my arse). I also found out that my gym partner gives amazing hand offs which really helped when I decided to max out.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jxSlYB8?fbclid=IwAR0FzvmicwvAtlTF5vDgmgaoXTHlwnNG5KI002PhC3mZCMp9i1Hp0ENnGAw) is a video of week 4 day 4, which was 10 sets of 3 @ 85kg (188lbs)

For accessories I did a lot of lateral pulldowns, hammer curls, face pulls and rows, these were done on the lighter bench days 1 and 2 of each week. On the heavier days I focused on leg accessories, but I did not squat or deadlift much, maybe once or twice during this routine but that was mainly due to an issue with my tailbone.

For stretching I mainly focused on my lower back and legs, again due to my tailbone issue but I also did lots of shoulder dislocations before and after working out.

For warm ups it consisted of mainly face pulls and close grip lat pulldowns.  

Diet

I have used myfitnesspal for a long time so eyeballing food has kind of come naturally to me, but for this program I knew calories were needed. I stuck to hitting a goal of 150g MINIMUM protein everyday, 4g of omega 3 from tinned sardines (They slap with pesto mayo) and literally anything else whilst keeping it about 70/30 healthy food to junk food. I probably averaged out to 2500-3000 calories daily.

I also make my own preworkout as it is way cheaper, here is a list of ingredients!

300-400mg caffeine (only used this on day 3 and day 4 of each week)

4g L-Citrulline

1g Taurine

20-30g Dextrose

2g Vitamin C tablets (Mainly for flavour but also a bit of vitamin C does not hurt) 

Maxing out

I gave myself a week off benching and did some light squats, deads and bodybuilding style workouts. I realistically never planned to max out as I wanted to run another cycle, I did not feel confident at all to try and PR but my friend basically pushed me to do it. 

Here is how I maxed out

Empty bar 20kg (44lbs) 2 x 8 This honestly felt awful, felt stiff af

40kg (88lbs) 2 x 5 Again did not feel too great, mainly just stiff

60kg (132lbs) 1 x 3 Surprisingly felt much better

70kg (154lbs) 1 x 1 This was the moment where my confidence came back, 70kg is not heavy in general for me but it felt like benching 40kg so I knew today was the big day!

80kg (176lbs) 1 x 1 Again felt like nothing

90kg (198lbs) 1 x 1 This moved ok but unracking the weight my right shoulder came loose and so I lost a lot of upper back tightness

95kg (209lbs) 1 x 1 The difference in getting a hand off by my friend made this lift that much easier than the previous one, I honestly never realised how much a hand off can change a lift!

100kg (220lbs) 1 x 1 Again the hand off really helped keep me tight, lowered the bar slowly and let it sit on top of me for 2 seconds and the bar came up slowly, I did struggle to lockout but we got it!

Final Conclusion

Smolov Jr is an amazing program, not only did I hit a big PR but I also changed my bench form completely! I had no injuries during this program and I actually quite enjoyed running it, so I will be running it again for another cycle. Apologies for not having a video of my PR, unfortunately I don't know how to record video whilst listening to music on iPhone!",2020-10-06 14:16:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/j65t8n/program_review_smolov_jr_first_cycle/
j1r6u4,weightroom,Program Review - Jim Wendler's 531 BBB (Boring But Big),"Hi everyone - this is my first time posting in the r/weightroom community, hopefully this is the right format. I figured I‚Äôd share my thoughts on this program having run it for most of 2020.

**Background**

I‚Äôm 30 years old and have been lifting weights on and off since I was around 18. I won‚Äôt bore you with the details but like many of you tried a million different programs on T-Nation/Bodybuilding/EliteFTS/etc but had my first real success running Madcow 5x5 (I was about 160 lbs and got to around my current weight of 190). I realized 4-5 years ago that simplicity is what works best for me, and ran Stronglifts 5x5 for a couple of years before transitioning into Martin Berkhan‚Äôs leangains program (modified to 2 sets) while I was trying to drop weight from around 210 to 190 (I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô11‚Äù and not an NFL running back so that weight doesn't work for me). Heading into 2020 I wanted to do something new and had heard/seen Jim Wendler‚Äôs name around the internet for years but never actually researched or did any of his program. I looked into it and as you can guess, loved the simplicity. This coincided with me actually building my own platform and installing a power rack in my home so I didn‚Äôt have to drive to the gym 4 days a week for a \~45 min workout (little did I know COVID was around the corner so this was quite lucky).

**Why 531 BBB (Boring But Big)?**

I felt like I had gotten to a point with 5x5 where I was plateauing, and the PRs were harder and harder to come by ‚Äì it starts to get to a law of diminishing returns unless you‚Äôre willing to put on more weight, and I just didn‚Äôt have the energy to put up 5 sets of 5 reps with these big compound lifts EVERY OTHER day. Leangains was good because it kept my strength levels up while I lost weight, but again, it‚Äôs not as simple as 531 can be, not to mention some workouts are over an hour and I‚Äôve found my sweet spot to be about 45 minutes.

**Routine/Modifications**

I purchased and read the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0557248299/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0557248299&linkCode=as2&tag=petermichauxc-20&linkId=JQQJ3PDCGKK5SXI7). Essentially this program is focused on the 4 main power lifts ‚Äì overhead press, deadlifts, squats, and bench press ‚Äì 1 day for each lift + assistance exercises (or, for the BBB template, 5 sets of 10 reps of that compound exercise at around 30-50% of your max). Here‚Äôs how I set my weekly routine. Jim and folks online act like the calculations are easy but I‚Äôm not that smart, so I used [this template](https://blackironbeast.com/5/3/1/calculator) to calculate the first 4 week cycle. I modified this slightly as I wanted to focus on Dips and Chins, so instead of the chosen assistance work I just superset everything with chins/dips (depending on the day) and try to beat my previous record.

**Monday**

\- Overhead Press 531

\- Overhead press 5 sets x 10 reps (pick a weight)

\- Chins

**Tuesday**

\- Deadlift 531

\- Deadlift 5 sets x 10 reps

\- Dips

**Wednesday ‚Äì Rest**

**Thursday**

\- Bench Press 531

\- Bench press 5 sets x 10 reps

\- Chins

**Friday**

\- Squats 531

\- Squats 5 sets x 10 reps

\- Dips

**Saturday and Sunday ‚Äì rest**

**Diet**

I didn‚Äôt really focus on a specific diet ‚Äì I‚Äôve never really been one to be able to stick to it. Having done leangains in the past and meticulously counted my calories in myfitnesspal, I am somewhat familiar with my macros and calories per day, but I did not track it and I would be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt eat a decent amount of junk food (what else am I supposed to do quarantined at home).

**Progress** 

\*This is for around 8 months (I have slacked off a bit since late July)

\*These are my ‚Äútraining‚Äù 1RMs ‚Äì meaning what I peaked at during a workout, and not a true RM. So it‚Äôs not an exact 1RM but you get the idea of progress

||**Starting 1RM** |**Finishing 1RM** |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Body Weight|199lb|193lb|
|Deadlift|285lb|320lb|
|Bench|245lb|285lb|
|Squat|250lb|285lb|
|OHP|170lb|210lb|

&#x200B;

**Thoughts/Comments**

¬∑ Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with this program and I‚Äôve seen the biggest gains over this period of time since I got back into Stronglifts 5x5 in 2015. However, unlike that program, I haven‚Äôt seen the plateaus. That‚Äôs probably partly due to diet (I‚Äôm not really in a deficit), but I think it also has to do with spacing the workouts out and focusing on low reps and a high amount of weight.

¬∑ After each 4 week cycle, instead of going back to the template, I simply added 5 lbs to my calculations/goals for the next cycle. This is an inexact science and I know it‚Äôs not the exact way to run this, but it worked for me and I knew it would make gains.

¬∑ When I stalled, I made a note of it in my notebook and kept the weights/reps the same for the next cycle until I could actually beat it.

¬∑ I was probably not aggressive enough in adding to my squat and deadlift goals, as I know I‚Äôm lagging behind in those areas, so your mileage my vary.

¬∑ I‚Äôve really noticed a difference in my shoulders, arms and chest. I attribute a lot of this to the chins and dips ‚Äì when I started out I was usually supersetting at around 6-7 dips and 4-5 chins, and now I am usually around 10-12 reps depending on how I feel.

¬∑ I hate cardio and didn‚Äôt really do any of it other than the occasional Peloton session so I‚Äôm not sure how it could impact your workouts and energy levels over a week to week basis but I imagine it would be a bit tougher to make gains without compensating with your diet.

¬∑ As much as I would get annoyed heading into a deload week, I have to admit I think they are a big reason for why I was able to hit PR after PR. The other programs I‚Äôve run in the past haven‚Äôt really had a properly built-in deload, which meant it was on me to manage it around the 10-12 week mark (and obviously I didn‚Äôt do it ‚Äì which led to overtraining and plateauing).

**What's Next?**

¬∑ I‚Äôm sticking with this program ‚Äì I‚Äôve again modified it slightly. Instead of doing the 5x10 BBB component, I‚Äôm doing assistance work on specific areas (bb curls, close grip bench, etc). I am keeping these in conjunction with the 531 4 week cycle ‚Äì week 1, 3x10 @ specific weight, week 2 3x8 @ previous weight +5 or 10, week 3 3x6 u/previous weight plus another 5 or 10, week 4 deload.

Hope this was helpful for some of you. Bottom line, in the 10+ years I‚Äôve been lifting this has been my favorite program and one that I think I can run for several more years whether my goals are gains or just maintenance.

isp81z,weightroom,[PROGRAM REVIEW] BUILDING THE MONOLITH & 6 WEEK HILL SPRINT PROGRAM,"&#x200B;

**CONTEXT/PERSONAL INFO/GOALS**

First time runnning the famous Building the Monolith. For those who don't know this program has being around for quite some time now and since 2016 this  subreddit probably never stopped to receive review's every single week, for very good reasons, it's hard, it's fun and very effective, especially for those who want to gain some weight like me. I also was looking for doing some hard conditioning work and Josh Bryant program 6 WEEKS HILL SPRINT came in hand, although Windler expressly advocate against Hills in this particular program, i decided that was a ""good idea"".

**INITIAL STATUS**

**Age:** 22

**Height:** 6'1 

**Bodyweight:** 173-174 pounds

**Previus program:** Boring Bug Big Beek Cake >>> **Squat/Bench/Deadlift/OHP:** 90kg for 3 reps/74kg for 1 rep/140kg for 4 reps/56kg for 2 reps

&#x200B;

Ps: I was coming back from a period of sickness, i recent had a rare case of acne fulminants induce by isotretinoin use(who would know, right) so don't be scared with the scars of my before-after pictures(i'm going for a deadpool kinda of look) 

&#x200B;

**THE PROGRAM's** 

Both program's will challange you a lot, physicaly and mentally, Btw tooked me a average of 5 hours a week totally( 150 minutes on day one, 90minutes on day two and 60-90 minutes on day three). I obviously do not rush anything because i current have the time for that, so even though i was supersetting dips and chin ups for example , i rest 1-2 minutes beetween each set. 20 reps squat only get real challange at the final week.  Deadlift was my worst lift, my lower back did not recover fast enough beetween workouts. For face pulls I did 10x10 on day one and 5x15-20 on day three. For Shrugs generally i stick with dumbells, up to 75 pounds dumbells for 12-15 reps. For curls, hammer curls and incline curls. 

I never regulary did Sprints before, much less Hills Sprints, so this was very challange for me, luckly i have a training partner wiht motivate me to keep going forward evey week. First week i thought that i was going to die lol its like a feeling of drowing beetween each set, begging for air. But  luckily i started to get better by week 3 and even try harder hills. Overall, very fun program, sometimes its good to have something different of a gym enviroment and with a partner, the competitive sprit seems to work very weel on hills. 

I did Joe Franco's Limb 11 for warm up for Btw and Bryant warm up recommendations for Hills. 

&#x200B;

**DIET + SUPLEMENTS** 

I eated like a madman. I picked up the largest plate i have in my home and eat until i *almost* want to puke (for lunch and dinner).

Breakfast: 5-6 eggs, with cheese, bacon , milk.

Lunch: Generally 3-4 pounds of food (rice, ground beef, potato and veggies) and grape juice 500ml

Dinner: Same as Lunch

Before bed: 5-6 eggs, sometimes with some carb source, like wraps.

I don't know the calories, probably something 4000-4500kcal. At the end of week, i alow my self to eat some junk food, like burguers, pizza or barbecue. 

Fish oil, ashawagandha(450mg 2x), l-theanine, caffeine, zinc, magnesium, vitamin d3, vitamin c, melatonin.

&#x200B;

**RESULTS**

&#x200B;

**BW:** 185 pounds( +11 pounds) 

**Squat:** 96kg for 5 sets of 5 reps.

**Bench:** 74kg for 5 sets of 5 reps.

**Deadlift:** 140 for 3 sets of 5 reps.

**Ohp:** 56kg for 5 reps. 

**Weighted Chin up:** 25kg for 3 sets of 5 reps.

**Dips:** 120 reps PR(20x6) 

**Face pull:** 30kg for 10 sets of 10 reps.

**BEFORE-AFTER/VIDEOS:**  



I may be overhelming optimisc but i don't think i gained any substancial amount of fat and for what i have seing i made good gains on traps, back, neck and arms departamant. I'm very happy with the results and i looking forward to another hard program, what you guys recommend? i'm thinking on sticking with fullbody workouts because i think that i respond very well to high frequency training.",2020-09-14 17:12:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/isp81z/program_review_building_the_monolith_6_week_hill/
i98wxy,weightroom,Program Review -- Original Lillebridge Method,"I just finished my first cycle of the original Lillebridge Method.  I am posting this review because I could not actually find a review online written by anyone who had actually tried the program, just a couple of ""guru"" types bashing it after looking at the template.  I decided to try it because the Lillebridge family have had so much success.  My biggest concern was that I am not on real gear, and although they haven't come out and said they do, they compete in untested feds and look like it.  I do take conservative TRT, with frequent blood tests that range between 600-800.

**PRE-PROGRAM STATS**

I tested my maxes two weeks before starting the program so these are fairly accurate.

Age: 44

Weight: 225

Squat: 465 ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5aDM-Cb6xU) is a video of me squatting 455 right before lockdown)

Bench: 305

Deadlift: 505

**THE PROGRAM**

It's a very simple peaking program.  The entire e-book is like 15 pages and really could be a spreadsheet with a couple pages of instructions.  The gist is that you squat and deadlift on the same day, alternating which one you are doing heavy each week (i.e., squat heavy, DL light one week, reverse the next).   You bench heavy one week and light the next.  The template is based on a percentage of your maxes, and the percentages go up every week.  It's a ten-week cycle, with the last two weeks being a deload and then a testing week.  One thing that is strange is that on heavy deadlift and squat days, you work up to one heavy AMRAP set, but on heavy bench days you work up to three heavy singles set up like the three attempts at a powerlifting meet.  There is no explanation for the difference in the way bench is treated, so I'm not sure why they have it that way.

In addition to that main part of the template, the program includes a ton of bodybuilder style assistance work, where the have you doing 5 sets of 15-20 for exercises like cable flys, skull crushers, leg curls, etc.  There is also some accessory work specific to the main lifts, like board presses and front squats, but these are also high rep and light. In the past I haven't really done any accessory work other than variants of the major compound lifts, so this was new and led to a lot of DOMs in my smaller muscles for the first few weeks.

I ate whatever I wanted to during this program, just making sure I got sufficient protein.  I usually eat fairly clean and continued to do so, but I ate junk food more often than usual and also just ate a lot more volume during the ten weeks of this program.  I didn't track anything, but I would be surprised if I didn't average 5000+ calories per day.  The only supplements I took were creatine and collagen.

**PROGRAM RESULTS**

It worked.  I just tested my maxes today, the day after my 45th birthday.  I only took videos of the squat and bench because I didn't have a good spot to put the camera for DL.

Weight: 235

Squat: [500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyXAQDQfMvE)

Bench: [315](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x85sLuenDco) (had more in me, but I made too big of a jump based on how easy this felt and missed 340)

Deadlift: 535

**OVERALL**

This is a great, simple program that worked very well for me.  I haven't made progress this quickly in several years.  The frequency was very low, and I felt like I was barely working with respect to the main lifts for the most part and didn't really expect the kinds of lifts I hit today.  All-in-all, it is hard to argue with the results.  The one thing I might change next time I do this program is to do more of a controlled bulk so I don't get so fat and add in some conditioning work on off days.  Although the recovery time was great, I feel like I'm quite a bit worse than my baseline when it comes to cardio and conditioning at this point.  I plan to try Eric Lillebridge's off season program next while cutting off some of the fat I gained.",2020-08-13 21:39:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/i98wxy/program_review_original_lillebridge_method/

Again, be warned that these are NSFW.

 **MY BACKGROUND** 

Please see my post for The Famine for general athletic background:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/dm9el9/program\_review\_jamie\_lewiss\_feast\_famine\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/dm9el9/program_review_jamie_lewiss_feast_famine_and/) 

I will add that for The Feast, I started at 212 lbs and ended at 228.8 lbs.  So, I gained about 6 pounds over the full 8 week ""program"".

 **BRIEF PROGRAM OVERVIEW** 

Part 2 of the Feast, Famine and Ferocity program, The Feast, is 4 weeks of eating and training like a monster.  Jamie recommends 20 calories per pound of body weight, or if you want to go REALLY big, 25 calories.  He also points out that Halfthor does 27 when he bulks.  lmao.  The other food requirement is that 35% of your calories need to come from protein.  In addition to all of the food, there are 5-6 days of heavy training.  Jamie gives a template in the Feast Training Routine post, but says that it's Chaos and Pain so do whatever you want.

I'm sure I'm forgetting some stuff, so if you have any questions lay 'em on me and I'll do my best to answer.  In all honesty, this can really be summed up as ""guy lifted a lot and ate a lot and gained weight and got a lot stronger for a month"", but I like reading the write-ups as much as the next guy and maybe you'll find some nuggets of wisdom in there.

 **HOW I DID IT**

For the food, I stuck with the 20 calories/lb.  Every week, I re-weighed myself and re-calculated out the calories/protein for each week, then planned my meal prep accordingly.  I think I went the entire program with only eating out twice - I really enjoy cooking and Jamie has some dank recipes.  Check out his Stew Roids posts if you want some inspiration.  I specifically loved the Mexican lentil stew recipe, and the pulled pork pot pie (recipe in the Feast Overview).  My eating looked something like this:

6am - 1 cup oats with peanut butter, honey and protein powder (pre-workout)

8:30am - Protein shake and banana (post-workout)

10am - 1 cup greek yogurt with berries and honey + 6 hard boiled eggs 

1pm - stew or pasta

4pm - stew

7pm - stew

Generally my calories fell between 4000 and 4500 a day.  I typically drink a fair amount of beer each weekend, but had little to no urge to eat pizza or ice cream or any of my other typical junk foods.  I cooked 2-3 days a week, which was super fun.

 **MY EXPERIENCE/STRENGTH GAINS/RULES/SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE THOUGHTS/ETC.**

First off all, I will say the first week was really tough still.  I was still feeling depleted from fasting, so it took a while to get the wheels turning.  Once they did though, oh man.  Weights started flying up and I felt like I could see myself growing daily.  Weights that felt hard just a few months ago I'm hitting with no problem.  

I ran the program that Jamie lays out pretty much to a T.  I did make a few changes:

1. I did power cleans for all the heavy pulls.  Not really a change but just FYI.
2. Instead of Anderson Squats, I did pause squats on day 1.  Same rep / set scheme.
3. Instead of the barbell curls on day 3, during the last two weeks I just did lighter hammer curls.  Felt like I got a better pump that way.
4. For the pullups/chinups on Day 1, I did the same reps/sets as he has called out for dips on day 2 because I like weighted pullups a lot.
5. For the ""dealer's choice"" curls on Day 5, I did 5x10 chinups.
6. I went heavy on shrugs, but certainly did not hit 125% of my deadlift 1RM.  
7. On the optional fill-in day I did conditioning.  Lots of burpees with ring pullups, airdyne sprints, whatever.  I laid off the running completely in an effort to actually let my foot heal, which it finally has.

I also developed a few ""rules"" as I went along - note, these were not things I decided on beforehand, but just became the routine I got into:

1. Rest times.  Typically I do a lot of giant sets, but I took Jamie's note regarding resting as long as you need to attack the next set and decided to take each set as it's own thing.  I started with 3 minutes between sets for the ""main"" lift each day ( the first one) and 2 minutes for everything else.  I would increase that to 4 for individual sets if I felt I needed it as things got heavier, and I would take 5 after a failed set, which happened a couple of times.  Note, I didn't count fails toward the total volume.
2. Weights.  I started with what seemed appropriate and just increased by 5-10 pounds each set as I felt I could.  Each week, I made a rule that I had to start at my heaviest weight from the previous week for that lift.  This was the best thing I did on this program - it seemed really freaky and first but in sticking with that rule it forced me to face the fear and execute anyways and I made some huge gains because of it.  

My hamstrings/glutes, upper back, arms and obliques I feel just ballooned running this.  All my clothes fit funny now haha, though I'm actually one belt hole down from where I was starting the famine, so it looks like the weight, in general went to the good spots.  

I haven't done any testing yet, but the main thing I'm noticing with regards to strength gains is how much more solid I feel now.  Weights that used to feel shaky now go up smoothly and confidently.  On squats specifically, I think I can credit a lot of this to the amount of hamstring work called for in this program.  I haven't done a ton of hamstring specific work in the past and I think it really paid off over these 4 weeks.  I've never really ""felt"" my hammys/glutes working during squats but I certainly did by the end of this program.

I will also note, that I was incredibly beat up at the end of this.  Just about everything that I typically tweak is tweaked, and some things I don't typically tweak.  That being said, I'm about a week into a short rest period, and I'm already feeling quite a bit better so I don't think there are any lasting injuries.  It was also cool, and I credit this to the food intake, that minor tweaks seemed to heal up insanely quickly.  As an example, I pulled my neck pressing one week, a feeling that I've had before that typically takes a couple of weeks to go away, and it was gone within 48 hours.  

One more cool thing - I typically don't do ""lifting only"" programs because I'm always so worried about getting out of running shape.  However, due to the nature of this program and also wanting to get my foot healed up, I decided not to run for the full 4 weeks, which was crazy to me.  However, I just ran a 3 mileish run at the same pace I was running that distance over the summer so I really didn't lose much there at all (though my legs were really sore at the end of it).  This shows me that I can take a couple of weeks off of certain aspects of training in order to give 100% focus to another, and then come back after the couple of weeks and get right back on the horse.  Huge realization that I think is going to pay dividends going into the future.  

I will say I'm feeling a bit chubby towards the end.  I'm going to keep the bulk up, but take it easy on the fucking carbs for a few weeks.

 **WOULD I RUN IT AGAIN / WHAT'S NEXT**

Yep, definitely.  With the famine too.  In the context of the full 8 weeks, I think that starvation period is necessary.  Did it produce more muscle gain than I would have gotten by just doing 8 steady weeks?  Maybe, maybe not, but the whole thing was certainly fun as hell - especially once I started feeling like I was popping off in week 2 of the feast.  

I'm currently in the middle of a short rest-up period over the Thanksgiving Holiday, but then I will be starting Building the Monolith next week.  I'll run the first three weeks, take a week off for Christmas, then run the final three weeks.  Feeling a tad out of shape after this so I'm going to run it Mythical Strength style with all the giant sets and really push the conditioning.  After that, the plan is to do another cycle of F,F and F, but plans can always change.

In conclusion, I had a lot of fun the past 8 weeks.  This was the shake-up I needed in my training and I certainly got bigger and stronger as well.  Mentally, I feel like I'm on a new level.  From being able to say no to hunger for days at a time to being able to just get under a heavy bar and execute set after set, I've pushed myself farther than I have before and I'm already seeing the benefits.

Thanks all for reading, and have a Happy Thanksgiving.",2019-11-27 15:48:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/e2htev/program_review_jamie_lewiss_feast_famine_and/
dcuppc,weightroom,[Program Review] Benching the Monolith,"*Disclaimer: First real post by a long-time lurker,I am NOT a native speaker so please forgive me for any mistakes.*

This is a program I stumbled across on Liftvault.com. According to the website all the credit goes to u/BenchPolkov. I link the spreadsheet here [Benching The Monolith Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19CnjYQ0_HJZyK1LM3m-0Wxio-4U5g6oSEHbHWxPVr5w/edit#gid=317684689)

**Backgroud Info:**  
I am hitting the weights since around mid 2016. I played sport my whole life (basketball, soccer). Had two major injuries during the last 3 years (all dealing with my ankle), first one occurred during the Building the Monolith program party here, second tear of bands last Christmas. I‚Äôm nowhere near an advanced lifter and had to work back a lot from injuries.

**Why I choose this Program:**   
after getting my heart broken by my ex this summer I decided I need something grueling and challenging, mainly get my mind free and be challenged and pushed to limits. I was also preparing for basketball season meaning training session of 2 hours 2-3 times per week.

I had Building the Monolith in mind and after googling for a Spreadsheet I found Benching the Monolith, which basically switched the Bench and Press portion of Wendlers Original Program.

**Stats before/after the Program:**

    Weight:   101 kg, 222lbs    -> 105 kg, 231lbs    
    Height    193 cm, 6ft3      -> unchanged
    Bench:    102.5 kg, 231lbs  -> 110kg, 242lbs
    OHP:      62,5kg, 137lbs    -> 67.5kg, 148lbs
    Deadlift: 150kg, 330lbs     -> 170kg 375lbs
    Squat:    105kg, 231lbs     -> 140kg, 308lbs

(All time Squat PR was 130kg, but after my ankle injury earlier this year I needed to start working it back up with proper form)

**The Programm:**  
The Version I ran was with 85% TM for Press, Bench, Squat and 90% for Deadlifts.As I said its basically changing the Press and Bench Sets, as well as some accessory work.

Typical week schedule: 
(all numbers are %tage of TM)

Monday

* Squat - 70x5, 80x5, 90x5, 90x5, 90x5, 90x5, 90x5
* Bench - 70x5, 80x5, 90x5, 90x5, 90x5, 90x5, 90x5
* Chins ‚Äì 100 total reps
* Face Pulls/Band Pullaparts ‚Äì 100 total reps

Wednesday

* Deadlift - 70x5, 80x5, 90x5, 90x5, 90x5
* Overhead press - 70x5, 80x5, 90x5, 70xAMRAP
* DB Rows ‚Äì 5 sets of 10-20 reps
* Curls ‚Äì 100 total reps
* Dips ‚Äì 100 total reps

Friday

* Squat ‚Äì 70x5, 80x5, 90x5, 45% x 20
* Bench ‚Äì 10 sets of 5 reps @ 70%
* Chins ‚Äì 5 sets of 5 reps (weighted)
* Face Pulls/Band Pullaparts ‚Äì 100 total reps
* Shrugs ‚Äì 100 total reps
* Tricep Pulldown ‚Äì 50 total reps

**Changes I made:**  
 I only changed the Chins back to 5x5 like Wendler does in the Original (the spreadsheet did call for 100 unweighted).

**Conditioning:**   
As stated I played basketball at least 2 times a week for 2 hours. When I did not have a weight training session or basketball training scheduled I did some light conditioning like the Airbyke. I allowed myself to have one off day during a week.

Sometimes I had to switch scheduling around due to weekend activities and basketball games on Sundays. This resulted in days where I would lift at 12 and then had basketball training at 6. Those days were hard, but I actually felt great sometimes playing ball after heavy squats.

**Recovery:**   
I tried to foam roll every day (which I didn't), had one tight spot in my rear delt which I hammered with a lacrosse ball, went well some days some days it didn‚Äôt.

Sleep was not so good the first 4 weeks, this caught up to me in week 4/5. I sometimes felt asleep in the morning again for 3-5 hours after 7 hours during the night.  
I think accumulated fatigue was real in the last part of the program and definitely a point of improvement for the future for me.

**Food:**   
I tried to eat close to Wendler‚Äôs diet by eating 10 eggs a day and 500 grams ground beef. All in all, I stuffed myself with all food I found, especially in the later stage of the program, with a lot of junk food and stuff which are high calorie dense.

**What went well:**  
This program did some really good things for my physique and work-capacity, but the real deal was the mental aspect of the training during a not-so-great time of my life. I always had something to look forward to during the day and was really excited for all my workouts, pushing me hard and they gave me the feeling of achieving something (even if it is just a little pleasure in pain after squatting). This was great for my chest developing, also felt that this high volume helped my shoulders grow along side with the chest.Squats feel good again, no more bothering from former ankle injuries.Also, great back development.

**What went not so well:**  
Looking bad my nutrition was bad, could count as a dirty bulk and resulted in some fat gain. I also didn‚Äôt put as much work into recovery as I should have. Not foam rolling and stretching every workout, I feel there is so much room for improvement.

**Conclusion:**  
Absolutly loved the last 7 weeks and would recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge and gain some muscle.

**Going forward:**  
I am kind of temped to run the programm again, and then cut a bit.Any other recommendations are welcomed in the comments J

938h8i,weightroom,"[Meet Report] Man of Steele Classic - Spring Valley, San Diego County, CA (x-post from /r/strongman)","**Background and Training**
I am a 40 year old male, 315 pounds and in the super-heavy-weight open division. I have been competing in powerlifting and strongman for about 4 years. I have a crew of about 5 of us that train 3 days between Monday and Friday, and every Saturday we practice strongman events. We utilize a food prep service for our daily lunches and eat a substantial meal for dinner. None of us were worried about cutting to make weight, so we all maintained our weight during the training and meet prep. I write down the programming for everyone in our crew and I follow concepts from renaissance periodization and we work in four-week blocks, hypertrophy, strength, endurance and strength-endurance.

**Meet Prep**
The last four weeks of training is dedicated to competition prep. We have to peak different disciplines in different ways. The clean and press was peaked for max strength, medley for conditioning, deadlift for endurance, yoke for weight and the atlas stone for endurance. I made sure to cut down on all junk food 2 weeks prior to the comp. I also cut off all caffeine the week leading up to it. This helped a lot with my mental focus.

**Meet Day**
We made sure to prepare the nights ahead so we wouldn't have to scramble out the door. Our anxiety and nerves were already fried anyways. Weather reports showed it was gonna be a hot, humid day with a UV index of ""Extreme"". I burn easily, so we already made sure we had our 100 SPF sunscreen packed. We made a small breakfast of oats. I can't stomach too much food on competition day, so I make sure I am well fed and hydrated the week leading up to it. Oats are easy for me to eat and they provide a steady stream of energy for several hours. We packed up bean burritos, pb&j sandwiches, fruit grain bars and of course, sour patch kids. We made sure to bring some pico limon for extra salt intake and glucose tabs to replenish carbs after every event. Competition nutrition is super important because it's a long day and you don't have much time to eat a full meal, so you must make sure you are eating and hydrating throughout the day.

We met up at Iron Mongers Gym and loaded up Brian's truck. Headed out about 6:45 am and got there around 7:35 am. It was a pleasant drive and the closer we got, the more nervous I was getting. I'll never get used to those pre-comp nerves, but it's a reminder that I'm alive and that I'm about to do something I'm potentially terrified of. I signed up as a Super-Heavy-Weight in the Open division. We checked in, registered, picked up our goody bags and t-shirts, then proceeded to setup our canopies and stake our claim at the competition. It was fun setting up our canopies next to our friends; Christina and Erik; Anthony, Ray, Mikey and the rest of the California Strength crew. I try to keep my eyes down and not bug anybody because I know it's already nerve-wracking just being there. The rules meeting began shortly after we setup and splayed out our belongings. It turned out that our MC was none other than Travis Ortmayer and he did a great job throughout the competition. We had about 15 minutes to finish warming up, so we quickly scrambled to the field and put our hands on the axle for the axle clean and press event. I was only able to get 3 sets in, but my last warmup was at 285 pounds. I lost the rest of my team during warmups, but it looked like everybody was in the same boat I was in. Warmups were short and sweet!

**First event: Axle Clean and Press**: 3 max attempts on a rising bar format with 20 pound increases between attempts. One drop and you are out. No pressure, there! During training, I had a problem with dropping the axle during the transition from belly to shoulders. I had to make sure, this was not gonna happen. I opened up at my previous PR, 300 pounds. They called my name, I picked up the axle, placed it on my belly and cleaned it up to my shoulders, then locked it out overhead. Phew! First event will not be a zero! Had to do 320 for my next attempt. A 20 pound jump on my PR. I was ready to do this and this was what I wanted to come home with. 320 pounds on the bar and my turn is up; I picked this one up and locked it over head even faster than the 300. I was where I wanted to be, personally, and my arms (brachioradialis) were burning up. I decided to not go for a 3rd attempt at 340 pounds because I wanted to save my energy for the rest of the comp and I did not want to get an injury on the first event. Dale, a staff member I look up to, later came up to me and told me he thought it was a smart play. That made me feel better about my decision. I tied with second place on this event.

**Second event: 275 Keg, 275 Sandbag and 550 Sled Medley**: Carry the keg 50 feet, run back and carry the sandbag 50 feet, then drag the sled back 50 feet. The sandbag was looser than I was used to, and the pick I practiced with did not seem like it would work with this bag. I decided to change my pick method at the last minute to the dreaded bear-hug method. Whistle blows and I pick up the keg fairly easily and carry the keg 50 feet down. I ran back to the sandbag and bear hug it up but it slipped off my legs. I pick it up again, and got enough purchase to start moving with it. I make it down about 40 feet and with each step my body is leaning more and more forward and I dropped it. At this point I feel like I am about to puke, but I swallow it down and bear hug it up again and finish the last 10 feet. I am worn out, no energy, can't breathe, but I have to finish the sled. I grab the handles, get set low and pull as hard as I can and my feet slip from under me on that turf. I take a more vertical stance and start pulling the sled again and I get about 10 feet down and I hear ""FIVE!"", I tell myself I can get 3 more feet here, but then the judge says ""No! TIME!"". Oops, I thought she said five. I put the handles down and it took over 30 minutes to recover from that brutal event. My left QL was screaming at me and I was really hoping I didn't strain it. I went back to our canopy and proceeded to roll out, bitch, complain and recover. This event hurt my standings. I only got 7 out of 17 points and it set my placing pretty far back.

**Third event: 500 Axle deadlift for Max Reps in 60 Seconds**: In training I hit an easy 8 rep set at this weight and I was ready to hit 12 here. They were allowing touch-and-go deadlifts, so my strategy was to hit 3 mini sets of 4 touch-and-go-reps. Well, the first mini set went well, but once I stopped doing touch-and-go reps, I couldn't do it anymore and was left to doing single reps. I got 11 reps total and the last one was a questionable lockout. Judge said ""Down!"" though, so it counted. I shared 3rd on this one with 3 people so I didn't do too bad, just not how I wanted it to go. My tired QL definitely limited what I could do here. I was worried how it would feel during the yoke, but I just went back to the canopy, rolled out and did the best I could to prepare myself mentally for the yoke.

**Fourth event: 750 Yoke 100 feet with a Turn at 50 feet**: Lower back and QL were so tight coming into this, but I was determined to finish this event. ""Ready! Set! Go!"" I get my feet under the yoke, pick it up easily and walked about 2 feet while the yoke stayed in the same damn spot. Reset and picked it up again. Slowly, painfully move forward on squishy ground that felt like I was walking on marshmallows with 750 pounds on my back. Each step was a determination to move forward without dropping or buckling under the weight. I get it down the 50 feet, set it down and get under the yoke again. This time I wasn't gonna let it drop until I finished. I got it down to about 49 and a half feet and my forward momentum seemed to just stop. I lurch forward, putting the front of the yoke on the line, straining my 2nd toe on my right foot in the process. I finished it with the 2nd slowest time, but there were many who could not finish this event. I was upset at my time and how this event went and I only got 8 out of 17 points which was another setback for my standings.

**Fifth event: 340 Stone for Max Reps in 60 Seconds over a 52"" Bar**: At this point in the game, Anthony and I are tied for 4th place and I knew I had to match or beat his number of reps. 3 reps was the number to beat when Anthony went up and he got 4. I knew I had to get at least 4 reps. I get the first 3 reps pretty easily and the 4th rep was a grinder. I put the stone in my lap for a 5th rep and stumbled back about 4 steps coming off the platform. I roll the stone in place and quickly attempt again. The stone comes up to the bar and won't budge. I was not in a good position to keep pushing and the stone fell. I yell out ""Time?!"" and I hear Travis Ortmayer yell out ""Seven seconds!"". I tell myself ""I can do this in 7 seconds"" and quickly get the stone in my lap and against the bar. I am at a stand-still and I went to grab the bar to get some leverage and as soon as I take my hand off the stone, it falls and my chances for a 5th rep fall with it. Shared 3rd place on this event with Anthony. I am still beating myself up for not finishing with a 5th rep on this one.

Aftermath: We were finally done. 12 weeks of training. One day of full-on back-breaking, gruelling and exhausting work. We met up with Christina and Erik; Ray, Mikey, Anthony and a couple other dudes from the California Strength crew at Oggies. We relived the day over beer and pizza. I don't know if it was just from the work we put in, but that was some damn good pizza! Felt so relieved now that we finally have a chance to take a week off to lick our wounds and set our next goals.

**Results**
I wound up sharing 6th place with Anthony and we were both pretty happy with that coincidence. Valarie, my lovely wife, got first place for her division! It was a proud moment and I couldn't be happier for her. She trained her butt off and it paid off big time. She was the only one to get the 190 stone in her division.

**Final Thoughts**
I would change how I peaked for the yoke and the medley. I should have peaked for speed on the deadlift instead of peaking for weight. I could have finished a lot faster than I did. I also think I should have trained the medley better. I was too stubborn with keeping the weight heavy and I should have dropped down the weight and endured the suck.

I'm still hungover as fuck and my body feels wrecked from the shit I've put it through for the last few days. I guess now's as good a time as any to type up this report. 

I'm 28 years old and have been training specifically for powerlifting for 3 years now. This was my 3rd meet and the last time I competed was November of last year.  I had wanted to compete in April but it fell on the last weekend before tax season ended and since I work for a CPA that wasn't going to happen.  I found out about this meet at the end of April and signed up as soon as the entry form was posted. It was at my home gym, Genesis Strength and Fitness in Paducah, Ky and was the first meet the gym's held.  Iron Mafia put it on and they did a great job.  The place was [completely packed](https://instagram.com/p/6IND-dEFNu/?taken-by=ironmafia_4brosgym) and was [standing room only](http://imgur.com/VUaSqZD) for almost the entire day.  

**Training**

My November meet was my first meet at 181 and I barely made weight by the skin of my teeth.  Had to get butt ass naked on the scale and errything.  I totaled 1265 and was fairly happy with it considering the programming I'd been doing myself leading up to it hadn't gone very well and everything had been feeling like shit.  After that meet I decided I was going to run the new [Sheiko universal 4 day program](http://sheiko-program.ru/forum/index.php?topic=313.0) I had recently heard about.  I ran it exactly as written including the set and rep schemes for the accessory work for the first 12 weeks.  When I got to the 2nd week of the transmutation phase I hit a [455 squat](https://instagram.com/p/yqTSzSPj8m/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) for a 20lb PR, a 290 5lb paused bench PR and a shaky [305 touch and go](https://instagram.com/p/yviHOXPj1B/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) PR.  I had also switched to conventional pulling after doing sumo exclusively for the previous year and [matched my sumo PR of 545](https://instagram.com/p/yvtZgqvj0p/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) but [missed 585](https://instagram.com/p/yvhjXhvj0M/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky).  This is where I fucked up.  

I had read about [Chris Duffin's Whisky and Deadlifts](http://www.kabukiwarrior.com/whiskeyanddeadlifts/) and brought a 5th with me to the gym that night.  When I missed 585 I got pissed and tried 2 more times, once conventional and then again sumo for the hell of it.  Both times I got it about 4 inches off the ground and stalled hard.  Then, in a moment of stupidity, I let my temper get the best of me. I decided to rep out 500 which I got for 3 or 4 and then I sulked around the gym and drank more whiskey.  I went home, drank more whiskey, didn't eat any food or consume anything but more liquor and went to bed.  I do not recommend ever doing this. I was wrecked for about a week and took a month off of deadlifting and just squatted and benched and hit some rep PRs.  

After that I restarted Sheiko from scratch and planned it to end right at the meet.  I still ran the work sets as written but I was more free with the accessories and generally added in a lot more volume and picked 2 or 3 muscles I wanted to hit.  When it came time to test maxes at the transmutation phase I hit a 455 squat again, but missed 475.  I also hit a 295 paused bench but missed 315 and I didn't test deadlift because I was scurred.  5 weeks later in the final peaking phase, and 4 weeks out from the meet I hit a [465 squat](https://instagram.com/p/5Slu1wvj0w/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky), [300 paused bench](https://instagram.com/p/5OLK3lvj1s/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) and a slow [555 deadlift.](https://instagram.com/p/5OKE9bvjw_/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky)  

**Diet**

12 weeks out I was weighing around 195 and knew I needed to clean up my diet if I was going to compete at 181 again.  I started eating [1-1.5lbs of 90/10 ground beef](https://instagram.com/p/5qEEfmvj39/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky), 6-12 eggs and a [chocolate avocado protein pudding](https://instagram.com/p/4S17Yhvj-e/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) every day with a weekly carb up of beer on the weekend. I found that at about 3k calories a day I could maintain my weight and lean out a bit.  I always skip breakfast and eat about a pound of beef for lunch with hot sauce and/or mustard, train at 5 when I get out of work, get home and eat another 1/2lb of beef with the eggs and then have the pudding before bed.  I vary the number of eggs I eat between 6 and 12 depending on how much [peanut butter](https://instagram.com/p/3697Z5vj69/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) I want to eat with my pudding.  

The ground beef diet worked really well and I'm going to keep doing it moving forward.  I'll add in potatoes or rice or some other carb though and I'll set the amount of carbs to coincide with my activity levels.  My body seems to respond really well to a higher fat diet.  I'd tried the lower fat, higher carb and grams of protein/bodyweight route and hated it.  I felt like shit and couldn't stand all the chicken breast.  This is probably the most bro thing I'll ever say, but there's something about beef that makes me feel strong, even when I'm eating <50g carbs a day.  Even when the macros and calories are the same, when the bulk of my daily protein and fat intake comes from beef I feel way better than if it's from chicken, pork or whatever.  Chris Ewing, the owner of Genesis turned me onto it and I've become a huge advocate.  It's cheap (90/10 beef is $3.78/lb in Paducah and I spend about $40 a week on it) easy to prep (I just put salt on it and cook it in my grandma's cast iron skillet) and tastes great.  The only downside is I spend ~$30 a month on assorted mustard and my apartment smells permanently of burger, but I'm ok with that. 

**Weight Cut**

On Friday, July 31st one week before weigh ins I was 190. From then on until weigh in I ate nothing but ground beef and mustard and started drinking 2 gallons of water a day.  On Monday and Tuesday I got 3+.  Wednesday morning I started taking a diuretic every 6 hours, drank 2 gallons of water and weighed 193 that evening.  Thursday I took a diuretic at 7am, 1pm and 5pm and only drank 2 bottles of water and cut it off at 5pm.  A couple of us hit a sauna that night and when I was done [I weighed 179.2](https://instagram.com/p/6ELuXnvj3X/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) and was probably the leanest I've ever been. In hindsight the sauna was probably over kill as I weighed in at 176 the next morning.  Whoops. Even though it was overkill it makes me feel better knowing I have some room to grow and still compete at 181.  

After weighing in I immediately started drinking water and pedialite and slammed 4 donuts in the parking lot along with an Imodium ad, a tip I picked up from Caitlyn Trout. A few of us went back to Chris's and did nothing but [eat](https://instagram.com/p/6EL--yvj30/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) and nap all day.  I ate a ton of junk food, [cookies, brownies,](https://instagram.com/p/6F9NZ_PjwX/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) peanut butter M&M's, burgers, brats, [a few beers with my pedialite](http://imgur.com/FPC3glK) and went full GOMAD on some delicious whole milk that I hadn't had it months. I also took another Imodium that afternoon. They say you should limit your junk and sugar intake on a refeed like that but I've never had any problems.  I didn't get sick or get diarrhea (thank you based imodium) and felt recharged and rejuvinated when I woke up 12lbs heavier on Saturday. 

**The Meet**

Went 6/9 (giggity) PR'd everything and finally got a 400+ wilks total.  

Squat

425 - Miss.  It was close but high.  [1st Angle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEBMi1oibo8&feature=youtu.be)  [2nd Angle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIb0TSrYEXg&feature=youtu.be)  I know there's a circlejerk about SPF passing high squats and quick bench pauses but this meet and every SPF meet I've ever seen have been strict as fuck for judging.  The judges were not shy in handing out red lights and they were very strict, but fair.  

425 - Make.  [I sunk it this time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaS39wMN2jM&feature=youtu.be)  

465 - [Make.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh60v5wVXoI&feature=youtu.be) Ties gym PR and is a 30lb meet PR.  If you like grinders you'll enjoy this.  

Bench

[280 - Make. No problem.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me8VRbaGGA4&feature=youtu.be) 

300 - Make. Ties a gym PR and is a 15lb Meet PR.  I'll edit in a video when I find one.

310 - [Miss.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OnP19XJNSA&feature=youtu.be)  Just not strong enough.  My arms and shoulders are weak proportionally to the rest of me and they'll be getting a lot of extra attention during this next training cycle. 

Deadlift

525 - [Make. Easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJVTAz1H19k&feature=youtu.be)  Followed it up with 2 shots of Wild Turkey 101.

565 - [Make.](https://instagram.com/p/6LVc0Svjyu/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky)  10lb gym PR and 20lb meet PR.  Cue 2 more shots of the 101.  

585 - [Miss.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcTsB3oUdJk&feature=youtu.be)  Again, just not strong enough.  

**Results**

Ended up with a 1330 total which was good enough for [1st place](https://instagram.com/p/6I_6j3Pj-D/?taken-by=matthew_church_ky) in the 181 open. The announcer and everyone else were amused when I walked up to accept it in mah kitty singlet with the Wild Turkey in hand.  

**Moving Forward**

I'm going to run Sheiko again.  All the volume and sets and have done wonders to improve my technique and confidence under the bar.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to any intermediate to advanced lifter looking for a program.  I'll be tailoring the accessories to address my specific weaknesses (baby bird arms and shoulders) and maybe throw in some extra calf work too, because [God knows I need it.](http://imgur.com/cTeHjGy)

2xp02y,weightroom,[Meet Report] 2015 USAPL Virginia Classic at The Weight Room in Richmond Virginia 227.5/117.5/227.5(502/258/502ILB)@ 82.5 (182 ILB),"Hello,

On Saturday, my home gym in Richmond Virginia hosted a powerlifting meet. The gym is ~100 people, and nearly half the gym showed up. It was a truly incredible experience which I have documented below. I hit two PRs and was very close on bench. I got called for hitching on a deadlift 3, but check out the lift I think its good! Most importantly, I got to spend the day in an incredible atmosphere, I knew like half the people there and got to share my meet experience with a lot of my closest friends from Richmond. Such an incredible day/meet!

Background: 

Age: 26

Height: 5'8

Gender: Male

Weight: Walk around at 185-190, dropped weight for competition. I weighed in at 82.4kg, just under. 

PRs: Squat: 496, Bench: 264 Deadlift: 524 Sumo, 500 conventional in gym. This was my first meet doing conventional. 

Venue: This was my home gym, so I was pretty familiar with the ins and outs. I literally can walk to my apartment from there, so I went out for breakfast and lunch, which was nice. Usually meets are so fast and/or I am unfamiliar with the territory that I have to rely on bringing my own food. 

Squat: I have hit 496 twice in competition, and failed at 507 twice. My goal was to get the 500 pound monkey off my back. I was originally going to do 474/502/513, but I changed to 468/485/502. I had a fewreasons for this:
-I did feel the refs were a little strict
-There is no heat in the gym. It was a little chilly, and I was making weight.
-The state squat record for the weight class was 480. If I hit the state squat record twice, I could make the joke to my friends that it sounded like ""a broken record"". I have said this joke at least ten times and I get a laugh every time. I am gonna be a great dad someday r/dadjokes would approve of this move.
-I had 5 non-lifting friends there. I REALLY didn't want them to see a failure, or have to explain depth and disagree. This made me be more conservative. I think that it was a good thing!

First Attempt: 468 pounds. I forgot to breath. I saw the squat command and just went. It came up awkwardly but easily. Video below
Second attempt: 485 pounds. This was HARD. I paused for about half a second halfway up, and powered through. I called 502 next, but a little bit of me thought theres no possible way I could get it. 
Third Attempt: Gym is going nuts. I'm about as jacked up as I have ever been. The lift is significantly easier than the 485. I am not sure I could have gotten this if not for the atmosphere though. It was incredible. I've failed at 507 twice. Once for depth(I was not deep enough but very close) and once I feel down with 507. The place went nuts after, the video doesn't capture. Video below. Play with sound for full effect.

Bench Press: 
First Attempt: 247 pounds. This was pretty hard actually. my left arm went up first, but it went up fast. The pause for everyone was a solid two seconds. By far the longest pause I have every experienced.
Second Attempt: 258 pounds. This lift was VERY difficult. It probably took three or four seconds to get the bar up. Given the two second pause I consider this a PR! I almost didn't try on attempt 3.
Third Attempt: 264 I never had any chance. could barely get the bar off my chest. No videos.

Deadlift: First two were simple. 474/502. First time lifting conventional. Let me talk about that decision before getting to the third attempt. I hit 524 sumo in August, and I hit 500 in the gym conventional a few weeks ago for the first time, knowing that there was a few pounds left in the tank. Without getting into the sumo/conventional debate, I think that everyone should train/compete as they like. I like conventional a lot more than sumo, and I was willing to lose 10-20 pounds on a deadlift to compete conventional. I think that it feels more natural, and is better on your body, at least for my body type. 

Third attempt: Went for 513. Check the video. I got two red lights, one white. I think its borderline and I understand the reds, but I'm considering it a PR! I am more proud of this than any lift that I have ever done. 

Overall: Amazing meet, amazing time, 2 PRs and woulda had one on bench if the pause was half a second as opposed to 2 seconds. I don't think that anyone hit a bench PR there, so I am happy with 5 pounds below. The meet lasted about 12 hours. Afterwards I had two beers, which were my first since Christmas I also ate junk food all day yesterday was great. Awesome time!!

13hbql,weightroom,"Program I made to fix my muscle imbalances and progress foundation strength, critique!","Have done lots of lifting before in my teens, then got into yoga, pilates, gymnastics, breakdancing, ballet, bunch of physical stuff. Did starting strength for about 4 months consistently, and got some good gains before getting lazy and fucking around, now I'm back in the gym and also wanting to correct problems I had before.


**Goal: Fix muscle imbalance issues. Cut down to about 10% body fat. Increase strength where I can. Maintain/Increase flexibility and core strength**. When I'm at 10% bf I plan on focusing on doing a slow bulk while maintaining low bf.


Age 24

190lbs

5 ft 10 in

~%15 body fat

mostly sedentary lifestyle

**Current lifts:** 

Squat: ~170 x 5, was up to 220 this summer but my hips started rocking and right leg took over, now I can't do these without my right hip+legs overpowering them completely, even if I concentrate on pushing through my left leg. The problem is also inherit in the lack of glute/hip muscles on my left side.


But my Split Squat was 50lb per leg last week. I can do more but then my back leg or dominant one starts trying to help.

Overhead press: 120lb x 5

Deadlift: 185 x 5

Bench: 200 x 5

**Eating Plan**: Leangains/Intermmitent Fasting with higher carbs on workout days, and higher fat on rest days, avoiding bread, gluten, wheat, sugar, sweets, junk food, and alcohol for the most part. 

Getting carbs mostly from rice, nuts, vegetables, and beans, but will get pasta or bread if I have no choice and I need to hit enough for the day.

I usually try to lift fasted after ingesting BCAAs or ASSAULT Pre-workout, then getting a high-protein, high-carb meal in right after.

So far went from %20+ to ~15% bf in a little over 4 weeks.

Now on the workouts: I love squats but I had a major hip/leg surgery in my left leg when I was a kid, so the right side of my body has adjusted to be very dominant over the years, especially my lower body. No matter how much I focused on pushing equally on both legs, and even de-racking a few times, the right side of my body always take over and feel like it did all the work. It just kept getting worse the more I squatted til I was limping after leaving the gym because I'd feel huge pump in my right leg but not my left.

I replaced the workout with split squats, and have been doing 6-8 reps to get more of a feel for it, and to get comfortable balance-wise before doing higher weight. Also, are BSS the kind of workout to do heavy, 5 rep sets with? I felt my back leg assisting too much (especially when my right was behind, trying to push down to help me up) with higher weights, so I'm doing lighter do concentrate on the standing leg doing more of the work, 


 
**Workouts: Variating ABA, BAB weekly **

**A:** 

Split Squats 3 x 6-8

Bench Press 3 x 5

Deadlift 1 x 5

Pullups or Chinups 3 x 10



**B:**

Split Squats 3 x 6-8

Overhead Press 3 x 5

Weighted Dips 3 x 10 

Back/Ab/Core work for ~10-15mins

**I was thinking of adding the following:**

Single Leg Extension

Single Leg Hamstring Curl

*Squats: Just 1 set of 5, once a week. I got cocky and did a full 3x5 set and felt my muscles out of balance again.

wexbv,weightroom,5/3/1 working for everything except bench...advice please,"I've been doing Wendler's 5/3/1 for about a year now and everything is dandy except the bench. I've seen significant gains on my squat, deadlift, and overhead press. I've gained a shitload of muscle mass as well. 

The problem is that I've also been experimenting with my diet over the course of the past year as well. Usually I'll make some decent progress on the bench, and then I'll tweak my diet even the slightest bit and my bench tanks back to where it was a year ago. Then I start back up again and repeat the cycle. The only way for my bench to go up *consistently* is to eat a lot of junk food everyday and get my bodyfat greater than 15%, which is too high for me, and I don't like the feeling of way overfeeding every day because I wake up bloated, gassy and feeling out of shape. 

It's been a year now of following 5/3/1 to a T and I'm over it. It's not helping my bench. Now, I know what you're going to say: you're probably doing too much and I should roll back on volume and eat more. That's what Wendler would say, I'm sure. But I've tried everything I can think of: no assistance work, little assistance, medium amounts of assistance, tons of assistance. I've tried benching only every other week of the cycle. I've tried close grip bench. I've tried lower volume variations on 5/3/1 and I've tried the higher volume variation (where you do your three work sets, then pyramid back down and do set 2 and set 1 again). I've deloaded and worked back up multiple times. Pushups, dips, pull-ups, flys, supersets, everything. I've tweaked my form to perfection. My row is way outpacing my bench so I don't want to start seeing imbalances in my physique or threats to safety and athleticism as a result. 

Does anyone have any ideas for a different loading protocol on the bench that I can use while still doing the 5/3/1 protocol for everything else? The other bench routines I've looked up all seem to be predicated on doing that routine for all the other lifts as well.

u6gi7,weightroom,"[Meet Report] First meet! F, 24, 5'4"" 123lbs, 505lb total. Summer Slam 5 in Peabody, Massachusetts","**Background and Training**

* Started lifting 6 months ago using Starting Strength. Switched to something Texas Method-y about a month and a half ago
* Take fish oil, creatine, vitamin D, a multivitamin, and whey protein powder.
* Nothing special about my diet - I try to get plenty of protein, and I'm working on eating more fruits and veggies.
* Swam and ran cross country in 5th-7th grade, but this is my first real sport since then.


**Meet Prep**

I found this meet browsing [PowerliftingWatch](http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/). I did a bunch of research, bought a singlet and knee socks, and felt like I almost sort of knew what I was doing by meet day. I brought a lot of food to the meet but ended up being too nervous to eat most of it.

I wanted to hit the 123lb weight class (I was about 126lbs) so I started slowly dropping calories and cutting out junk food a month out. I was generally weighing in under 123 the week of the weigh-in, but I did some water cycling and avoided carbs and sodium the day before just to be sure I wouldn't miss it.

My program has a weekly ""taper"" built in, so I didn't change much about my training to prepare for the meet. I'd normally do a really heavy but short day on Wednesdays, and I toned it down a little for my last workout before the meet.


**The Lifts**

I was surprised at how well I lifted - I guess the adrenaline was really helping. My previous PRs only added up to 470 so this was a big jump for me.

I did all my openers at weights I wasn't worried at all about hitting so I could focus on following commands and getting used to the new equipment. That was a great decision.

I ended up making every attempt, so I probably should have challenged myself a little more and tried higher weights.


**Squat**

* 155 - Went up easy, as I expected
* 170 - This was my previous PR. It was tougher but it wasn't much of a problem.
* 180 ([video, a little long, sorry! the rest are short](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV2mTuhnXy0&feature=youtu.be)) - I wanted 175, but they laughed at me and said I should try higher. Glad I did! This was tough, but I bet I could have done 5lbs more.


**Bench**

* 80 - Again, easy
* 90 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZC0Wnj5-FU&feature=youtu.be)) - My previous PR. This felt a lot easier than last time I did it.
* 95 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p4iiXDcS9k&feature=youtu.be)) - I've attempted 95 over and over in the gym and failed, so I didn't want to shoot for 100 yet. Hopefully I'll hit it in a couple weeks!


**Deadlift**

* 190 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_I5ufoWv7A&feature=youtu.be)) - Easy
* 215
* 230 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNKNGJlxrUg&feature=youtu.be)) - My original plan was to shoot for 225, but I felt like I was on a roll. Plus, the state record for my weight class was 225 and I wanted to beat it. I did! This was 20lbs higher than my previous PR.


**Final Thoughts**

I was pretty nervous, but I'm really really glad I decided to try this. Everyone was very nice, just like the internet said they would be.

Again, I wish I'd challenged myself a little bit more with the weights. These were all solid PRs though and I'm proud of them.
