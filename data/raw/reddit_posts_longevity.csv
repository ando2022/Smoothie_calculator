1m0oxl0,gainit,(16)67kg/148lbs to (18) 82kg/181lbs to (24) 103kg/227lbs 8 year progress post [184cm/6‚Äô 0.5‚Äù],"My training is based on heavy compound lifts, focussing on functional strength and longevity. 

For the lower body: ass to grass high bar squats, sumo deadlifts, RDLs, + various accessories. 

For the upper body: weighted pull-ups, dumbbell presses, free weight and machine rows, + accessories.

This is the core of my training that has remained unchanged for these 8 years. I‚Äôve tried different accessory movements, variations of the compounds, volume frequency and intensity, and the manner of periodisation in my program, but the basis has remained on these movements. 

My diet has always been intuitive, aiming for good quality protein sources and supplementing with 1-2 Huel shakes (since 4 years ago). This puts me in the range of 160-180g of protein a day, and although I don‚Äôt track my calories, I gauge and regulate how much I eat based on my bodyweight trends and visual bodyfat estimation. 

Happy to answer any questions in the comments! Thanks :)",2025-07-15 18:01:55,https://i.redd.it/9cngy393v2df1.jpeg

1mv9cx2,Supplements,How would you split these longevity supplements between morning and evening?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been into biohacking and longevity for quite a while now, and over time I‚Äôve started working with both [DoNotAge](https://donotage.org?dna_link=549) and [Edubily](https://edubily.de/?ref=BENE) (two great companies in my opinion). As a result, my supplement collection has grown quite a bit.

I know some people will roll their eyes and say: ""Look, that‚Äôs exactly the kind of customer these companies love!"" and that‚Äôs fine. At the end of the day it‚Äôs my personal choice to take these supplements, and I stand by it.

I combine them with other parts of my routine like cryotherapy, HBOT, red light therapy, strength training, and sleep (as much as possible with a baby daughter at home üòÖ).

To stay consistent, I use two supplement boxes: one for the morning and one for the afternoon/evening. I can‚Äôt realistically add a third slot, so I only take supplements twice per day.

Here‚Äôs how I currently split them up:

Morning

* NMN
* Resveratrol
* TMG
* Quercetin
* Sulforaboost
* Berberine
* CoQ10
* Omega 3 (DoNotAge version)
* Milk Thistle
* Glycine + NAC
* Vitamin D3 (5000 IU) + K2
* Black Garlic Extract

Evening

* Spermidine
* Collagen Peptides
* Creatine Monohydrate
* Apigenin
* Magnesium (Edubily 2:1:1 Complex)
* SIRT6 Activator
* Taurine
* L-Carnitine
* Premium Vegan Omega 3

To all the pros here on Reddit: would you change the timing of any of these? For example, take something in the morning instead of the evening, or the other way around?

Any feedback is appreciated üôè",2025-08-20 08:47:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mv9cx2/how_would_you_split_these_longevity_supplements/

1mtqasc,bodyweightfitness,How would you complement strength training and running for building athletic body?,"Hi, I'm 37M. I only started working towards being fit after 30'. Before that I was overweight my whole life (not obese though) and never into sports (except eSport ;) ). I've been doing resistance training and running quite consistently for about 1,5 year now.  I'm getting pretty satisfied with my physique and would like to just move better, with longevity as my primary fitness goal. Recently I started to dislike feelings of soreness and stiffness, especially in my lower back.

My weekly training regime consists of:

\- 30-40 km running, mostly aerobic and threshold runs. Sometimes I switch a base run for a bike ride.

\- 1 fullbody, mostly bodyweight: 3x6-9 ring pullups, 3x7-9 russian pushups, 3x 5-8 pistols (not full ROM yet), 2x ring triceps extension, 2x dumbbell hammer curls, dumbbell lateral raise, hanging leg raises

\- 1 pull workout, recently more oriented towards explosive pullups to unlock muscleup: explosive bar pullups, false grip rows, pike compression (trying to unlock L-sit as well), dumbbell or ring biceps curls, calf raises with kettlebell

\- 1 push/leg workout at the gym: flat bench or dips, back squats, machine chest press, RDL, cable triceps extension and pushdown, lat raises

\- 1 session of stretching, mostly static

Sometimes some exercises get switched between days, but it's generally pretty consistent. I guess I should also mention that I've got some problems with my wrists (mostly flexion), probably after an injury as a teen.

I'm very curious what would you switch out or include, again with focus on healthy body (as I'm approaching 40). I've been considering yoga, movement, animal flows, mobility drills - what do you think would bring me the biggest health benefits?",2025-08-18 16:06:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1mtqasc/how_would_you_complement_strength_training_and/

1mhwhr6,longevity,Reprogramming aging: genetically enhanced mesenchymal progenitor cells show systemic rejuvenation in primates,"FOXO3 is a well-established regulator of longevity, stress resistance, and stem-cell maintenance [4‚Äì6]. In a pioneering effort to reprogram aging-related genetic circuits, Liu‚Äôs group introduced two phospho-null mutations (S253A and S315A) into the FOXO3 locus, generating engineered human embryonic stem cells that, upon mesenchymal differentiation, gave rise to progenitor cells with enhanced stress resilience and self-renewal capacity‚Äîdesignated as senescence-resistant cells (SRCs). These cells exhibited enhanced proliferative potential, reduced secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors, and increased heterochromatin stability, all without evidence of transformation or tumorigenicity.

Administering SRCs intravenously to aged cynomolgus monkeys over a 44-week period led to a cascade of restorative changes. Compared to wild-type mesenchymal cells, SRCs more effectively reversed age-related changes across the brain, immune system, bone, skin, and reproductive tissues. Multi-modal assessments‚Äîbehavioral, histological, transcriptomic, and methylomic‚Äîconsistently indicated biological age reversal.

Notably, SRC-treated monkeys exhibited improved cognitive function, restored cortical architecture, and enhanced hippocampal connectivity. Bone density increased, periodontal degeneration was mitigated, and immune cell transcriptional profiles shifted toward a youthful state. At the molecular level, transcriptomic aging clocks showed an average reversal of 3.34 years with SRCs, while DNA methylation clocks corroborated these effects in multiple tissues. Furthermore, the authors observed the restoration of reproductive system health. In both male and female monkeys, SRC treatment reduced senescent markers, enhanced germ cell preservation, and reversed transcriptional aging clock across ovaries and testes. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that oocytes, granulosa cells, and testicular germ cells responded particularly well, rejuvenating by up to 5‚Äì6 years. These findings offer new insights into addressing reproductive aging and fertility decline.",2025-08-05 01:52:51,https://academic.oup.com/lifemedi/article/4/4/lnaf022/8169049?login=false

1g5ooqp,Switzerland,advice for buying fondue pot conquelon,"I have always borrowed a fondue pot from neighbors but now its time to buy my own.  I have seen many fondue sets in the Brockenhaus, and they look perfectly fine.

Does anyone have advice on what to look for in a second-hand fodue pot?  I am not Swiss, and am rather clueless.  We will use it only for cheese fondue, family of 4.

1lklxig,nutrition,Eating food from publicly traded large companies,"Just asked an AI why most food in my pantry (USA) contains high-fructose corn syrup and wow, this is what I got:

""Larger, long-established companies tend to use more processed, non-organic ingredients and chemicals compared to smaller, independent companies‚Äîthat can be attributed to a combination of economic, operational, and market-driven factors. 

#Economies of Scale and Cost Pressures
Large companies often prioritize cost efficiency to maintain profitability as they scale. Using processed ingredients, synthetic preservatives, and cheaper non-organic materials reduces production costs, enabling them to offer competitive prices and maintain high profit margins. Smaller companies, with less pressure to compete on price, can focus on quality and niche markets, often prioritizing organic or natural ingredients to differentiate themselves.

#Public Companies and Shareholder Pressure
When companies go public, they face intense pressure from shareholders to maximize profits and show consistent growth on the stock market. This can lead to cost-cutting measures, such as replacing high-quality, organic ingredients with cheaper, processed alternatives or adding shelf-stabilizing chemicals to extend product life. These changes boost margins but often compromise ingredient quality. Independent companies, typically privately owned, are less beholden to such external financial pressures and can prioritize product integrity over short-term gains.

# Supply Chain and Scale Challenges
Large companies require massive, consistent supplies of ingredients to meet demand, which can be difficult to source organically due to limited availability and higher costs. Processed or non-organic ingredients are often more readily available, cheaper, and have longer shelf lives, making them attractive for large-scale production. Small companies, with smaller production runs, can more easily source local or organic ingredients without the same logistical constraints.

# Market Positioning and Consumer Expectations
Big companies often cater to a broad, price-sensitive consumer base, leading them to formulate products that prioritize affordability, consistency, and shelf life over quality. Additives like artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives enhance taste, appearance, and longevity, aligning with mainstream consumer expectations. 

Early in their lifecycle, companies may focus on quality to establish their brand. As they grow and mature, the focus often shifts to optimizing processes and reducing costs to stay competitive. This can lead to reformulations that favor processed ingredients. Smaller, newer companies are often still in the ""innovation"" phase, emphasizing quality to carve out a market niche.

A study from the Journal of Food Science noted that large-scale food production often relies on additives to maintain consistency across batches, especially for products distributed globally.
Posts online frequently highlight consumer frustration with big brands reformulating products with cheaper ingredients, like replacing sugar with high-fructose corn syrup or natural flavors with artificial ones.
Small, independent brands often market themselves as ""clean label"" or organic, with certifications like USDA Organic or Non-GMO Project Verified, which resonate with consumers seeking transparency.

# Why Small Companies Offer Better Ingredients
Small, independent companies often operate with shorter, more transparent supply chains, allowing them to source higher-quality ingredients. Cater to niche markets that value organic, non-GMO, or minimally processed foods.
Avoid the same financial pressures as publicly traded companies, giving them flexibility to prioritize quality over cost.

1hptdqw,nutrition,"Dietary diversity, longevity and meat?","This year and the last few years there has been some research shopping that there is correlation between how diverse one's diet is and longevity. This is similar to but not identical to the advice from the results from Human Gut Project in 2018, which promoted consuming at least 30 different vegetables, fruits, grains, seeds and spices per week. 

The difference, from what I understand, is that these studies also includes consumption of fish, meat, poultry, diary and eggs. 

I have 2 questions regarding this:

1. Does the results from these studies on dietary diversity and longevity imply or point towards the possibility that a highly diverse and high quality (HDHQ)\* omnivore diet could be more correlated with longevity then a HDHQ pescetarian diet, and a HDHQ pescetarian diet could be more correlated with a HDHQ vegetarian diet? My way of thinking is that a pescetarian diet opens up the possibility of more diversity compared toa vegetarian and likrwise with an omnivorous diet compared to the other two. 

\* With ""highly diverse"" I here mean 30 or more plants, fruits, seeds, legumes or spices as recommended n the HGP 2018. With an ""omnivorous diet"" I here mean one which would keep red meat at a minimum due to the negative health effects of a high consumption of red meat)

2. The studies I have read does not seem to be sure on the reason for the correlation between longevity and a high diversity in nutrition, besides that it leads to a high amount of antioxidants which could fight of long term inflammation.  My own spontaneous thought is that the reason for the correlation could be that the more diverse a diet is the more it increases the chances of regularly consuming most of the 41 nutrients that Bruce Ames' connects with longevity in his triage theory. 

Is this a sound conclusion or not? If no, do you have another better conclusion?

I have done a lot of deep dives trying to find arguments and evidence to refute this and haven't found anything compelling that supplies as much scientific evidence and studies as he does. 

If I had any doubts, books like The China Study, Blue Zones, and docs like Game Changers and Live to 100 really solidified this argument for me.

And yet, the general population seems clueless to this viewpoint, with nutritionists still recommending eggs, yogurt, and meat, etc.

However, some other experts tend to find that a better route for healthy aging is focusing on a plant based approach, the amount of protein being secondary to getting enough  calories of whole foods (dr. Gregger comes to mind, but there are plenty).

This personal project, born out of my routine, allows me to gather and analyze various health data, making it a potential resource for others seeking a similar approach.

**The Dynamic Spreadsheet**

The spreadsheet comprises two main sections: Health Tests and Supplements. Under Health Tests, I've incorporated insights from sources like Peter Attia's book on longevity and a comprehensive health test available in the UK, known as the Everyman test. This section allows users to input their test results, compare them against optimal ranges, and assess areas that may require improvement. It's a dynamic tool, adaptable to individual preferences and tests.

**Exploring Supplements**

Moving on to Supplements, I've curated information on vitamins, minerals, herbs, and functional stacks. Each entry provides details on the supplement, its functions, optimal ranges, and even links to purchase them. Additionally, I plan to create videos elaborating on each supplement, transforming the spreadsheet into an extensive video library for easy reference.

**Accessibility with Airtable**

Airtable, the platform hosting this spreadsheet, is free to use. I've designed this resource with accessibility in mind, ensuring it remains entirely free for users. If you find this tool valuable, supporting the channel can be as simple as following the provided links for supplement purchases‚Äîa gesture that goes a long way in sustaining this effort.

**Evolving Insights**

As a work in progress, the spreadsheet will continually evolve, offering more detailed insights and additional features.

1azpch2,nutrition,Protein is killing you?,"I'm currently reading ""How Not to Age,"" by Michael Greger. He emphatically recommends lowering, or ideally entirely cutting out animal protein, and reducing overall protein intake to around the RDI. He cites a convincing amount of literature suggesting that the constant stream of IGF-1 resulting from high protein diets (even from vegetarian sources) torpedos longevity and dramatically increases risk of cancer and heart disease.

Contrast that with other researchers (like that of Peter Attia for instance) who argue that a protein intake of 2-3x the RDI is critical for building and maintaining muscle, especially as we age. He recommends *increasing* protein intake, especially as one gets older, since frailty is as great a risk as any other morbidity.

 **Concluding quote(s) from:** 
 
 The evidence from the literature to date underscores the need for hypothesis-driven and multi-disciplinary assessment of nutrition and healthspan to identify the complex dietary patterns that promote healthy longevity. Alone, an ‚Äúepidemiological‚Äù comparison of how a low versus a high consumption of an isolated macronutrient and its association with health and mortality may not only fail to identify protective or detrimental nutrition patterns but may lead to misleading interpretations. For example, many epidemiological studies have pointed to the increased mortality risk in subjects with low IGF-1, leading to the conclusion that IGF-1 should be maintained higher, but several studies have pointed to both the lowest and highest IGF-1 levels being associated with higher mortality, pointing to mid-range IGF-1 as consistently linked to low mortality (Burgers et al., 2011). Thus, epidemiology, which is clearly a central pillar in determining the ideal ranges of a nutrient or factor for health and longevity, should be complemented by at least three additional pillars that account for age, sex, and underlying metabolic status and that assess risk factors in addition to biological age: (1) basic research focused on lifespan and healthspan, (2) carefully controlled clinical trials, and (3) studies of individuals and populations with record longevity.

The longevity diet

Based on all of the studies discussed in this review and representing all the pillars of longevity listed above, we can begin to point to a common denominator for healthy longevity. These pillars indicate that the everyday normocaloric longevity diet associated with low or very low side effects and extended lifespan and healthspan is characterized by a mid to high carbohydrate and low but sufficient protein intake that is mostly plant based but includes regular consumption of pesco-vegetarian-derived proteins (Longo, 2018). For example, animal products represented about 1% of the traditional diet of the record longevity Okinawans (Willcox et al., 2007), and occasional meat or animal-product consumption also characterized the populations of the Sardinian and Loma Linda areas with high prevalence of centenarians or high average lifespan (Levine et al., 2014). The benefits of such a diet are supported by evidence from the calorie and protein restriction studies in short-lived species, are in agreement with the epidemiological data described in earlier sections, and are consistent with the evidence from large clinical trials. Thus, the low but sufficient protein diet or a normal protein intake with high legume consumption and therefore relatively low content of methionine and other amino acids contributes to the reduction in the levels/activity of the pro-aging GHR, IGF-1, insulin, and TOR-S6K signaling (Figure 2). However, in over 65 individuals the low-protein diet does not appear to reduce further the circulating IGF-1 already lowered during the aging process and may instead contribute to lean body mass loss and frailty. In the absence of obesity and insulin resistance, the relatively high complex carbohydrate consumption may also contribute to avoiding frailty at all ages but particularly in the elderly, thus providing energy without increasing insulin and activating glucose signaling pathways.

A fat consumption providing about 30% of energy mostly from plant-based and pro-longevity sources is also part of the longevity diet and is again consistent with the basic research, and epidemiological and clinical data, although the traditional Okinawan diet provided a much lower level of fats, confirming that there are variations of the optimal longevity diet that could be equally effective. The high circulating fat content does not appear to have the pro-aging effects of the protein- and sugar-endocrine axes, possibly because fat catabolism, fatty acids, and ketone bodies are at the center of fasting responses. A recent study based on meta-analyses and data form the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study including studies from the United States, China, and Europe provides evidence in support of the longevity diet. A sustained change from the typical Western diet to an optimal diet rich in legumes, whole grains, and nuts with reduced red and processed meats is associated with an increase in life expectancy of 10.7 years in females and 13 years in males if started at age 20, and over 8 years of increased life expectancy when started at age 60 (Fadnes et al., 2022).

An important caveat is that the longevity diet should be designed to avoid malnourishment, particularly in the over-65 population, to prevent frailty and diseases that may result from reduced bone or muscle mass or low blood cell counts. Ideally, the longevity diet would also include a 12‚Äì13 h daily fasting period that has been shown to be safe, feasible, and effective in many studies. The periodic use of a FMD in those age 18 to 70 may be key in reversing the insulin resistance generated by a high-calorie diet. In fact, maintaining a BMI lower than 25 and an ideal sex- and age-specific body fat and lean body mass levels and distribution and abdominal circumference should be used as guidelines to establish daily food intake rather than a set calorie level. FMD cycles can also lower IGF-1, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and inflammation, particularly in at risk subjects.
In summary, we propose that the longevity diet would be a valuable complement to standard healthcare and that, taken as a preventative measure, it could aid in avoiding morbidity, sustaining health into advanced age.",2022-05-08 12:21:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/ul0jva/research_discussion_nutrition_longevity_and/
te1gkw,nutrition,Any anecdotal stories of Ikaria's REAL traditional diet?,"TL;DR:
Anyone who's been to Ikaria, Greece, and spent time with the locals and older generations - what foods genuinely make up their seasonal day-to-day diets?

The online narrative seems rather conflicted, so getting your insight (from those who have actually been there and seen what the elders eat) could be incredibly helpful. Thanks all. üòÅ 

FULL QUESTION BACKGROUND:
Okay, the place is considered a longevity hotspot named a 'Blue Zone', and ""plant-based eating"" has been promoted by the mainstream agenda as a reason why.

However, I have also heard and read of people's personal experiences and backgrounds that indeed, Ikarians treasure their sheep / goat dairy, red meat, offal, and enjoy a considerably less plant-based diet (as a proportion) than what is suggested.

This sort of conflicting anecdote VS mainstream narrative extends into other areas such as Nicoya and Okinawa, too.

Also, Dan Beuttner's (the man who coined the term 'Blue Zone''s) work has also been thoroughly scrutinised by some, such as due to presumed nitpicking of data and a biased view against animal foods...

On that point, I wonder if longevity expert David Sinclair is mistaken on his perspective of what these areas truly eat? The leafy greens etc., he seems to be right on, but I'm not sure if he overlooks the actual level of animal products healthy centenarians might be eating / have eaten. ü§î",2022-03-14 16:29:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/te1gkw/any_anecdotal_stories_of_ikarias_real_traditional/
qcxxiv,nutrition,Seed Oils - What does the science really say?,"So I've seen a vocal minority on this sub with quite a bone to pick with seed oils. I feel many newer proponents may have come after a certain big youtuber made a video on them, but the idea has been around for a while. I want to set the record straight. Or, at the minimum, have a post I can link back to for when this topic pops up again. 

There are *many* studies on seed (and similar vegetable) oils so I don't want to shotgun a million of them in an exhaustive list. I'll do my best to stick to meta-analyses, systematic reviews and one massive cohort.

First is a prospective analysis of over half a million retired people. Each lipid source is estimated separately, dosage estimated via questionnaire using frequency and serving size, they found:

> [Consumption of butter and margarine was associated with higher total and cardiometabolic mortality. Replacing butter and margarine with canola oil, corn oil, or olive oil was related to lower total and cardiometabolic mortality. Our findings support shifting the intake from solid fats to non-hydrogenated vegetable oils for cardiometabolic health and longevity.](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-021-01961-2)

Not an outright healthy or unhealthy finding as finding a control with no oils, butter or margarine whatsoever is likely very difficult. But as compared to butter and margarine, seed oils come out on top.


To precede anyone warming up their fingers to tell me epidemiology is bogus, questionnaires suck and correlation doesn't equal causation, I'll follow up with a meta-analysis of RCTs that support the findings. But I will point out that researchers are aware that correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, so they go to great lengths to carry out multivariate analyses to account for confounding variables. It's not perfect, but this is the world of nutrition science. Anyway:

> [Despite limitations in these data, our NMA findings are in line with existing evidence on the metabolic effects of fat and support current recommendations to replace high saturated-fat food with unsaturated oils.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002222752033546X)

Top quality stuff here. However I have seen this meta-analysis criticized because it only measured risk factors and didn't actually wait for enough people to die of heart attacks. To which I say, tough t*tties, we know full well these are risk factors and the scientific consensus on them is very clear.

One last one. The main proposed idea behind seed oils being so bad for you is that they have highly inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, typically in the form of linoleic acid (LA). But, unfortunately, the science shows otherwise. Following is a systematic review of RCTs on inflammatory markers of LA (but we can do the other fatty acids too), with many of the studies on the oils themselves as a proxy, that finds:

> [We conclude that virtually no evidence is available from randomized, controlled intervention studies among healthy, noninfant human beings to show that addition of LA to the diet increases the concentration of inflammatory markers.](https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672\(12\)00464-9/fulltext) [...] the outcome of this review should provide the dietetic community and other health professionals with a measure of reassurance regarding current dietary recommendations that
emphasize optimal intake of both n-6 and n-3 PUFAs (from
sources such as soybean, canola, corn and safflower oils)

EDIT: Please engage with citations! We're all aware of the potential flaws in the above papers, but if you have nothing better, then the best you can hope for is a draw. That is to say, if the science showing seed oils have positive effects is thrown out, so the (scant) reasoning they should be negative must be too. Hence the conclusion must be they are neutral at most. And neutral =/= bad, so this tactic isn't so great for those of you who believe they are so unhealthy.",2021-10-21 18:17:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/qcxxiv/seed_oils_what_does_the_science_really_say/

11zqskk,Smoothies,Nutribullet Blender Combo... return or hold out?,"Hi all! My husband and I blend up protein smoothies (powder, frozen fruit, oat milk) 5x a week. Aside from that. our blender gets some use with pasta sauces and the occasional milk shake. 

Previously, we would switch between using an old full-size Hamilton Beach blender and an off-brand personal blender we got as an insurance freebie. They had both been needing replacing for a while, and finally the small one's attachment broke and I needed a solution fast, so I decided to go for the Nutribullet Blender Combo. Got a good deal on it at Kohl's and paid about $90 out the door. 

However, I'm possibly having a bit of buyers remorse because, while this morning's first smoothie came out SMOOTHER than EVER (way less seedy!), I'm a bit shocked that the brand recommends replacing blades every 6 months?? I checked the comparable Ninja models' manuals online and they didn't recommend the same. Plus, the Blender Pitcher has a built in blade, so does that mean I'll be replacing the pitcher 2x a year? I was really hoping going for a more elevated brand meant more longevity but I'm considering a return if this is going to be a recurring expense. Would love any insight to how your  blenders have held up, if you're truly replacing parts often, etc. Especially with average (but daily) use like we do... 

This was a bit of an unplanned purchase due to our old personal blender pooping out, so anything $150+ (ie Vitamix) was a bit out of range for us, but it was rated highly all over the internet so I'm curious about long-term use.

Thank you!",2023-03-23 17:12:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smoothies/comments/11zqskk/nutribullet_blender_combo_return_or_hold_out/
gqn1fy,Smoothies,Smoothie Review Please! Includes a smoothie recipe I love!,"Hey everyone, just wanted some opinions on a smoothie I make everyday.

&#x200B;

It includes:

\- Unsweetened Almond Milk

\- 2 cups of baby spinach

\- vanilla vegan protein powder

\- 1 frozen banana 

\- couple ice cubes

\- 3/4 cup blueberries 

\- flax seed, hemp seed and chia seeds

\- Spirulina

It tastes delicious like this.

&#x200B;

However, today I added ginger root I just cut some off the end and threw it in with the skin on it. Also I put in some red organic Kale. My smoothie from before now doesn't taste as good as it did. Its a bit more chunky and the ginger is really powerful. Had to add a second banana. 

1.) How much ginger do I need in there?

2.) Am I okay to leave the skin on the ginger?

3.) Anything else I should include in the smoothie, I workout once a day and my job requires a lot of energy and mental clarity. Longevity is very important to me. 

( - Taste is important mainly just to make me coming back to it everyday without hesitation. )

The Vitamix E310 is currently on top of my list, but I wanted to know what the group thinks of this one. 

If you have any other suggestions, feel free to let me know. Since, I use it on a regular basis, longevity is a big factor and then ofcourse the price.

12ma62o,HealthyFood,Carbs before sports,"I like to load up on energy before playing hockey. Of course a lot of professional hockey players eat rice and chicken (nice, but also kinda boring). I like rice but pasta is often faster, and I prefer potatoes to both to be honest. My question is; which carbs are best before sports? Obviously I don't want a ball of food in my stomach while playing, and I've found potatoes seem to the the worst for this. Is there much difference in how long each group lasts? How fast/easily the body consumes them? Is one better for longevity? Is there time differences for how long before sports I should consume each? Any other insights would be welcome!!

pu4hqx,HealthyFood,"Why isn't there a widely known ""optimal"" diet plan?","When coming up with a workout plan, we usually design them so that specific muscles are grouped together and are targeted on separate days, giving them enough time to recover, maximizing their time under tension, which ideally resulting in efficient use of your time at the gym. Why don't we do the same thing with our diets? Like can't we just gather every nutrient macro/macro nutrient requirement that every typical human body need, find the  right foods, and then design a diet plan of specific meals that fulfill those requirements? I don't just mean a food pyramid, I mean something that gives you a specific meal for breakfast, lunch and dinner that you can rotate through so you get enough variety (e.g. day 1 - egg + toast, kale salad + chicken, roasted broccoli + salmon, day 2 - etc.). 


There are some obvious hurdles due to variation in humans, but are those variations so large that they can't be accounted for with simple adjustments? With working out, if you want to focus on your biceps, you can add more curls to you plan. If doing a certain lift gives you pain, you can usually replace it with an alternative. Can't we treat diets the same way and if not, what are the variables that complicate things? Doing some of my own research, I found what is called the ""[1975 Diet](https://www.nippon.com/en/in-depth/d00482/the-1975-diet-and-the-secret-of-japanese-longevity.html)"" which was apparently an attempt to basically do this in Japan to increase longevity.

irpicj,HealthyFood,Lemon water in the morning - must I use real lemons?,"Belief: that drinking water with lemon first thing in the morning is good for us.

Question: Would replacing real lemons with bottled lemon juice be an equally suitable alternative for the reason of health?

Reasoning: If this is true and the health benefits are still there, then bottled lemon juice is a clear winner for me. It doesn't bruise, takes up less space, has far greater longevity, is far cheaper, and is less likely to go in my eyes (after cutting said lemons).

So what does everyone think?

2v0sr9,HealthyFood,"Sustainability as part of the definition of ""healthy""","Sustainability and Nutrition in most people's minds are two differnt pursuits with competiting priorities, researched by two sets of experts, with two sets of advocates and enthusiasts, but I don't think their true meaning is completely separate. A healthy ecosystem means a healthy food supply means a healthy you. 

Viewing food as health commodities without regard for the health of their source puts us at risk of stressing the system from which that food came. Tipping the scales with the demand for trendy ""health"" foods like quinoa, almonds, coconut oil, coconut water, all of which have had some controversial impact on the communities and/or environment from where they came,  is antithetical to the health and longevity of the system as a whole and I personally therefore do not consider them ""health"" foods. 

Beyond food fads, those who are interested in eating healthy should keep in the view the sources and production of ""everyday"" foods like, shrimp, beef, produce that has been imported halfway across the world. Greenhouse gas emissions from livestock,  from agriculture, from transportation, along with the environmental and social consequences of intensive seafood farming, are all wheels turning against ecosystems around the world, and most importantly, against the security of our food supply 

The new ""My Plate"" guidelines from the FDA, which have replaced the agen and obsolete Food Pyramid model of a healthy diet, encourages the incorporation of sustainability considerations into food choices. I think this is a step in the right direction and deserves more urgent, intensive and expansive dissemination. 

Would love to hear everybody weigh in on this.

First time posting here. I have very, very little free time for a variety of reasons (primarily the fact that both my wife and I work full time and we have three young children -- 2, 4, and 6).

Do you have any advice or recommend any resources for how to prioritize workouts starting from the least amount of time available and building up from there?

For example, what kind of workouts should I prioritize if I only have 30 minutes vs 60 minutes vs 90 minutes a week to exercise? What kind of workouts should I prioritize if I only have 5 minutes a day vs 10 minutes a day vs 15 minutes a day?

I want to have a baseline that I commit to and slowly build up from but keep that baseline as a fallback for when my schedule gets really hectic.

My goals are primarily weight loss, general fitness, and longevity. I'm 37. I'd like to lose around 40 pounds.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

_________Example of What's in the Notes_________

**Quick Intro:**

These are 6 months worth of reading books, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and trying new methods of training all in my pursuit to be more fit.  That said, I've decided to share notes I've taken on the three coaches I consider to be the top teachers and doers of the strength, conditioning, and nutrition industry, whose pedigree spread across the experienced  trenches of Olympians, US Special Operations, World Strongest Man, UFC, NFL, etc --just to name a few. Now, they are by no means the holders of the gospel of fitness, nor are they the only voices worth listening to, but here's why I chose who I chose:

**Philosophy of Choice:**

* Achievements in personal fitness - need to be fit, and have fitness results in their own life. Can't be all head knowledge or studies. No book worms or science nerds without the in-the-trenches experience.
* Achievements in client fitness - need to have produced results in others lives, because knowing what works for you is vastly different than being able to identify, correct, and advance what works for others.
* Renown and respected by the community - peers need to recognize contributions to the community
* Longevity - How long have they been in the game? How long have they stayed healthy? How long have they been training clients? All important questions in establishing reputation.


**Why I Chose Stan Efferding:**

> To me, Stan is the summation of an average guy with absolute discipline who's taken the best advice from the best gurushe's personally trained with from around the world for decades, and becoming himself an absolute beast. I chose Stan because of his humble demeanor, and because he's also one of the strongest bodybuilders in the world. Additionally, he has trained the Mountain to win his first Arnolds Strongest Man 2018 this past March.

>* Blue collar guy who presents some info. No tips or tricks. Turned over every rock looking for the secret. Spent loads of money, and there is only one answer: sleep, eat, and train.
* Matt Wenning calls him ""the strongest bodybuilder on planet earth.""
* Helped get Hapthorr ""The Mountain"" diet in check, where he set records in elephant bar (1000lbs+) and bag-over-bar, and take first as Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coached various bikini competitors, NBA, NFL, MLB, UFC, etc
* Worked with Brian Shaw's diet and helped him achieve second place at Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coaching Larry Wheels (aesthetic and powerful beast) and Dan Green. 
* Has trained with almost every guru in the business, directly or indirectly.
* Former bodybuilding and powerlifting competitor. 
* Squats in the 800lbs+ at 50+ years of age.


**Why I Chose Charles Poliquin:**

> One of the first world renown and truly experienced strength coaches of the modern era. ""Research catches up to Charles,"" has been said about his bleeding edge yet common sense approach to training. While considered by a few to be the king of psuedo-science, the ironic part of this claim is that from all my note-taking from the past 6 months --from books on Green Berets to interviews with the Mountain to 3-hour long seminars with various teachers-- Charles cites his sources and explains the history of what he's talking about more often than any other individual or source I've been reading, watching, or listening.

> * One of the best and most distinguished strength coaches in the world.
* Trained various Special Operations (Seal Team 6, SAS included)
* Coached the US womens team to win their first Olympic gold in history, and defeated Japan in their 20 year reign.
* 38+ years of Olympian training across 23 different sports, went to 3 different Olympics as a coach. Also have trained various high-level professional athletes and coaches in the military, Crossfit, NFL, NHL, MLB, etc.
* Researches studies from as far back as 1890's
* Ability to recall information, facts, research papers, all to the date, location of study, and to the author/researcher, a skill second to no other fitness expert (reminds me of the level of expert recall Robert McNaramara displays in the documentary ""Fog of War"").
* Lectures around the world with book authors like Jay Papasanas, Ed Coan, and world renown athletes like Dmitry Klokov.
* Always ahead of the curve (attributed as first in the US to recommend BCAAs, fish oils, German Volume training,  tempo training, cluster training, neuro transmitter profile training, etc).
* Stan Efferding, Matt Wenning, and Mark Bell have all implemented information from Charles into their personal training, and how they train clients, and all speak highly of him.
* Has huge biceps and abs for an old man.

**Why I Chose Matt Wenning:**

> I chose Matt because of his personal and professional achievements. Hired to train various Special Operations for the military and is the first to be implemented at a large scale. His methods have reduced injury rates across the board for fire, police, and military (and thus saved money for those organizations), and is a master of training and preventing overtraining.

> * Multiple records in the squat alone, including a 1196lb squat.
* Broke 4 world records; second highest RAW at 208 class with 2204lb total.
* Works with thousands of US military, including various Ranger regiments, 4th Infantry, and paratroopers out of Bragg. 
* Developed Mountain Warrior Athlete program out of Ft. Carson.
* Clients include NFL, US Special Operations, law enforcement, fireman, professional athletes, universities, elderly (difficult to train and yield safe results) and kids with disabilities
* His training with first responders and military has reduced site budgets significantly, due to decreased injuries and insurance claims.
* Attended university in Indiana where NASA funded the strength and conditioning programs and recruited top-tier professors.
* Top ten in the world for almost two decades with no major injuries (rare in the strength industry)
* Masters degree in sports biomechanics under Dr. Kramer
* Trained closely and mentored by various powerlifting legends like Louie Simmons, Ed Coan from his teen years, and was one of the youngest to squat 900lbs

**Notes on Notetaking:**

> Each section of notes will include everything I felt was noteworthy, even if it's repeated 3 times in 3 other podcasts. I did this as people will cherry-pick which seminars they want notes on, and I don't want them to miss out on key information just because I wrote it down elsewhere. Also, rehearing the same things over and over again just works as positive reinforcement and mentally conditioning good habits. Can't hurt to hear solid advice over and over again.

> Additionally, these notes are taken as a stream-of-thought process and later revised and edited, so they may seem short, fluid, or lacking in information. I reread the notes a few times and tried to expand and clean up, but I will have missed some parts.

> **Compilation of Notes Regarding Training Women:** (work in progress)

> * For the female lifter: 10-minute walks better than 40 minute treadmill. Doesn't breakdown muscle, still helps with fat loss. 
* If on a limited calorie diet, then the caloric limit will yield results in body composition and performance based on the choice of foods, not just calorie choice. Choose nutrient rich foods like steak.
* 3oz of OJ or milk a couple times a day: liver and thyroid stimulus for metabolism. 
* Long cardio has high water demand. Sends wrong message to body: body holds on to fat to endure the longer workload. Also, body thinks heavy muscle is bad, gets rid of it.
* Stan noticed how joggers carry fat.  Body holds on to fat for fuel, gets rid of muscle. Body responds to stimulus you provide.
* Still need to develop cardio. Recommends HIIT under load: improves cardio while stimulating muscle. Weighted exercises with higher reps (why Matt and Stan recommend loaded exercise under distance). Performing 20 rep sets, or 30 second rest between weighted carries, running stairs (all concentric loading), pushing prowlers, 30s sprint/rest on recumbent bike (ten mins) are all great examples of cardio development.
* ""How do you talk people into losing weight by lifting weights?"" Cites his 60 year old women who lift weights and are lean. They don't have prior exercise experience, and they're stronger than most men.
* How much weight you have on you is 80% diet. Cardio isn't what gets bikini and stage competitors lean, it's they eat better. ""Don't want to be huge? Don't eat huge.""
* When you start training weights you start to retain water, so swelling occurs. Hypertrophy occurs, diet cleans up, everything will lean out.
* ""Foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue."" Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* Research: Sleep loss limits fat loss. Insulin resistance goes up; blood pressure goes up; hunger goes up; cortisol (breaks down muscle tissue; decreases testosterone, effects your thyroid; etc)
* Juicing and detox is completely worthless. All you can do is optimize how your body filtrates toxins, which is the liver. Best way to detox is to just not put the processed foods and oils into your body.
* 10 minute walks for athletes wanting to gain weight, with caloric gain. Also female competitors in bikini, but with calorie deficit. Helps digestion and insulin resistance. 
* Stan trained 40-50 minutes morning, 30 mins at night.
* Women tend to restrict and end of missing much needed fats and nutrients. Ability to absorb nutrients depends on using fats as a shuttle.
* ""*There's no black and white, there's only gray. Find out what fits you and do that*""
* States foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue. Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* If not yet deserving then stick to glutamine, amino acids, and whey. Losing body fat will make you more insulin sensitive.
* Steady-state cardio will cause you to get fatter. 
* Restricting fats causes fat. Fats help with insulin sensitivity.
* **Common mistakes with trainers and female clients:** not wanting to get strong. Not enough time on overload with women (don't have goals for strength). Short term goals to comply to regarding big lifts. Lean muscle tissue leads to insulin sensitivity.
* Believes most women in the gym are busy, not productive 
* Better glute development: split squats, squats, deadlifts (all of which develop horizontal and vertical jump). 



**TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:**

There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.

1. **Carbs:** Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. 
3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
5. **Warm-Up:** Static stretching isn't the best option prior to a lift, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. Here's the warm-up in practice with Mike O'Hearn, Stan, and Matt. 
6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption.",2022-07-26 16:10:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/w8nq4y/heres_70_pages_of_notes_ive_taken_from_20/
s8rgbl,Fitness,"RIP AND TEAR Program Review, and Discussion of Program Development.","**Introduction**: 

This week I am finishing the last week of my 12 week program, Rip And Tear. This post is going to take a look at the program, my run of it, and then cover some general thoughts about writing programs. 

I like to start every post I write with a brief overview of the sections included in the post so that readers can know what they are getting into and skip to what the want if they don‚Äôt have the attention span to read a few pages. 

*The Results*: This section is just a brief look at the results of the 12 weeks, mostly strength focused. 

*The Program*: This section will go over the program itself, with focuses on what it contains/ is designed to accomplish, who should run it, and some of my inspirations. It will also include a link to the spreadsheet for the program. 

*My Run*: This section will look at my experience running the program, what I liked about it, what I changed, and other aspects of my 12 week run. 

*How and Why to Write a Program*: The last section will look at what goes into writing a program. Why you should or should not do it, when you should consider it, and how to go about it. 

**The Results**:
Here are some of my results from the program, which is probably the part of most interest to many of you: 

Squat: [465 x 12]( https://youtu.be/0R6zViHMR0A), [500 x 10]( https://youtu.be/r1E3OkvdVTo),  [405 x 20](https://youtu.be/I7djdphzDK8), [525 x 10 Box]( https://youtu.be/0p_ZoMgI5VM), [655lb Box]( https://youtu.be/hI4P6J2Kb3I)

Bench Press: [365 x 4]( https://youtu.be/PYy_hxCpXLw), [415 x 1]( https://youtu.be/OpG-8_e6NTY)

Deadlift: [700 x 10]( https://youtu.be/TNfy-v5d92M), [800 x 3](https://youtu.be/WYshrJyg1oM). 

Other: [805lb Deadlift 360]( https://youtu.be/_PQjjCKAqjU), [2 x 405lb Deadlift]( https://youtu.be/5Mrn8aDsvKg), [330lb Double Steinborn Squat](https://youtu.be/uQ3RPE2nIec), [365lb Single Leg Deadlift]( https://youtu.be/0zijYggfP-4), [365lb Scott Lift]( https://youtu.be/PYejvw04VTE)

Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift sets are all (or at least almost all) on program. The other lifts are side things I was able to do over the course of the program. 

I bulked for the entire period of the program but do not have specific weight numbers to share as I no longer find tracking my weight to have a purpose. I went from ~265 to ~275, give or take on both sides. 

I do not have before and after pictures, I am at a point where I could count the pounds of muscle I can expect to gain in a year on one hand, so I do not look for difference on a bulk to cut basis. [Here are some pictures from October for reference]( https://imgur.com/a/8NhJXWa). I have a strong sense of what is or is not an effective hypertrophy workout and I judge my success in that area by how many good hypertrophy workouts I can get in. I understand this is both subjective and internal, but you will have to take my word for it when I said that I was able to maintain solid and effective hypertrophy work through the 12 weeks. 

**The Program**: 

Rip And Tear is a 12 week program focused around high frequency, moderate volume, high weight Squat, Bench and Deadlift. [Here is a link to the Spreadsheet]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C4yiw7uNw1LSPlvWMDNnIlHcVQhXMzV4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104236994809501726559&rtpof=true&sd=true). Please do not ask for access to the master copy. Just make a copy for your own use. 

*Features of the program*: 

This is a 4-7 day program. It includes 3 bench days, 3 squat days, and 2 deadlift days a week. It covers programming only for these three lifts. All accessory work and the bulk of the hypertrophy work is up to the user. If you are not comfortable handling this aspect of your training yet this program is not for you. This program will also feature work for the same body parts on back to back days. If you do not have the work capacity or will to do that then this program is not for you.

The program is divided into 3 blocks that are 4 weeks each. Intensity ramps through each block then resets at the beginning of the next block. The primary mechanism of raising intensity is by an increase in weight used. This is coupled with a lowering of reps and increase in sets in most cases. Weights will reach as high as 90% of 1RM for working sets, and will go no lower than 70%. The highest rep range programmed is 7 reps, the lowest is 1. This is a program where you will be working with heavy weight. Weights are based off of a true 1RM. Do not use a training max, do not use an old PR single, pick a weight that you could confidently perform a single for at the beginning of the program. 

Every week except for the first week of each block features an AMRAP (as many reps as possible) set for each of the three lifts during the week. These AMRAPs are not used to moderate progression, progression is locked to your initial 1RM entries. These AMRAPs should be used to push yourself without fear of inflating future week‚Äôs weights. At the same time they are ultimately optional, all that is required on the final AMRAP set is the minimum reps. You are encouraged to use your best judgement and regulate yourself as needed. Keyword *needed*, not *wanted*. The final AMRAP of each block is dealers choice on weight. This is a chance for you to push for specific PRs if you so desire. 

Only 4 days a week include programmed lifts. The remaining 3 are listed as rest or hypertrophy days. How these days are used is up to you. I recommend at least 1 of these days be used for upper body hypertrophy work. Ideally a second one be used for extra work on small, quickly recovering muscles (shoulders, calves, arms, etc). I would not recommend using all three for lifting, save at least one for full rest. 3 of the programmed days include suggestions for additional hypertrophy work. You can choose to skip these if wanted, or work a different area. Again I want to stress that all accessory and hypertrophy work is *up to you*. 

*Who/What this Program is for*:

This program is designed to give you a framework for your Squat Bench and Dead (SBD) while leaving you room to still develop yourself through accessory/hypertrophy work. The high frequency on the SBD lifts and heavier weights will improve your specific strength on heavy SBD. If this is something you want, then this program might be for you. If you don‚Äôt care about heavy SBD then I hope it goes without saying but this program might not be for you. You should have a strong competency in these three lifts before attempting this program. If your technique is inconsistent or if it puts some stress on the body in an inappropriate way the high number of sets will exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to injury. **This is not a beginner program, this is not an ‚Äòintermediate‚Äô program**. This is program for experienced and competent lifters with a good handle on SBD.  

This program is probably best suited for periods of weight gain. You could potentially run it while cutting with appropriate moderation of your additional work but it goes against [my philosophy on cutting]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qj1ntt/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cutting_phases_by/?ref=share&ref_source=link). I would not suggest running this program back to back. I run a program like this once a year, and will probably continue to do so for the immediate future. It is a good opportunity to improve your SBD technique, while still leaving enough room and energy for an effective bulk. But it‚Äôs a very specific kind of stimulus and if you only train in this manner you are leaving a lot on the table. 

If you want to use an appropriate substitute for any of the three lifts you can. A trap bar deadlift would be fine to swap with the barbell deadlifts. A floor press would be an appropriate swap for the bench press. A leg press would not be an appropriate substitute for the squats. Etc. This lets the program be customized for individual preferences and limitations. You do not need to lift strictly barbell SBD to powerlifting standards for this program to be effective, but again *use your best judgement on substitutions*. If you have to **ask** if something is a reasonable substitute it probably is not. 


*Where the program came from*: 

This program is most heavily inspired by Layne Norton‚Äôs PH3. I ran PH3 at the end of 2019 and 2020. I ran it as written in 2019. I ran it with [modifications]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tCi26oYp8GvT7bJuoTGDvbqy8mazemFxD02Nl4xaFRQ/edit?usp=sharing) in 2020. I wrote about my thoughts on PH3 [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/eiz8uf/program_review_ph3/). In short, I felt that it was not suitable as written for the majority of lifters. The only population I thought could effectively keep up the loads and progression were those with substantial muscle and strength, but limited experience with lower rep, high weight SBD. Basically a population that was physically equipped for big lifts but missing the specific technical skill, leading to deflated 1RMs. Granted, *this is exactly who Layne wrote the program for*, so I can‚Äôt blame him for that. But I really liked the spirit of the program and wanted to adapt it for myself and a wider population. My first set of changes brought it into line a bit, I was not nearly as beaten up at the end of that run as I was the first, but it still wasn‚Äôt quite there. It also did not click with my current philosophy on bulk programming. 

Instead of further tweaking I decided to just take the aspects that I wanted to preserve, high frequency SBD with big weights, and rebuild from the floor up. I kept the core of the program (the 3x4 week structure, the split, and the positioning of the AMRAPS) and dumped pretty much everything else. I changed the percentages, the reps and sets, and removed the AMRAP based progression scheme. I also drew inspiration from Greg Nuckols 28Free Program Builder, with the increased weight coupled with lower reps but higher sets, as I really enjoyed that set up. 

I should also credit whoever was the original author of the PH3 spreadsheet on LiftVault, as I used the bones of that spreadsheet for this one. 

I credit DOOM for the name of the program. 

**My Run**: 

*Accessory/Hypertrophy*: 
I ran 2 additional hypertrophy days, one Upper-body and one Arm day on Days 7 and 4 respectively, with Day 2 as a full rest day. I initially took days from John Meadows Gamma Bomb for hypertrophy but quickly just started performing them how I wanted, using the GB workouts as inspiration only. 

On programmed days my additional work would look something like this: 2-3 sets of 2-5 movements, usually super-setted or giant-setted. I performed some arm work on Day 1, Leg work on Day 4, and Upper body on Day 5. I performed a more intensive Leg day on day 6. I did not keep movements consistent week to week, I performed whatever I was feeling like each day. 

*Changes, Choices, and Modifications:*
-I started with 585/405/785 S/B/D 1RMs.

-I cut the programmed squats on Day 6 pretty quickly. They did not really mesh well with how I wanted to run the rest of my hypertrophy leg days and hypertrophy took the priority over a bit if extra technical practice. 

-I skipped the deads on Day 1 as needed. Sometimes my back was just too fatigued for my heavy forward lean low bar and deadlifts back to back. I do not really need the technical practice on deadlifts, and saw little value in forcing uncomfortable clunky reps. 

-I took AMRAP sets either to PR or attempted PR, or to the minimum. I reasoned that if I was not in good enough shape to push for my best I was better off controlling my fatigue so I could keep up my hypertrophy work. 

-At one point I tweaked a knee on failing an off program lift. I skipped one sessions worth of squat and dead, then used block squats to just above parallel for the remainder of the program. 

-After the 415lb bench PR I felt a small pinch between my pec and my shoulder at the bottom of heavier bench reps. I subbed in floor presses from this point onwards. 

(I want to note that both of these injuries were basically gone in ~2 weeks and had a total impact of making me use some variations. Stop being terrified of injuries folks. Shit happens when you are trying hard). 

-I did a *lot* of off program nonsense over the 12 weeks. This seems to have a pretty minimal negative impact on my training. 

*Additional Notes and Thoughts*: 
During this bulk I consumed ~6,000 calories a day. I cut out my 5k rows the first week due to a head cold and never reintroduced them. I walked 6 miles with my dog most days, with that being reduced 3 miles or 0 miles on very cold days as I realized that I was barely gaining weight regardless of all the food, so there was little reason to try and expend more energy. 

Days 1, 3 and 5 I lifted in my basement. Days 4, 6, and 7 I lifted at the gym. I lift from ~9-11am, some days taking less some days taking more. 

I felt that every day‚Äôs programmed weights were challenging, but doable. Even on a bad day I could complete my reps if I put my mind to it. On the original program, near the end there was stuff I just could not do. Even during the first week where I had some very stuffy sinuses and a very dry throat I managed, including the first squat PR listed above. 

I think that I did betray my bulk philosophy a bit. My goals should have been primarily on the hypertrophy work, making sure that I left energy for these sets every day. But there were many instances where I had the potential to set a squat or deadlift PR and taking that set took the edge of my subsequent work. All the nonsense work also probably did not help. But ultimately I *wanted* do these things and that is what matters. 

I was very happy with how well box squats and floor presses, two movements I had never done before, slotted in when I needed them. The longer I workout the more I find that no specific movement is really needed and that expanding your horizons to try new variants and movement patterns ultimately pays off into similar lifts. I used to throw myself against barbell squat, bench and deadlift, terrified of any back slide. I kept the same training style and focused on the same accessory movements. This culminated in my least productive training year plus, where my SBD total increased 15lbs, or maybe even 10lbs with an arbitrary chip of a squat PR. It sucked, I was not excited to lift, I was not progressing, I worried that I was just done getting better. Then I sucked it up and tried a totally different type of program. I was forced to make more changes to how I worked out by the pandemic. I started trying other variants and goofing around with nonsense lifts. I took breaks from focusing on barbell SBD and it massively paid off. Since that plateau I have added almost 200lbs to my total and am confident I have room to grow on all three of the lifts. I realize I have gone on a bit of a tangent here but I think it is a valuable perspective. No matter what your goals are, or what you think that they are right now, a wider scope of training style, movement selection and programming methodology will help you. It‚Äôs good for your original goals, lets you experience new things you didn‚Äôt know that you liked and helps with training longevity, both physically and mentally. [I expand on these ideas a bit here, to plug some more reading.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qj1ntt/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cutting_phases_by/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I don‚Äôt think anything needs to be changed before I run it next year, which I still plan to do. I am comfortable changing things as necessary, which means I can adapt to my needs in the moment anyways. Seeing as this program is directed to experienced lifters, I think that if you run it you can probably make changes within reason as well. Just take ownership, if you want to change something make sure you are confident about it. If you aren‚Äôt, you probably should not be modifying your programming. 

**How and Why to Write a Program**: 

This last section I want to cover some of my thoughts on writing your own programming. A lot of people *want* to do their own programming, but I do not think most of them *should*. If you are in the category of people who can successfully manage it, I‚Äôll give some general ideas on it. 
My first outing in writing my own programming was the plateau year I described above. I ran something I wrote for over a year and I ended up with jack shit to show for it.
 I had just finished almost three years of random bro split into nSuns 531 into nSuns CAP3, and I felt that I had outpaced both programs, but did not want to shift to something totally different. So I took a very loose understanding of 531BBB, and hit it with a hammer until it was a pile of scrap that covered 6 days a week. I did not know what I was doing, why I was doing it, and I had only every experienced one flavor of programming. Turns out that 531BBB is not meant to be a 6 day program. Doing 531 sets + 5x10 + accessories 6 times a week, doubling up on SBD and cutting out OHP is not a good programming decision. 
But I was not going to let that stop me, I was going to run that ship fully aground over the course of a year and wonder why I was not getting anywhere. I cannot stress enough that I did not know what I was doing and that I had zero business writing a program after only three years of training and in only one style. *Do not be like me*. This is not me telling you that I am special and can write programs and you are not so you can‚Äôt. This is me explaining my own personal failings in that endeavor so that you might understand why it might not be a good idea for you. 

So what has changed between then and now? Well now I have another 4ish years of experience with a variety of programs, including my failed program. I have a much firmer grasp of what does and does not work for me, and what my training philosophies are. I have much more nuanced ideas of what my goals are and how I can reach them. I am thinking in programming blocks, not in just in perpetual consistent training. I am much more experienced and have a much greater knowledge of how things work, and how they don‚Äôt work. The only thing that can give you the above is time under, over, around or otherwise in the vicinity the bar or other heavy object. I do not believe you can effectively ‚Äòstudy‚Äô these things from a theoretical perspective, particularly when it comes to you as an individual. 

What is the best way to accumulate this experience? Train with a large variety of someone else‚Äôs programs. Try to pick programs that are radically different, or at very least from different people in different disciplines. Even as I tell you this there are plenty of areas I have not looked into yet. Even if you want to be like me and run programs that generally gravitate around SBD, you should at least run a lot of different SBD based programs in order to broaden your perspectives on how to train these movements. No two experienced coaches are going to have the same outlook, and by experiencing their programming you gain the benefit of their unique approach to training. As you gather this firsthand experience, pay attention to what you like and don‚Äôt like. What works for you and what does not. These are the aspects you are going to want to take, or leave, in your future programming. 

So now you have run at least 10 different programs, you‚Äôve been at this for quite a few years and have a pretty solid grasp on how you operate, and *you have results to show for it*. Are you ready to write a program? Maybe. *Should you?* Well that is a totally different answer. Ask yourself these questions: 

*‚ÄùWhy are you writing a program‚Äù*: The answer probably should not be ‚ÄòBecause I just want to‚Äô. I can‚Äôt stop you if this is your only reason, but it‚Äôs not really a good one. There are people better at this than you, and they are offering up their programs. You will almost certainly be better off just picking one that aligns with your needs and using that. A better answer to this question is ‚ÄòBecause nothing I have found quite meets my current needs‚Äô. Now you are getting somewhere. Generic programs are just that, generic. This does not mean that they are bad, but it means that they are meeting relatively broad needs so as to apply to a wide audience. A custom program does not need to do this, it can focus on as narrow and obscure a goal as you want it to. It can be tailored to your needs and wants. Why did I write Rip and Tear? Because I wanted to run PH3 again, but PH3 was not really compatible with me. No other program that I knew of had the parts of PH3 that I wanted but with more compatibility. 

*‚ÄùCan you just modify an existing program‚Äù*: As a follow-up, if you have a unique need, can you fulfill it by just taking a program and making some minor changes? As far as I am concerned there is no shame in working off someone‚Äôs programming homework and changing it just enough that the teacher does not notice. This was my first step, as mentioned above. I tried modifying PH3 before writing Rip and Tear and still didn‚Äôt quite get it where I wanted it. 
*‚ÄùWhat is your program going to do, and how‚Äù*: Even if you have identified that no program can meet your needs, with or without modification, you still need to be able to explain to yourself how your proposed program will meet those needs. How are you going to structure your program so that it helps you reach your goals? What is is going to look like, in broad strokes, and why are those strokes going to lead towards your success? If you can‚Äôt explain why your program will work, it probably isn‚Äôt going to do so. In my case this was an easy question to answer. I wanted to lifted heavy SBD a lot. So all my program had to do was contain a lot of heavy SBD sets. If your goal is more specific or based on an actual result, you might have a harder time with this question.

*‚ÄùWhat are you basing your program on?‚Äù*: I don‚Äôt think that anyone should just sit down with a blank piece of paper and completely create a brand new program from scratch. The experience you are leveraging to write this program came from other programs. *Use those*. Take chunks of other programs shamelessly. Nothing is original, even if you do make up everything in your program it‚Äôs still going to end up copying parts of someone‚Äôs programming. Don‚Äôt make more work for yourself, work with the enormous body if existing programming. As I have also mentioned above I drew from both PH3 and 28Free when writing Rip and Tear. 

*‚ÄùWhat are you going to call your program‚Äù*: All the good programs have cool names based on cool shit like superheros, heavy metal, giant robots, or puns. If you are going to write a program you have to name it something suitably intense to properly represent how powerful it is. I named my program Rip And Tear [because it‚Äôs intense]( https://youtu.be/NgAm664NloA) [as shit]( https://youtu.be/zZMg9ryeWOw). 
If you have established that you can make a program, should make a program, and know what‚Äôs going into it, here are a few final thoughts:

-Everything does not need to have to have a precise reasoning. I just picked percentages because they looked reasonable. I picked 2.5% jumps because it seemed like a good number. Why did I up the jump to 5% for the 3rd week? I accidently typed it that way in week three and decided that it looked alright to me. This was all totally fine because the precise percentages don‚Äôt really matter that much. A little lower and I would probably just get higher AMRAPs and have more juice for accessories. A little  higher and it would be the opposite. Neither is a big deal. 

-Along similar lines you should have a good sense of what your program is going to do, and a reasonable sense of how it‚Äôs going to do that, but the precise mechanisms aren‚Äôt super relevant. You don‚Äôt need to stress over having a double undulating bilateral progression scheme or a reverse pyramid step back looping progression, or whatever the influencers pretending to be eggheads are talking about. Is the program moving generally forward in some manner? That‚Äôs probably good enough. You should know several progression schemes that you like from the experiences you gathered. Just pick one. Adding specific movements to your program? Just pick some, I promise the choice between a banded floor press versus a chained block press wont make or break your programming. Focus on the large scale, not the small scale. Your foundation matters, what color you paint the walls does not.  

-Don‚Äôt be afraid to audible. If you realize a third of the way in that something is not working change it. You aren‚Äôt going ‚Äòoff program‚Äô, you wrote the damn thing, you are *editing* it. If you have the experience necessary to write a program you have the experience necessary to make judgement calls to change things mid-program. Frankly the later requires less experience than the former.

bowasx,Fitness,How would strength training in a caloric deficit affect body composition long term?,"I've been reading into the longevity benefits of caloric restriction, about 20% below maintenance IIRC and how it's the number one way to increase lifespan and reduce risks of disease in several species and I've been playing around with the idea of starting to fast 2 days a week, but keep my calories the same and thus achieving a weekly caloric deficit. I'm skinny-ish right now after having lost about 100 lbs through intermittent and extended fasting, but I'd like to start working out both for the health benefits (such as stronger bones), but also the benefit of having a more aesthetically pleasing body.

&#x200B;

If I were to implement caloric restriction and start to strength train regularly, how would that affect my body composition?

af6itz,Fitness,Started training at a fairly well known powerlifting and bodybuilding gym in my country. I have a few questions about the routine they gave me.,"As of 2019 my company is subsidizing 1200 ‚Ç¨ (around 1400 $) for us to get gym memberships and spend on other health/lifestyle related stuff so one of the guys on my team and I joined a local gym in my city that is fairly well known in my country for producing some local talent in powerlifting and bodybuilding that compete on both the local and international scenes. However we are mostly just in it to get to be healthy and strong for longevity purposes.

The trainer at the gym set us up with the gym's beginner routine which is the following:

**Workout 1**:

* Squat 3x5
* Bench Press 3x5
* Seated Cable Row 3x5
* Weighted Pull-up 3x5
* Barbell Glute Bridge 3x5
* Romainian Deadlift 3x10
* Accessories: Face Pulls 4x15, Leg Curl 4x15

**Workout 2**:

* Deadlift 3x5
* Overhead Press 3x5
* Weighted Chin-up 3x5
* Barbell Row 3x5
* Incline Press with Dumbbells 3x5
* Barbell Lunge 3x10
* Accessories: Rear Delt Fly 4x15, Glute Ham Raise 4x10

We are supposed to workout 2-3 days per week switching off each time between workout 1 and 2. The rest period is supposed to be 2 minutes for the first two exercises on each list, 90 seconds for the others. We increase the weight by one unit (for machines) or 2.5kg total (for barbells) the next session if we complete the lift with the given weight. The accessories they gave us are personal to us, since we are both software engineers. We were told to make sure not to neglect our back, rear shoulders, and hamstrings since we spend a lot of time sitting.

When we aren't in the gym there is a plan for the cardio portion of the workout (which is optional but we are doing it) where we start off running 5km 2x per week, and over 3 months it ends up going up to 10km. It's extremely cold and snowy here so they gave us some running ice spikes to attach to our shoes so we don't slip on the ice.

We were also told to eat at least our bodyweight in protein (in grams). For example I weigh 85kg so I was told to eat at least 85g protein per day.

I have a few questions:

1. The workout routine they gave me is a lot different than the ones I see in the FAQ. Is this a problem? I mean there is no arms workouts or calves workouts at all, but from what I noticed the guys who had been doing the workout for a while actually had quite proportional arms/calves to their bodies and they looked pretty nice.

2. Is the amount of protein enough? Again, it is less than what I have seen posted here but I asked a few guys and the trainer and they said the high protein amounts in fitness magazines and blogs were all complete BS and to just eat a well balanced diet with the amount of protein listed and I should be good.

3. There is no ab workout in the routine but the dudes I see doing this exact routine (although for over a year) actually have visible abs. How is this possible? To be honest I haven't asked anyone about it yet but I was thinking of asking later today when I go to the gym. Maybe they do abs at home, I have no idea.

Edit:

Forgot to mention my statistics, if that helps for any of the questions:

* Sex/Gender: Male
* Age: 25
* Height: 198cm (6 ft 6 in)
* Weight 85kg (187 lbs)

ad8q3f,Fitness,Butt lift on heavy bench - how bad is it?,"I've been doing bench for quite some time now, really enjoying pushing myself. I do sets of increasing 10 reps and at the end of the session I do three sets of heavy 5, 3 and 1 reps at about 85-90%, 90-95% and 95-100% respectively depending on day form. On the heaviest weights and deeper into the sets I've come to raise my butt off the bench two or three inches. I recently managed 255lb with that breach in form. I bench two or three days a week.

I was warned that the butt lift was dangerous. What are the risks of lifting the butt off the bench at higher weights and what are your experiences with bench form? I can post a form check if asked for. 

edit: i do not compete in power lifting, and i do not intend to. Lift for strength, size and longevity.

abwgs5,Fitness,"Each New Year I post here for those of you taking up swimming for improvement, exercise or weight management. This year I am sharing swimming secrets of long time swimmers like myself that you never see written elsewhere and no-one explains","Hi all,

I am mod of /r/swimming and an experienced marathon swimmer (over thirty open water swims greater than 10k). 
I usually post some advice here each New Year to assist new and improvng swimmers, and people hoping to use swimming for exercise and weight management.
Swimming is a sport that when done consistently will allow you to pursue it for an entire lifetime and reward you for doing do.

/r/swimming is a great resource, especially if you use the search bar, as there is almost no question that hasn't been asked and gotten an answer previously.
[Here's last year advice](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/7n8xff/folks_each_new_year_i_like_to_give_some_advice_to/ here).

I've said previously that there are no tricks or secrets in learning to swim. But it‚Äôs not entirely accurate about other aspects of swimming. 
These are secrets in that experienced swimmers know them, but it can take a long time for others to learn. These are the nuggets of knowledge that get passed in changing rooms and on decks, and are part of what we might call swim culture.

This should help collect some of the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù knowledge that experienced swimmers gain over time and so many new and improving swimmers haven‚Äôt yet learned, especially if they are not part of a swim group.

**Lane Etiquette**

By far the most annoying thing for swimmers are people joining the lane who have no understanding of lane etiquette used around the world by experienced swimmers. Actually this often includes the lifeguards on duty many of whom (most in my experience)  don‚Äôt understand either. 

Below are four simple rules. Yes, I know as a beginner you think this is too much, but people don‚Äôt play golf with a hockey stick, so I don‚Äôt know why non-swimmers think swimming is different. [Here is a comprehensive explanation of lane swimming etiquette  if you are inclined](https://loneswimmer.com/2011/02/15/lane-swimming-etiquette/).
* Ask or let the swimmer already in the lane know you are joining.
* Don‚Äôt start swimming or turn in front of a faster swimmer.
* The fastest swimmer has the right of way.
* Stay aware of what everyone is doing to avoid collisions and frustration for all.

**Goggles**

Because every swimmer in the world has an opinion and will happily entertain long discussions about goggs.

* No anti-fog will last on goggles longer than a couple of months
* Spit into googles for a simple reasonably effective anti-fog. Never touch the inside of the goggles.
* Use a 2/3 water, 1/3 baby shampoo mix, swirl it around and rinse it out for a more effective anti-fog
* Most ‚Äúhigh visibility open water goggles‚Äù aren‚Äôt high visibility and are seriously over-priced. The google design offering the most visibility are clear Swedish goggles (aka Swedes). Which are also the cheapest.
* More expensive goggles does not in any way mean better. Blame triathletes for the escalation of costs. The best goggles I‚Äôve bought in years were ‚Ç¨4 in Lidl the summer before last.
* There is no such thing as a generic ‚Äúbest google‚Äù answer. Competitive swimmers/online swimmers most often respond Vanquishers  or Swedish Goggles. Vanquishers are not available in Europe anymore & Swedes (Which I wear myself in the pool and [I show you how to fit here](https://loneswimmer.com/2013/06/26/how-to-swedish-goggles-fit-and-review/)) aren‚Äôt a good idea for beginner swimmers. I also wrote [this article about understanding the different kinds of goggles](https://loneswimmer.com/2015/02/04/how-to-understand-and-choose-between-the-different-types-of-swimming-googles/) so you can choose based on your own requirements rather than other‚Äôs opinions, because I had never once seen anything like this by any of the goggle manufacturers, or anyone else.
* Silicon straps don‚Äôt last long. Bungee straps are a great replacement.
* Two thirds of my swimming time is spent with my face underwater exhaling. I can see everything including guys jerking off, teenagers and older couples fiddling with each other and numerous erections.

**Technique (Front crawl)**

The name of the stroke is front crawl. Freestyle means that in competition you can swim any stroke, and since crawl is the fastest, it (mostly) gets used, so a lot of swimmers think crawl is freestyle and visa versa. Someone will probably even say in the comments here that no-one calls it front crawl. Front crawl is extensively used outside the US and is the accurate term.

BLABT  is the acronym for the process most swim experienced teachers use to evaluate stroke and teach front crawl. It stands for:

* **B**ody position
* Get horizontal in the water. Not being horizontal is the most common reason for swimming slow.
* Push your chest forward and down into the water. Try to swim downhill!
* Keep your head low and steady, don‚Äôt allow it to swing to the side. Imagine you are an a rotisserie spit that enters through your forehead, your whole body rotates around the centre point. If you raise your head, it‚Äôll cause the rest of your body to sink.
* Clench your butt cheeks. (Core muscles are used for position and rotation, doing this helps engage them).

* **L**egs
* In an elite swimmer, the maximum propulsion that comes from kicking is only 15% of overall speed. But to do that requires the body‚Äôs largest muscles and disproportionate amount of energy. (Long distance swimmers like myself do very little or no kicking).
* Fixing the kick is important for beginners so the legs don‚Äôt slow you down or cause you to sink. Kicking wildly (especially common in runners or triathletes) is more likely to cause you to slow. This is also part of the horizontal body position above. From what I have seen most triathlete swim coaches get this completely wrong and spend far too much time focusing on a better kick.
* You are not riding a bicycle. Kick from the hips, with only a little movement in the knees. New swimmers often have a big wide kick or their legs sinks, or both. This slows them down.
* While reading this, see if you can point your toes like a ballet dancer. If you can‚Äôt, start stretching your ankle while watching TV or while sitting at a desk. Not being able to point your toes while swimming is like pulling a weight behind you.
* Try swimming with your toes clenched into a fist. [Yes, just like Die Hard](http://die%20hard%20make%20toes%20into%20fists/). This will stop you kicking from the knees. You won‚Äôt be able to do it all the time, but it will help you understand what your position and kick should feel like.

* **A**rms
* Reach forward. Further still.
* Pull back underwater. But only when your palm is facing backwards behind you, not when they are facing the bottom. This called the Catch, when your hand starts effectively pulling.
* Keep pulling, then pushing backwards until your thumb scrapes your thigh.
* Try to always keep your elbow above your hand, at every point in the stroke. * This is not easy, and take a long time to get right.

* **B**reathing
* Exhale underwater
* Hum a little to get used to controlling your breath and exhalation
* Try sinking to the bottom of the pool with no arm or leg movement. This will help you learn breath control. Only do this when there is a lifeguard present.
* Rotate your head out of the water, don‚Äôt lift it. Don‚Äôt look forward or around. There is no forward visibility as part of standard front crawl, and learning this is a separate activity.

* **T**iming
* Both arms and legs alternate and all actions are smooth and continuous.
* Breathing is to the side.
* Rotate your hips to drive your arms to reach forward.

**Swimwear**

* Buy your swim suits one size smaller than the size you think you should wear based on your street clothes because water causes fabric to expand. You can‚Äôt see it but others can.
* Wear your swimsuit in the shower after your pool swim, it‚Äôs easiest way to wash out the chlorinated water. Suits will last up to four times longer. * Polyester suits lasts longer than chlorine tolerant fabric, and feels largely the same.
* Swimsuits are currently in a ‚Äúshrinking phase‚Äù, that is, getting smaller. Male briefs are becoming more thong like with very narrow side panels, female racing suits are getting cut much higher at the rear. You can find different cuts, but it can sometimes take a bit of work.
* Never wring the water out of your swimsuit, it will weaken the fibres and seriously reduce its longevity. Simply squeeze it or use a suit spinner if there is one available.
* Baggy board shorts should not be used. Beginner and many intermediate swimmers have problems with drag. Board shorts add even more drag and make improving your stroke even more difficult.
* If you insist on using baggy shorts, please wear something tight underneath, because I have seen too many scrotums and assholes and I‚Äôm not even a paid professional.
* How you look or feel in a swimsuit does not correlate with how well you swim.
* There are three materials for swim caps: cloth, latex and silicone. Cloth is comfortable but otherwise useless, usually used by hotels to keep patrons from getting hair in filters. Latex lasts moderately well but snags hairs more. Silicone which is most expensive lasts longest but is also thickest and may be too warm for some people. No swim cap lasts for ever though. I never get more than a year from a cap.
* Swim caps will last longer if your dry them between uses, and better yet sprinkle with talcum powder.
* If you have a problem with the swim cap coming off your head while swimming, look for ones which have parallel ridges running around the inside edge.

**Pool Hygiene**

* Pool swimming took a leap forward in the 1960s once reliable swim googles became widely available and training sessions for Olympic swimmers were able to last for 3000 metres or even a whole hour! 
* Goggles are essential for pool swimming because most pools use chemicals to make the water safe. [I have a longer post explaining the interactions of pool chemicals and people in more detail here](https://loneswimmer.com/2013/06/14/how-to-why-you-should-always-shower-before-you-use-the-pool-and-why-you-shouldnt-pee-in-it/).
* Pools that have a strong chlorine or chemical smell are LESS clean than pools that have little or no odour.  The less the chemical smell, the cleaner the pool water.
* Pool-water colour has little relationship to pool water quality. Most pools use pool tiles to make the water look blue. Some even add small amounts of copper into the water for the same reason. 
* Just because you‚Äôve read that swimmers pee in the pool doesn‚Äôt mean you have to. But if you do want to stay being a swimmer, you should probably reconcile yourself to the fact that you are absolutely swimming in dilute urine. If this is really troubling you, best of luck with your sex life.
* It may not be chlorine that‚Äôs making your eyes burn. The pool may have the wrong water acidity (high or low). Soda-ash is added to pool water to control this.
* Of course, if there are too many organics (sweat, urine etc) in the pool, then more chlorine must also be added to balance the pool.

**Food & drink & peeing**

* Cold air in the pool deck or changing rooms, cold showers etc, evaporation of water from skin all cause the skin temperature to drop. This raises blood pressure as less blood flows and the hormone that suppresses urination is reduced. All this causes you to need to pee more. It‚Äôs completely normal.
* Therefore swimmers need to be more careful about hydration. Experienced swimmers will always drink during training.
* Yer Mammy was wrong. You can swim after eating.  All marathon distance swimmers like myself have to eat/take nutrition during swims for example. However, your body will be using air to digest food and use energy for exercise at the same time, so you will feel sluggish at best.

**Effort & Diet**

* It is extremely common that new swimmers, regardless of or more likely due to prior experience in other sports, underestimate the overall difficulty of swimming and overestimate how much energy they are expending. If you haven‚Äôt mastered breathing and are desperately out of breath this does not mean you expending significant energy.
* Calorie consumption rates in swimming given by website, apps or wearable fitness trackers or watches cannot be trusted because the variables are too varied. Weight, water temperature, stroke, experience, rests, set and session duration all play a part. I could say it‚Äôs almost certainly less than what any of those are telling you for an hour swimming.
* Pools are lower than body temperature and conduct heat away. So your body does start using energy to retain heat. The effect lasts after the swim is over. This makes swimming an appetite enhancer. Swimmers notoriously eat a lot. For beginner swimmers, you need to learn to control this.
* Most people with a good but average diet will have sufficient energy in blood and liver stores to sustain two hours of high intensity exercise. So it is not essential to ‚Äúpre-load‚Äù in advance of daily swimming

**How much should you swim?**

* How much you should swim depends obviously on your goals. However since swimming is technically difficult skill, it is safe to say than more swimming is better.
* But how much? As a general guideline I recommend four times a week, 2000 metres at a time is a good aim. Beginners won‚Äôt be able to swim anywhere near this distance, so let‚Äôs say 40 minutes a session.

**Injury & other physical problems**

* ‚ÄúSwimming is low impact sport, with little chance of causing injury‚Äú. This is a widely repeated misconception. Apart from the obvious, front crawl injuries to the shoulders do occur, caused by overuse and poor technique. You can get injured with only a small amount of swimming.
* The best ways to reduce the risk are to improve your technique and ALWAYS do a little backstroke each session. Backstroke is a stabilising exercise for front crawl. It helps strengthen the opposing muscles in the shoulder muscles to assist in keeping your shoulders balanced. It does not have to be a good technique to be effective.
* Does sleeping on your side cause discomfort? The cause is almost certainly tendonitis. This will not get better by itself, or with rest or by reducing swimming. I recommend some deep tissue massage, direct icing and physiotherapy, in that order as required, with massage & ice fixing ninety percent of problems.
* Water in your ear is easiest dislodged by bouncing on the heel of the leg on the same side as the water. If this doesn‚Äôt work, have a shower and stand with your ear up under the water. If this doesn‚Äôt work, try a drop of rubbing alcohol (surgical spirit). Wear ear plugs if this is a repeat problem.
* Asthma prevalence is correlated to regular swimming. The simplest and most effective treatment is to use your Daily Preventer, that you may not want to use daily.

Remember the best swimmer in the one having the most fun!

(Small edit: I've been asked about my flair here previously. Waay back in the early aeons of r/fitness when all the mods were different, the then mods applied flair to some contributors to indicate their expertise in particular areas. I was then the only Channel swimmer here at that time).

9tkzzj,Fitness,Things To Know About The Services For Juvederm Injection Kirkwood Professionals Are Offering,"By Nancy Murphy
   
   
For most people, facial aging is an inevitable part of growing old. Between dynamic wrinkles that are caused by underlying facial tension, and static wrinkling due to volume loss, most consumers come to hardly recognize themselves over time. The good news is that there are safe and non-invasive ways to delay these developments and reverse their overall impact on your appearance. Following is everything you need to know about the options in [Juvederm injection Kirkwood](https://www.diamondlasermedspa.com/services) companies supply.
   
   
 This solution is made from an acid that already exists throughout your entire body. This is hyaluronic acid, which is found in your connective tissues, the underlying layers of your skin, and your joints. Due to its natural composition, Juvederm is unlikely to cause adverse reactions or other serious side effects.
   
   
 HA provides your skin with a wealth of benefits. To start, it helps rebuilt the stores of HA that exist throughout the deepest layers of your dermis as soon as it is injected. In addition to supporting the skin in areas with mild to moderate aging, these treatments effectively replace the volume that gets lost around the nasolabial folds, jawline and cheekbones.
   
   
 After your provider has inserted Juvederm into your skin, this solution will effectively attach to skin cells in the area. Next, it will achieve full saturation by attracting water molecules and retaining them. This is what creates the fuller and more youthful look that patients expect and it replaced lost volume. All of the skin will be completely hydrated at every level. As such, patients will walk away with plump, dewy skin that is reminiscent of their youth.
   
   
 There are many advantages gained when you opt to use Juvederm as part of your anti-aging plan. The first of these is the ability to reverse the effects of the natural aging process without going under the knife. There are no incisions with these treatments, no tissue is actually removed, and no significant alterations are being made to the actual facial structure. As a result, there is very little recovery time that people have to deal with as well.
   
   
 During these procedures, a small-sized needle is used to insert nominal amounts of this solution into the skin. By only using limited quantities of this substance at once, your provider can make sure that your results are smooth and natural. This product contains ample amounts of lidocaine as well so that there is virtually no pain when the injections are performed.
   
   
 The entire treatment process takes only minutes to complete. In fact, most procedures can be done within just 15 to 20 minutes. This is why many people have been calling Juvederm the lunchtime facelift. It is possible to have this work performed on your lunch break, and without having to take any time off of work. Some people experience a slight amount of swelling and redness immediately after their procedures, but these developments tend to be short-lived and eventually go away on their own.
   
   
 There are several versions of this solution. Some last for just six to nine months whereas other, cross-linked formulas can last as long as two years. Younger-lasting formulas can also be used to augment the lips and to reshape and refine the nose in non-surgical rhinoplasty procedures.

9mrlbf,Fitness,Assessment of current routine.,"Alright ya'll, here we go..

&nbsp;

I am a 27 y.o. dude weighing in at 128 lbs. I have had a bit of strength training experience. I lifted daily for about a year, roughly 3 years ago. I started back up fresh mid-July of this year at around 120 lbs. Goals are to increase body mass to 145 lbs initially, followed by a drive to 165 lbs. My rate of weight gain has been roughly 1 lb/wk with my current surplus. Lifting goals are primarily for aesthetics, increased strength, and healthy longevity; in that order of importance.

&nbsp;

In my previous attempts in lifting I didn't make any commitments to consuming more food. I saw some okay strength gains, but never acquired much mass (which makes sense). My past uncontrolled dieting put me at enough calories to hold maintenance between 120 and 125 lbs, never deviating for almost the last 10 years. This time I've committed to increasing my food intake, doing about 2600-2700 kcal daily and was initially seeing about 1 lb/wk gain for the first several weeks. I have since gotten sloppy on counting calories, so some days I'm at the intake goal and some days I probably fall a little short; I'm working to fix this ASAP.

&nbsp;

Since starting back up, I have been working the StrongLifts 5x5 program. The 3 days/week routine has been working well for me and I have managed to work around any past plateaus by making corrections to form and making myself some 1.25lbs weights to help grind through upper body progression. On rare occasion, missing a day of lifting helped me to put the weight up the following workout, thanks to some extra rest. My progression chart is linked [here](https://imgur.com/a/TbmnkA4). The large dip in squat and deadlift weight was due to a quad strain which I deloaded to recover from, also bettering my form in the process.

&nbsp;

Current lifts are the following, each for 5x5:

* Squat - 225 lbs
* Conventional DL - 225 lbs (1x5)
* Bent over rows - 120 lbs
* Bench - 125 lbs (5/5/5/4/4 on 130 lbs)
* Overhead press - 85 lbs

&nbsp;

My squat is now at 1.76x my body weight. It has been difficult as all hell to keep up with squatting this weight 3 times per week. I'm sure ya'll can commiserate; sucking wind like you've almost drowned, wobbling like a top, after just 2 of the 5 reps, whimpering a little to yourself before you take in another big breath to squeeze out the next rep til you're donezo.

&nbsp;

Now for the questions.. I know there are no definite answers. In the opinions of those who browse this sub, do you think I should be moving on to another program? Perhaps I should simply modify, relegating squats to only one of the exercise rotations (A or B), and supplementing the missing exercise with another strong compound movement? I find that I am still progressing in all lifts, it's just that the 3 days of squatting this portion of my body weight is getting to my head some days, in an overwhelming sense. Should I just suck it up and grind through it?

Very open to suggestions, everyone. Also very willing to reply to comments with more detailed information as requested.

Much appreciated.",2018-10-09 18:15:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/9mrlbf/assessment_of_current_routine/
9iddcw,Fitness,Some Basic Facts You Should Know Before Getting A Brazilian Blowout Denver,"By Michael Schmidt

Your investment will also give your locks a radiant, glossy look owing to the keratin solution applied during the treatment procedure. You may choose to maintain the natural curly texture or give your hair an all new straight look.
   
   
 You can get solutions that work in your best interests. For instance, if your tresses are naturally curly and you like them this way, you can simply use the keratin solution to reduce the frizz. In this case, you would merely be ensuring that your curls are more shiny and manageable.
   
   
 Most people will want to know how long-lasting the results are. Well, one treatment can last for about four months. It remains imperative to understand that the longevity of your treatment will also depend on how frequently you shampoo and condition your tresses each week.
   
   
 If you want to maintain the flair of a treatment and also keep your tresses looking voluminous, you should use mild conditioners and shampoo. You must also not use products that contain chlorine or sulfate. Finally, avoid washing your hair more than two times each week.

917cqq,Fitness,Natural Beauty Treatments Fairfield NJ Women May Try For Various Issues,"By Donald Cox
   
   
The kitchen is where you will find food that can provide the body with nourishment. It's also a place where there are many things that can be used for dealing with an assortment of skin related matters. The following are some really simple yet highly effective natural [beauty treatments Fairfield NJ](www.anagen-hair-face-body-solutions.com/facial-treatments) women may try at any given time or day.
   
   
 Plain yogurt for a radiant complexion. Constantly, dead skin cells pile on top of one another. In time, this can cause your complexion to appear dull and lifeless. A very simple way to restore a radiant complexion is by applying plain yogurt on the skin twice a week. It should be left in place for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing it off with cold water.
   
   
 Apple cider vinegar for zits and acne. Numerous kinds of soaps and creams for zits and acne are available. Sadly, most of them are expensive, not to mention that certain chemicals in them can irritate skin. If you're bugged by zits and acne and you want to get rid of them in a natural manner, count on apple cider vinegar. Apply with a cotton swab and let it remain on those zits and acne for around 10 minutes.
   
   
 Erase wrinkles and fine lines using lemon juice. Proper synthesis of collagen requires vitamin C, which is something that is present in lemon juice. This is why the sour liquid is regarded as an all natural anti aging agent. All you have to do is combine equal parts of water and lemon juice, and then gently massage on those wrinkles and fine lines. Wait for 5 to 10 minutes before washing your face with water. For dramatic results, do this morning and night.
   
   
 Coconut oil for dry and flaky skin. Every beauty conscious woman should never forget to maintain optimum skin moisture. An excellent moisturizing product available in most kitchens is coconut oil.

 Egg whites for shrinking gigantic pores. Having large pores can keep you from posting close up photos of yourself on social media. To deal with this very common problem, lightly beat the white of an egg. Wash and dry your face, and then apply it all over. Allow it to stay there for 20 to 30 minutes until it's already dry. Carefully peel off dried egg white and then rinse your face with cold water afterwards.

907br4,Fitness,PSA: Use the Sauna,"I came across this information some time ago and I am actually shocked that I couldn't find the article here on r/Fitness. A few videos have been posted before but not the actual analysis *complete with references*. 

The benefits of the sauna are incredible for fitness but also for overall health / longevity. If you are, per your doctor, healthy enough to enter one you should.

Here is an excerpt of the benefits compiled by Dr. Rhonda Patrick. 

**[And here is the full article, it's 15 pages but the last 4 pages are all references.](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/reports/sauna-report.pdf)**

> Acclimating your body to heat stress by intermittent whole-body hyperthermia through sauna use (‚Äúhyperthermic conditioning‚Äù) has been shown to:

> Enhance endurance by:

>* Increasing nutrient delivery to muscles thereby reducing the
depletion of glycogen stores.
* Reducing heart rate and reducing core temperature during workload.
Increase muscle hypertrophy by preventing protein degradation through
the following three means:
* Induction of heat shock proteins and a hormetic response (which has
also been shown to increase longevity in lower organisms).
* Cause a massive release of growth hormone.
* Improving insulin sensitivity.

> **NOTE** It also accomplishes this arguably without the same risk that
might otherwise be associated with exogenous or supraphysiological
levels of other hormones, like growth hormone.

> Hyperthermic conditioning also has robust positive effects on the brain:

> * Increases the storage and release of norepinephrine, which improves
attention and focus.
* Increases prolactin, which causes your brain to function faster by
enhancing myelination and helps to repair damaged neurons.
* Increases BDNF, which causes the growth of new brain cells, improves
the ability for you to learn new information and retain it, and
ameliorates certain types of depression and anxiety.
* Causes a robust increase in dynorphin, which results in your body
becoming more sensitive to the ensuing endorphins.",2018-07-19 16:24:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/907br4/psa_use_the_sauna/
8xngm8,Fitness,I want to run a mile a day,"Reasons I want to do it:

* It's good for me
* I don't currently have an exercise plan and want something free
* A mile doesn't take long, and this is important to me because I got serious running about a decade ago and became annoyed at how long a few miles took to run, and I think I stopped running because of it. The thought of ""boom a 10 minute mile (faster after i get unfat) and you're done"" is fucking alluring.
* A mile a day adds up (7 miles a week running - respectable, even 5 miles a week still acceptable number, I probably plan in taking weekends off)
* I'm mid 30s and about 60lbs overweight (this is accompanying a lifestyle change), so a short, effective workout benefits the longevity left in my knees for running
* Less chance for endurance related injuries for being only a mile


My goal is to always be out of breath when I'm done with the mile, ensuring that I'm always getting a ""full"" workout

Basically I feel that a mile a day would be extremely beneficial and I'm looking for opinions if my thoughts are in the right place or not. On one hand the idea of a fast, effective workout is incredibly appealing and surprisingly justifiable, and on the other hand is the thought ""a workout takes time"". How effective is a mile a day vs more vs sedentary?

8whq14,Fitness,How important is shoulder mobility training?,"I don't do any stretching in my routine. I'm currently on month 3 of nSuns 5/3/1 strength training program. 

I do my heavy lifts followed by 3-4   tricep isolation exercises in the 6-8 rep range for 3 working sets on chest/shoulders day and conclude with dips. 

Lately I've been getting stiff traps/neck and it's hard to turn my head unless I sleep in the perfect position all night.

I'm getting extremely strong from the program but I feel my shoulder mobility is suffering. Should I start doing shoulder specific stretching post workout before the cooldown? Static stretching pre workout is out of the question as it reduces power output. 

Any list of recommended stretches? Looking for advice.

 Strength and power for 11 years of lifting has always been my priority but as I get older (male , 27) I realize I need to start taking a more proactive approach with longevity in mind.

888n5t,Fitness,The Benefits Of Botox Treatment Boca Raton,"By Mark Hughes
   
   
Applying cosmetic enhancement can prove risky without the correct research and professional applications. With more people interested in wrinkle reduction and restoration of a youthful skin, alternative procedures have gained increased attention. For [Botox treatment Boca Raton](http://www.nulaserhair.com/botox-services-pompano-beach-fl/) communities can learn about the therapy from a certified and experienced practitioner from its possible limitations to its physical results.
   
   
 Botox is scientifically known as Botulinum toxin and is an FDA approved solution for men and women interested in facial enhancement. The solution is injected into the skin with thin needles causing minimal discomfort and noticeable results in only a few hours. Once the swelling and redness at the site of the injection have decreased, patients can expect a tighter and smoother tone.
   
   
 If you constantly frown or squint your eyes, these areas can form the fine lines associated with aging, but occurs because of facial muscle movement. The ongoing contraction and flex of the muscles will cause creases in the affected regions of the skin, leaving you without a full and smooth appearance. Facelifts are invasive and take time to heal compared to the efficiency of injectable filler.
   
   
 Botox has a longevity of 6 months, but it can last up to a year and should always be administered by approved institutions and professional practitioners. The application of fillers has become increasingly popular, which has contributed to many disreputable services. With reliance on the assistance of an experienced and certified therapist it can prevent a compromised outcome.
   
   
 Experienced and certified professionals will apply the solution in office without the need for costly clinical stays and the performance of routine actions. Such procedure can assist patients who wish to benefit from non-invasive practices where a few fine lines require improvement. If you have a single frown line or few crows feet, then Botox is a better solution for relief.
   
   
 If you suffer from a few frown lines or wrinkles slowly appear on your forehead or around the mouth and eyes, this product is most effective. It cannot remove wrinkles in the neck and not eliminate all facial wrinkles, but it can prevent and minimize further lines from developing. Your practitioner can provide before and after images of what you can expect.
   
   
 Botox is the most in-demand product for facial fillers and cosmetic aesthetics in the market, but it can further decrease chronic disease. Individuals who experience excess sweating under the arms, along the palms or under the feet can benefit from the filler by preventing the over-activity of the glands. Migraines and headaches have also been controlled with the use of this innovative product and must be discussed with your doctor before proceeding with treatment.
   
   
 To achieve an attractive appearance without the cost and complexities of invasive surgery requires consultation with a cosmetic therapist. Your practitioner will examine your condition and advise on suitability for the practices delivered including the results you can expect. An experienced professional can deliver a superb enhancement to help restore your appearance and manage a range of chronic clinical conditions.

Search for ranges including vitamin C and hyaluronic acid that targets wrinkles and supports the improvement in the skin. With reliance on nourishing and protective products, you can achieve a smooth and supple complexion for the most effective results.

Achieving a beautiful smooth and youthful complexion assists in delivering the best results.
   
   
 Botox has become a fast and effective means of producing a smoother complexion owing to its simple application and instant reduction in wrinkles when delivered by a professional therapist. The formulation assists in the decrease of wrinkling, an improvement in sag, and smoothing of areas that lack volume. It aims to address the fine lines around the eyes and corners of the mouth that contribute to a lack of youthful appeal.
   
   
 Achieving a smooth and beautiful complexion requires assistance from a professional and an experienced therapist to produce enhancement. Achieving a balanced diet and remaining well hydrated will provide the most advantageous solutions to minimize the formation of wrinkles. Botox remains an effective solution to smooth the skin and produce a complexion that is supple and free from fine lines.

7guvog,Fitness,What You Need To Know About Teeth Whitening Bellingham,"By Sandra Peterson
   
   
Whiter brighter teeth is what most desire, but achieving this goal through conventional means or home remedies may not prove beneficial. The best way to eliminate stains and improve your smile is to meet with a professional dentist who can advise on lasting cosmetic solutions. With the following tips for professional [teeth whitening Bellingham](http://ift.tt/2yBSd4O) communities can expect exceptional dental results.
   
   
 Stained and darkened teeth may be caused by eating sugary or highly acidic foods, red wines coffee and other dark liquids, but can also be attributed to medication. While surface stains are common, internal changes and trauma can also cause your tooth to alter in appearance. If you are dissatisfied with the look of your oral condition, consult with your dentist to learn of the enhancements available.
   
   
 Brighter and whiter teeth are best achieved with the assistance of a professional and an experienced dentist. The completion of an oral assessment can determine why a tooth has suffered stains or darkening internally and the methods needed to correct such dysfunction. An individualized exam completed by a professional practitioner can determine the best means of improving the appearance of oral structures.
   
   
 A professional approach to tooth whitening aims to remove surface stains and improve the condition of teeth. Procedures performed in a clinical set are more costly than regular store products, but the value and longevity it provides far outweighs the expense. Meeting with your dentist will help you learn of the options available and the best ways of achieving a more aesthetic and functional result.
   
   
 A professional and certified dentist can provide clinical procedure including ultra-violet light on an affected tooth to eradicate stains. When discoloration is apparent, professional solutions can improve and support its aesthetic qualities for a beautiful smile. An experienced practitioner can determine effective options for intervention with an individualized evaluation of teeth and the underlying causes for yellow or brown surfaces.
   
   
 Alternative products are available from your dentist and may assist in cases of mild stains or yellowed teeth. These products contain high percentages of hydrogen peroxide and applied to the tooth surface with the purpose of eliminating the stains and the discoloration from the enamel. It is only beneficial if the problems have formed on the tooth surface and not the inside of the tooth, but can cause sensitivity if improperly used.
   
   
 Toothpastes and mouth rinses that claim to whiten smiles may help prevent discoloration from developing, but cannot remove stains already present. Changes in diet including the elimination of caffeine, red wine and highly sugary or processed foods can assist in preventing stains. Incorporate fruit such as strawberries and rinse your mouth with water after consuming foods to minimize acid buildup.
   
   
 Where darkened tooth surfaces and severe stains are impacting your lifestyle, it is time to meet with an experienced dentist for effective maintenance solutions. A practitioner will assess the presence of stains and yellow or brown tooth colors and look into the source for these changes before advising on effective enhancement and restoration. Understanding the measures involved and taking time to enhance your smile, is best achieved with non-invasive dental solutions.

7db3nu,Fitness,Ways To Purchase Hemp Lotion,"By Haywood Hunter
   
   
Hemp lotion is a product that is starting to increase in its over popularity these days. Much of this is due to not only its overall effectiveness, but many other benefits as well. Even so, some people may question what the product is all about, how it works or might benefit, as well as what the difference is between hemp and that of the well-known plant that it comes from in reality.
   
   
 Hemp can consist of many different parts of the marijuana plant, including oil and the fiber that can be obtained from it to make various items. For instance, people commonly see items made from the plant, such as rope, purses, among many other things. The oil is commonly used in cooking and for creating a variety of skin products, generally due to its skin-boosting properties.
   
   
 There tends to be some confusion or misconceptions involved with hemp. This is often due to how some compare it to the plant and its other known effects, namely due to THC. However, since hemp is THC-free, it is safe for people of all ages and bears none of the known side effects.
   
   
 The oil is commonly used in various beauty products due to its many different health benefits. It's rich in calcium, vitamin D, Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, and it works as a great moisturizer, even on its own. Because it's also eco-friendly, many people feel rest assured that its production won't harm or take away from the environment as much as other oils are sometimes known to do.
   
   
 The oil is well known for many things, but more commonly its skin-boosting benefits. While it can make for a wonderful moisturize, being that it's an oil, its lipids also closely mimic the ones found in the human skin. The human skin is the body's largest organ and has a 33% absorbency rate, which is another reason why people appreciate having the oil in lotion form. It's also idea for fighting against the aging of the skin, even while it provides a natural moisture balance.
   
   
 When it comes to the oil's specific health benefits, things may potential go further than anti-aging or moisturizing. Some of the properties found in help are said to help the body fight certain cancers, although this would likely involve certain skin cancers when used externally. It's also said to help people maintain a dandruff-free, healthy scalp and thick, hair.
   
   
 Many people have discovered just how beneficial the oil can be, even aside from its moisturizing and health benefits. For instance, some of its natural properties are known to help a variety of skin ailments. This might include eczema, minor abrasions, acne, and psoriasis.
   
   
 Different types of hemp lotion can be found in online and offline locations. Selecting the best one will usually depend on preference, scent, along with trial and error. Some individuals like to ensure that the product they receive is free of certain preservatives and other harmful ingredients. Fortunately, many lotions based around this type of oil often meet this need. Things such as consistency and scent may also differ with each product, with some have the natural scent of the oil and others having a different fragrance added.

When one grows old, which for our purposes means 25 years old or older, one begins to think less about getting laid and more about staving off one's inevitable physical decline and death. Feels bad man.  

&nbsp;

Anyways, what do you guys think is the optimal muscle mass for longevity?  Muscular weakness is a direct or indirect cause of a TON of health problems as people age.  Yet, too much mass means you are cranking up the metabolic furnace... putting lots of miles on your car so to speak, which can make it break down sooner.  

&nbsp;

Is there any good research or reading on this?  Most recommendations to increase strength target untrained sedentary people, or maybe people who only do cardio.

77cxk8,Fitness,Airbrush Tan For The Most Amazing Color,"By Haywood Hunter
   
   
The most efficient way of applying sunless tanning products is using airbrush tan technology. In your favorite tanning salon, lovely bronze color will be applied by a technician who is highly experienced and educated for this job. This person will make sure your new bronze is absolutely flawless and really impeccable.
   
   
 Airbrush tan technology used in professional salons uses air compressors for creating fine mist of tiny particles. This way your selected product is applied evenly on each and every part of your skin. You just cannot achieve better results using any other method. That's why you should use professional services for achieving the best possible results.
   
   
 Although you are perfectly able to apply any fake-tan product in your own bathroom, airbrush tan fake tan specialist can still do better job. Full body exfoliation is essential prior to the treatment. This will ensure very nice final results and longevity of your beautiful bronze. The technician will immediately fix eventual mistakes.
   
   
 Full body exfoliation is necessary for removing all dead skin cells and making your skin smooth. Sunless tanning products containing DHA react only with the most outer skin layer, and your color is the result of this reaction. Regular moisturizing after the treatment is important for maintaining your bronze and keeping your skin soft and hydrated.
   
   
 Your lovely bronze color applied using airbrush tan technology lasts for a week, but it gradually fades. Using good quality moisturizers can keep color intensity a little longer. Good hydration is essential for keeping your skin healthy and smooth, especially when it is very dry or sensitive. Professionally applied new layer of your favorite sunless tanning product will keep you bronzed all summer.
   
   
 If you are using razors for removing your body hair, make sure to shave at least a day before airbrush tan treatment. Freshly shaved skin might get tiny spots, because the skin needs some time to heal itself after shaving. When you have a fake tan, be very careful when shaving. Make sure to replace your old razor with a new one.
   
   
 Wear loose clothes and shoes when visiting your salon. Most fabrics can be easily washed if you stain them, but wear darker clothes anyway. Bring your old bathing suit with you, or use a disposable one. Some salons will offer you a treatment in their airbrush tan booths as well. You can get lovely all-over color there, if you are shy.
   
   
 Don't worry, the color won't stain your favorite clothes or linens once it finally sets. Considering the fact that your bronze airbrush tan averagely lasts a week or so, you will have to apply another layer occasionally. Good moisturizing is highly important for maintaining your bronze. Remember to exfoliate before taking your next airbrush tan treatment. If you take a good care of your skin, you can keep your lovely golden glow all through the summer.
   
   
 Considering the risks related to sunbathing, sunless tanning products are the best alternative, if you still want to have sun-kissed skin. Among all other ways of applying your favorite sunless tanning lotion, airbrush tan is certainly the best option available. Beautiful bronze complexion enhances everyone's appearance.

757wbp,Fitness,What To Understand Concerning Bariatric Weight Loss Surgery,"By Charles Johnson
   
   
Generally, severe obesity is usually a serious stage of obesity. However, you might be struggling with too much weights and feel as if you are trapped in a cycle of gaining weight. As a result, you may be tempted to try various diets only to see an increase instead of losing some pounds. Nevertheless, through [bariatric weight loss surgery](http://ift.tt/2jKaN43), you are able to lose some weight.
   
   
 When the bariatric procedure is combined with another comprehensive treatment, it offers an effective tool for weight-loss for a long time. This procedure has been found to resolve and improve some conditions associated with obesity. Such conditions are such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes type 2 among others. But by losing some pounds, fewer medications are required in the treatment of conditions related to obesity.
   
   
 This bariatric procedure involves the application of different forms of treatment like adjustable laparoscopic operation on the gastric banding, sleeve, and bypass. The main activity in this form involves changing the size of the gastrointestinal tract to a lesser volume area that reduces the physiological processes connected with food metabolism as well as the balance of body energy.
   
   
 However, this method involves your decisions and views that are arrived at after an intensive education provided to you by your surgeon. On the other hand, these tools deal with just a small percentage of the problem. The rest is dealt with by lifestyle, behavior, nutrition and other factors that need change and adjustments.
   
   
 The procedures are more preferred to dietary changes as sometimes altering the daily diets may cause gaining of weight. The altering of the production of hormones causes the person to lose the excess fat as it enhances use if energy and allows constant burning of calories.
   
   
 Usually, there is a long-term success with the surgical procedures. According to some studies, over 90 percent of people suffering from severe obesity have been able to maintain about 50% or more of the weight-loss after the surgery. For this reason, the surgical procedure has been found to last longer.
   
   
 Other than the losing weights, there are other benefits of this surgical procedure. For instance, patients experience improved longevity. This is because an individual with severe obesity experiences a lower risk of death after the surgery. This is unlike severe obesity patients who usually experience poor health and suffer from one or several life-threatening conditions.
   
   
 Another benefit is that there is a change in psychological status and quality of life after the surgical procedure. Usually, the quality of life that is positively affected by the procedure are such as mobility, social interactions, sexual function, and work. Also, anxiety and depression are reduced significantly.

738x6x,Fitness,I need help getting on the correct path to improve.,"Hi everyone! I spend most of my time here reading and learning, so I've never really posted that much. However, lately I've felt like I've come to a dead end, or that I'm not setting myself up in the most optimal way. To start off, I'm 27 years old, male, 6' 3"", I weigh 196lbs/88.9kg as of this morning. My current S/B/D for 5rm are listed below:

Back Squat: 230lbs/104kg
Barbell Bench: 140lbs/63.5kg
Trap-Bar DL: 260lbs/118kg

I currently run the Reddit PPL, as I really enjoy being able to train six days a week. I've been eating 4,000-4,500 calories for the past 2-3 weeks, hoping it would help me break through any strength plateaus. So with that said, I've been running into two problems here that I can't seem to identify what I'm doing wrong or rather what I should do. 

1. Seeing that my lifts are still at the novice level, I'm still having a very difficult time following that linear progression, i.e. adding 5lbs to my squat and bench possibly the barbell row too. My deadlift feels easier to progress I've gotten to 280lbs with a trap bar. Even weekly I have trouble adding weight and I've read that even intermediate lifter can still progress weekly I think. I might be wrong. 

I've really been focused on increasing my numbers because I was watching one of Alpha Destiny's videos on YouTube that as a natural you must get stronger to put on size. I understand that progressive overload isn't as simple as simple adding 5lbs and feeling immediately stronger, but I just feel stuck. When I do add weight, either I can't reach depth in my squat or my bench press so it ends up being a partial or I simply can't do it at all. 

Second, I've been battling in my head whether to bulk or cut. Now starting off, I recognize that beginner/novice lifters will bulk for a short period starting losing abs then freak out and start cutting again getting nowhere. I've told myself to avoid that mistake by following through this bulk hoping more calories would aid in strength gains. Recently I've watched Alan Thrall's video where he says that plateauing is largely your own fault not the program, that you're simply undereating or not sleeping enough. So I began eating more. I usually sleep 7-8 hours a night. I feel I'm severely wasting my time bulking if it's not aiding me in the gym. I see so many people sing praises of bulking saying they hit pr's etc. But I don't understand why it's not helping me. With the years I've put in, I feel I should be much farther along than I currently am, and right now I'm trying to put myself in a position where I can't lose, by optimizing every variable and yet I'm obviously messing up somewhere. I sleep 7-8 hours, I should plenty if not too much of a surplus, and I'm following a good program.

I apologize that this post may be long-winded but I wanted to be sure I got enough info out there so you all can offer advice. I'm just at a point where the lifter in me is crying out for help. I thought I could figure it out on my own by keeping it simple (eat, sleep, lift) but I'm missing something somewhere. As far as my goals go, I just want to be big and strong, have longevity and be able to support myself when I'm an old man. I understand that being tall that it takes longer to fill out this frame, but I feel like if I'm not getting stronger then I'm not building optimal muscle.

Thanks so much for any help everyone!

71a2kh,Fitness,Important Information On The Rewards Of Natural Pomegranate Skin Care,"By Karen Howard
   
   
Generally, consumption of pomegranate type of fruits is obvious a beautiful experience to most people. One of the reason is the seed removal mechanism where you do it physically. This activity comes with certain reasons like need to feel the taste. However, nutrition compounds in these seeds are also present. On the other hand, skin care can also be done using them. This means [natural pomegranate skin care](www.edensent.com/) is a very fruitful experience to a person.
   
   
 This fruit provides numerous advantages for skins and can be utilized in different ways to improve it. Firstly, you can use its seeds to make an exfoliator.

Instead of the directly applying it onto your skin like the above choices, you only need to drink juice made from this fruit or eat loads of its seeds every day. Consequently, the course of aging is decelerated. This fruit has been found to lessen fine lines of extra skin and wrinkles as they obstruct skin regeneration and hyperpigmentation.
   
   
 When oil from its seeds is used to provide cleansing, certain rewards are guaranteed. One of the ways to make sure that your skin is always shiny is by application of this oil when cleansing. Oils from plants like sesame, olive tree, jojoba, and coconut are also used alongside this plant one. That means the use of this fruit oil provides a similar and even more benefit. The oil contains flavonoids and other acids responsible for nourishing skins.
   
   
 In addition, this fruit is known to enhance the texture. Fundamentally, they can extend the lifespan of fibroblasts which are proteins that are in charge of producing elastin and collagen. By consuming juice made from pomegranates daily, you will be averting the degeneration of elastin and collagen.

6yhfdk,Fitness,I'm not sure I understand glycemic load,"Most people who talk about glycemic load really don't go into specifics, they just describe it as glycemic index adjusted for serving size.
From what I've gathered glycemic load describes how much your blood sugar levels will spike after eating, but how about the longevity of the spike? I've deduced that the glycemic index gives you two pieces of information: how large the blood sugar spike is per gram of carbohydrate and how long it will last. The glycemic load on the other hand only tells you how much your blood sugar is gonna spike. That's all well and good, but it seems like everyone who talks about glycemic load and index say that you should only care about glycemic load. 
Can someone clarify?
EDIT:
I forgot to ask, but I also would really like to know if there is any reason why a non-diabetic would want a meal with a low glycemic load instead of a medium glycemic load. I understand that exposing yourself to constant high glycemic loads can lead to problems in the long run, but what about medium glycemic loads, are they less beneficial in any way when compared to low glycemic loads?",2017-09-06 18:18:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6yhfdk/im_not_sure_i_understand_glycemic_load/

138pw9d,gainit,F/40/5‚Äô7‚Äù ~ 5 mo. bulk progress,"https://imgur.com/a/WZRnvPb

I wanted to share my bulk progress with this community because it provided me a lot of motivation and encouragement, especially when I was having challenging days or questioning myself.

I‚Äôve been weight training since college (some periods more consistent than others) and have pretty much always had the same physique. It wasn‚Äôt until recently (the past 3 years) that I started counting macros which has helped my strength increase because I started actually getting enough protein. Imagine that! 

It really never crossed my mind to bulk until last year. Some of my motivation was aesthetic, however as I was approaching my 40th birthday it got me thinking more about bulking benefits in terms of longevity. I have a small frame and don‚Äôt want to be a tiny, weak old lady one day. Lol 

So the bulk started October 2022 where I was eating around 2000 calories until the end of February 2023 where I had gradually worked up to 2600 calories (140 g protein, 360 g carbs, 76 g fat). I followed a progressive overload strength training program 4x a week and walked 8-10k steps daily.

I gained about 11 pounds and saw my strength increase tremendously. I‚Äôm now slowly cutting back down a bit and feeling happy with the changes I‚Äôm seeing as far as muscle definition and how confident and strong I feel. I knew bulking would be physically challenging, but I didn‚Äôt anticipate how mentally exhausting it could be as my mind was constantly swirling around data every waking moment. 

I feel so proud to have tried something new and out of my comfort zone. I‚Äôm also very much looking forward to being back in maintenance for a very long time!",2023-05-05 14:39:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/138pw9d/f4057_5_mo_bulk_progress/
wn3hce,gainit,How much cardio while bulking?,"So before I started to bulk I used to run a mile first thing at the gym every day, fastest as I could. My mile time got down to 5:55, and I was super lean and vascular, but weak as hell. Thing is, I stopped running completely to focus on strength and hypertrophy gains, and naturally my conditioning has went to shit. I expected this, but now that I‚Äôm starting to get bigger and stronger, I‚Äôm incorporating cardio back in. I‚Äôm not super concerned about body fat, I just love the other benefits of cardio: healthy heart, generally tasks are much easier, more energy, run faster and further, etc. Being able to do all that stuff just feels so HUMAN if that makes any sense. I want to be able to keep gaining strength and size though. I need a lot more muscle still, I‚Äôm still quite small and weak (small and weak to me is very relative to my goals, naturally. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5 around 200lbs, my maxes for the 3 main lifts are all within 50lbs of 200lbs), so how much running could I get away with before it starts to effect my strength gains? I can always just eat another 300 calories a day to offset it I‚Äôm assuming, but I just want to make sure. I‚Äôm in to this for general health, longevity, being strong, and looking good. But the two latter are my top priorities right now, so I don‚Äôt want to do anything that would be detrimental to achieving them.

vtvfer,gainit,A little advice on diet,"Before bulking, work out what foods you can't tolerate.

Pissing out of your ass several times a day, getting stomach cramps, and waking up in the middle of the night with acid reflux is NOT normal or necessary, even on a bulk.

Bulk on the right foods - healthy foods but more importantly foods that don't cause you grief - and you might go to the toilet twice a day, instead of once like before. You may get the occasional and inexplicable stomach niggle. And you may sometimes get indigestion of some sort because you ate a big meal and deadlifted straight after.

But as a rule you shouldn't experience these things regularly or to any extreme. It's OK to feel full, but it's not OK to feel genuine malaise because the foods you are eating don't agree with you.

Some people are lactose intolerant, or wheat intolerant. In some people, coffee causes all kinds of trouble. Even some vegetables will cause problems, and beans. Unfortunately, some people get used to the thought that their guts are just messed up, and that's just the way it is, and in the case of something like coffee, they can become addicted. It becomes an every day thing to be in discomfort, but that needs to be addressed if you are interested in performance (and longevity).

So pay attention to the signals, consult a doctor (or ideally a dietician/nutritionist) and experiment with some exclusion diets. Fix it and you'll be able to eat more, because you'll be digesting easier, and your body will be better nourished, because the foods you put in will have a good environment in which to be processed, rather than a battleground.

It is well worth the investment to get your gut in order.",2022-07-07 22:55:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/vtvfer/a_little_advice_on_diet/

Since my last post, I've actually LOST about 5-7 lbs this year but increased my strength and lean muscle mass. Significantly.

# My workout:

My workout routine and philosophy have also evolved. **I don't do the high-volume workouts shared in my previous posts anymore**.

I now focus on **high-intensity:**

* 3 sets of my max pull-ups with a 35lbs weighted vest
* 3 sets of my max push-ups with a 35lbs weighted vest
* 3 sets of my max bicep curls with a 40lbs dumbbell
* 3 sets of my max leg raises

Focus on form and looking good. I count but I don't compare or analyze, I just go as hard as I can every time.

Oh, and you don't need to overtrain as I did for years. You can, but you don't need to. The time I spent recovering from injuries probably outweighs the additional load I was putting my muscles through.

# My diet:

My diet is the same apart from the fact I've been eating a bit less to lean out more. I got tired of wanting to become 170-180lbs and realized I'd look puffy anyway, so I've been focusing on aesthetics and longevity instead.

**Breakfast (10 AM):** 4 slices of homemade white bread with tahini (i.e sesame spread, healthier peanut butter alternative)

**Lunch (2 PM):** 150g chicken breast, 2 eggs, some bell peppers, basil, salt, slice of bread

**Afternoon meal (7 PM):** 2 slices of homemade white bread with tahini

**Dinner (11 PM):** 150g chicken breast, 2 eggs, some bell peppers, basil, salt, slice of bread

**Dessert:** Blended, frozen berries of all kinds, banana, dates. Not every day and not in large quantities.

# My supplements:

Not much has changed here.

* 400mg curcumin x3
* 125mg Boswellia Serrata x3
* 10g fish oil
* 1 sublingual Vitamin B12
* Vitamin D3 + K2 5000iu
* Stopped taking creatine and l-glutamine
* A few hits of the good shit in the evening

**Some of you might be wondering why I'm still posting in** /r/gainit **when I've actually lost weight since my last post.**

Well, it all began here for me. Back when I was dying in hospital and visualizing how I might look one day. At the time, it seemed impossible to even recover what I lost, let alone surpass it. But as banal as it sounds, when you're at the bottom the only way is up. And here we are now.

I've got a well-paying hustle. A hot girlfriend that wants my babies. A body which, although not anything special, looks fairly decent now. And I feel in control of what matters to me and don't sweat the things that don't.

I know there must be more of you here struggling with chronic disease.  Feeling weak and uncertain about the future. Stuck living in the past and reminiscing about the good old days when everything was fine..

But if you're reading this, you're alive. And while you're alive, you can fight and you can overcome.

jc08em,gainit,"Strategic Dirty Bulking: How To Phase ""Dirt"" Into The Diet","Hello once again Gainers,

**INTRO: WHAT IS A REAL DIRTY BULK**

I‚Äôm going to hate myself for using terms I can‚Äôt stand, but in the context of today, it works.  When discussing ‚Äúdirty bulking‚Äù, it needs to be understood that we‚Äôre going to use that phase in the way that actually makes sense: eating ‚Äúdirty food‚Äù.  Dirty food would be food that isn‚Äôt considered clean.  If you don‚Äôt know what clean food is, you‚Äôre being a petulant child, because the rest of us get it: clean food is food we understand to be healthful.  When you think ‚Äúbodybuilder in the last 6 weeks of prep‚Äù, you‚Äôre thinking clean foods.  Chicken breasts, lean fish, green veggies, plain white rice, sweet potatoes, etc.  Dirty foods are those things we understand to be NOT healthful: fast food, pizza, high fat meats, refined carbs, etc etc.  The idea that a dirty bulk is a bulk where you get fat and a clean bulk is one where you don‚Äôt is just stupid: the latter is a lean bulk, the former is just getting fat.

Ok, all that established, often times, one starts out a weight gain phase (god I hate the word ‚Äúbulk‚Äù/‚Äùbulking‚Äù) with the best of intentions as far as maintaining a healthful approach goes, but, eventually, they hit a stall.  You can only stomach so much food at a pop, and healthful food tends to be healthful BECAUSE it‚Äôs low in calories as a result of being low in superfluous macronutrients.  A chicken breast is almost pure protein compared to a ribeye steak, which is almost equal parts fat and protein.  An apple, though ‚Äúheavy‚Äù in sugar, also has lots of fiber that can counteract if you‚Äôre a net-carb kinda guy: apple pie filling, not so much.  You get the point.  Sometimes, in the pursuit of weight gain, it becomes necessary to loosen up on the clean aspect of the diet and allow some dirt in for the sake of fostering weight gain.

HOWEVER, eating dirty is way too easy.  The majority of Americans do that (other countries too I‚Äôm sure).  It‚Äôs too easy to get down a rabbit hole on this and end up wallowing in candy bar rappers and empty ice cream tubs.  A smart lifter is going to understand that there are phases to adding dirt to the diet, and that strategy must be employed in order to have a successful weight gain phase without getting stupid with it.  That having been understood, I‚Äôm going to outline the ways I‚Äôll sneak dirt into my diet as I gain weight, and my thought process behind it.  This is going to focus primarily on nutrition around the time of training, as I find that to be the most critical window to manipulate.  It‚Äôs pretty easy to add dirt to the rest of your diet, but here we‚Äôre going to employ some strategy.  Keep in mind once again that my default approach to nutrition is low-carb, so some of the things I consider to be dirt may just be the way you eat already.

**IN PRACTICE**


 **POST WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 1**

* There are enough nutritional studies out there that say you can pretty much eat as many simple carbs as you want post workout that it‚Äôs definitely something worth taking advantage of when your goal is weight gain.  If you‚Äôre coming out this super clean, you could add some dried fruit and honey post workout and easily ratchet up an extra few hundred carbs.  However, many in the bodybuilding scene sing the praises of processed breakfast cereals instead, and I find rice based ones in particular go down VERY smoothly post workout.  Rice crispies, cocoa crispies, fruity pebbles and cocoa pebbles all make fine choices.  You can put them in a shake and drink them, OR you can pour cereal in a bowl, put protein powder on top, pour milk on it, mix it all together and eat it with a spoon.  Start out with just a cup of breakfast cereal for phase 1.  

**POST WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 2**

* Ok, the cereal is a given now.  Add the fruit to the mix as well.  I liked frozen blueberries myself, but raisins and bananas are a classic staple.  Now we can up the dose of the cereal to 1.5 cups if we like.  I also like to add fat free greek yogurt into the mix at this point OR you could forego the milk entirely and just make it into a parfait with the greek yogurt.  However, if you do that, you need a lot of greek yogurt, because now you‚Äôve taken away from the mixture, and the goal here is calories.  Mixing honey with it never worked for me, so I just take a spoonful or 2 of the stuff with the meal.

**POST WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 3**

* I know we started off wanting simple carbs, but at one point you‚Äôre going through boxes of cereal, so I mix things up at this point and add in a packet of flavored oatmeal into the mix.  Most companies still pack a lot of sugar into their flavored oatmeal, so you still get that, and then the carbs from the oatmeal too.  I don‚Äôt cook it: I just let it settle into the milk/greek yogurt mixture.  Also: whipped cream.  Yeah, I just violated the low fat aspect of this too, but whipped cream is delicious, calorie packed, and really makes the whole mixture very palatable.  The breakfast cereal is at 2 cups at this point, and you still have the fruit and protein powder.  PBFit is a great addition at any point in this process, but now it should DEFINITELY be included, as it‚Äôs yet another way to get in some calories.  At this point, your post workout meal is like a real meal.  That‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôve arrived.

**PRE-WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 1**

* I genuinely don‚Äôt tend to eat a pre-workout meal unless I‚Äôm training first thin in the morning, so simply the inclusion of one is already getting things ‚Äúdirty‚Äù for me.  If I‚Äôm training first thing in the morning, I keep things very light, as I don‚Äôt like to train with a heavy gut.  This morning, I had 2 hardboiled eggs (cage free/organic) and a quarter of a pumpkin spice sour cream donut from Crispie Cream.  I‚Äôm in the VERY early phases of a weight gain cycle right now.  Other times, I‚Äôve done 2 girl scout thin mint cookies, two pieces of toast with a light smear of honey, wild blueberries with honey drizzled on them, etc.  Already, some of that food is in the realm of dirty, but the portion sizes are so small I don‚Äôt swear them.  I just don‚Äôt want to be totally fasted when I lift weights, but I have done it before and didn‚Äôt really suffer.

* Other classics include a protein shake, protein bar, Finibars from Biotest (read my recent entry on Strongman on the Road to see my review on them as a product), or other similar, light items with some protein in them.  

**PRE-WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 2**

* Alright, we‚Äôve knuckled down and the pre-workout meal is now a foregone conclusion: let‚Äôs make it an actual meal.  You can‚Äôt get more classic than a PBJ: a Dan John favorite, and honestly, just a solid choice.  You can go all out and make sure to get the natural peanut butter, Ezekiel bread and sugar free jelly to keep things on the healthier side.  If you prefer to be like me and do the ‚Äúno fats and carbs together‚Äù approach, this is another fine opportunity for stealing from the post workout nutrition.  Cereal and protein powder, greek yogurt and protein powder, a protein shake with some honey toast, etc.  I‚Äôve also been experimenting with a high fat pre-workout meal, typically just heavy servings of nuts/nut betters, to include nut butter sandwiches on low/zero carb bread.  Results have been solid so far.  

**PRE-WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 3**

* Say hello to your friend: the pop-tart.  Now, technically, I‚Äôd be willing to say that ONE pop-tart pre-workout could be skirting the edge of phase 2, but come on: no one eats one pop-tart.  They come in packages of 2: what‚Äôre you supposed to do with the other one?  Put it in a ziplock so it doesn‚Äôt go bad before you get to it again?  We‚Äôre eating both right now.  400 calories put down in seconds.  Tons of sugar and carbs, minimal fat (you can even buy low fat pop-tarts), just the thing to spike your insulin before hitting the weights.  If you want, you can combine pop-tarts with your other pre-workout meal ideas above to REALLY jack up the calories.  Candy bars would work here too, depending on the composition, but I‚Äôd again go for stuff that is mostly carbs rather than heavy in fats.  You‚Äôd skittles would be a good choice, but I find they require a LOT of chewing, and at this point in your bulk, you‚Äôre eating SO much that you wanna keep chewing to a minimum.

**PRE-PRE WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 1**

* Let‚Äôs cop to this now: when you‚Äôre having pre-pre workout meals, you‚Äôre already pretty deep into the bulk.  But if you‚Äôre trying to evolve from clean to fully dirty, you might implement this after phase 1 of the pre and post workout meals, but you could also wait until you reach phase 3 of those to do this.  Adding extra meals is always a viable way to bump up calories.

* In phase 1 of the pre-pre workout, we‚Äôre going to have a regular meal.  I like to just make this leftovers from the previous night‚Äôs dinner.  For me, that ends up being meat and veggies.  For you, maybe that‚Äôs pasta, or some meat with rice and potatoes.  You could also make this a second breakfast, and get some eggs, oatmeal, toast, etc.  Just finding an opportunity to get in a whole other meal is going to go far toward helping gain weight, and those extra calories before a training session are also going to mean you‚Äôll be able to REALLY push training hard.  I‚Äôve observed a direct correlation between how many meals are in me and how hard I can train, even if the time of day remains the same.

**PRE-PRE WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 2**

* Time for a country breakfast.  Get some pancakes, grits/hashbrowns, eggs, bacon, and toast.  Still ‚Äúgood‚Äù food, but a lot of it.  At this point in the diet, I‚Äôm so sick of cooking and cleaning I typically go out for this.  Alternatively, bump up the portions of what you were eating in phase 1.  This is a pretty easy intermediately phase.

**PRE-PRE WORKOUT MEAL: PHASE 3**

* Frozen pizza time.  I was eating the Quest brand frozen pizzas at the time because they were ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù.  Make no mistake: you‚Äôre eating frozen pizza.  It‚Äôs not good for you.  But they‚Äôre stupidly easy to make and a Quest one packs around 700+ calories with a fair amount of protein.  While it cooks, you can watch training videos and get excited for your next session.  Eating one of these a day can get pricey, but that‚Äôs the cost of getting huge, which, at this point in your bulk, is your goal.  I suppose you could also order a real pizza and eat half of it, but frozen was just more convenient for me.  I‚Äôve also made use of fast food drivethroughs at this point (Taco Bell has a fantastic breakfast spread) for a similar end.  Some days, when I was feeling a bit less lazy, I'd do a 1lb+ ribeye steak.  That's anabolic as hell.

aobx24,gainit,Longevity with lifting big: thoughts on maintaining in all ways considered.,"I was at work telling my friend how excited I was to get back into lifting. Hitting the compound lifts, working on form, improving and growing the body.  It truly is exhilarating once you get in the swing of things and start to see results.  

Anyways, as I am telling my friend this (we are both 28 & 30), another guy much older than us in his later 40‚Äôs overhears me talking, and starts to tell me how ‚Äúback in the day, when he was in the Marines, he was lifting hard and drinking 4000 calorie shakes multiple times daily, sitting at 6% body fat and 200lbs‚Äù.  Listening to this exaggeration, I couldn‚Äôt help but 1. ask him to see some pictures of this and 2. Pondered to myself if he had been a member of this sub reading all those shake recipes as of late. LOL

Anyways, details of his past experience aside, he said that when he quit lifting often and went into construction, that he lost all his muscle and his metabolism has never been as fast since.  He also mentioned he got into cycling for some reason acting like I might think that would be a good alternative.  I chuckled inside again.

I‚Äôm 28, 6‚Äô 2‚Äù, 160, so very much a skinny white dude, and was telling my friend that I‚Äôd like to hit 175-185 in the next 2 years, really build out my somewhat tall frame and look balanced for my height (reasonable desire, no?).  The older gentleman overheard this as well, saying that I‚Äôm ‚Äúfine‚Äù the way I am, maybe 5 pounds more would be ok, but no more than that.  Also some weird comment that ‚Äúyour body at your (talking to me) age seems to figure out what it likes to be at.‚Äù

A interesting exchange for sure, but it did get me thinking.  At some point, how hard is it to keep on eating 3-4000 calories a day and keep on building?  Will there be a day, say at 185, when maintaining what I have built is good enough?  What are your guys ideas about nutrition and lifting long term, for general health, longevity, and the like?  Especially how getting a lean body built up and maintaining it has an impact on metabolism, for example.

This guys comments didn‚Äôt dissuade me one bit.  I‚Äôm in it for the long haul as I love to lift, but his point, in essence, is an interesting one to ponder (coming from a guy who was into lifting, and as long been out of it - he was in average shape himself)

1m0rxhw,loseit,Stage 2 update,"Currently I‚Äôm at 271.1(61lbs down). I‚Äôm  1lb away from completing the step 2 portion of my weight loss which is pretty exciting. I was off by about a month and a half but I did have a maintenance month so let‚Äôs say 15 days off lol. Let‚Äôs go over some changes or things I‚Äôve stuck too since the last one:

1. Stats- I haven‚Äôt come close to beating the streak of 53 days without being in a caloric surplus, but that‚Äôs ok. That‚Äôs never my intended goal and life started lifeing itself. I‚Äôm currently 176/196 days in being in a deficit for the year and 215/235 days since the start of my current weightloss push. In 33 weeks, I‚Äôve lost an average of 1.84lbs a week and that includes one maintenance month due to a limited time double job and multiple events. I think I did go perfect in may though lol. Once again, most of the surplus days involved eating with friends, but I have since been able to even manage these days with how the last week went where me and a friend worked the fair and I didn‚Äôt go over once(tons of walking as well).

2.Nutrition- combining 2 and 3 of my last update because it‚Äôs really molded into something where all the food is the same. So, I used to eat breakfast mainly by cooking or a snack here or there or eating out here or there. I‚Äôve since been integrating any type of food into my day to day. Frozen food, eating out, cooking, fruits, veggies, it really doesn‚Äôt matter to me. Carbs especially have gotten consumed more than any other macro and we‚Äôre talking about soda, candy, along with fruit or potatoes. Literally ate a burger, with a soda and a vitamin water, and I‚Äôll probably have a snack later, a game to play, and dinner. I‚Äôll go into why it doesn‚Äôt matter later. My goal here is to take control of all food rather than avoiding something because someone calls it ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. I treat food as ‚Äúlow performance‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh performance‚Äù but even then simple carbs can be a valuable thing for someone heavy in cardio. This is something I will stick to u til my goal changes to eating for fitness reasons rather than weight loss.

3.Exercise- As I said above, exercise I do is all cardio but I could be walking, sprinting, etc. I play a lot of basketball so the high MET is really putting my caloric burn up a ton, especially since I‚Äôm playing for 1-2 hours as a runner. I still have the same knee issue and I‚Äôve even gathered a couple more unique injuries I‚Äôve had to deal with probably from the lack of muscle maybe, but I‚Äôm doing my best to adjust and stay healthy: however, given last weeks deal where I was only able to walk, I feel much more confident I can lose weight without the need for it. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I will start lifting at the 210-230 mark with my brother or my friend so I can really turn the heat up, but for now it‚Äôs just weight loss.

4. Motivation- no real change here. I don‚Äôt need motivation at all, but if I do feel there‚Äôs something off because you know emotions can take over, I always look over my data to keep me focused on the overall progress. I know, it‚Äôs never easy when you see the scale and see it don‚Äôt move, but with each plateau passed, it makes this much more easier the 2nd, 3rd, and so on time.

5. Hunger Levels- anytime I‚Äôve had issue with hunger, it‚Äôs when I don‚Äôt eat periodically enough throughout the day. Mostly happens when I have a pretty heavy breakfast from eating out somewhere cause my fam wants like a breakfast burrito or something like that or my own doing eating too many times before work and having to survive. I do treat it as a warning rather than needing to eat so it‚Äôs pretty easy to ignore it. However, I will just eat something small once every couple hours to manage it mostly in the form of a serving or two.

6- water intake- probably my biggest issue here. Not because I hate water or anything. It just feels like a chore to me lol. I have been trying to get in more and I know I do need it when exercising but just have trouble reminding myself to drink do something. I think Itol be easier when I‚Äôm in the maintaining stage so I‚Äôm not subconsciously worried about the weight since I know it doesn‚Äôt mean anything regarding that.

7-body measurements- my waist has dropped to a fluctuation of 52-50.5. That‚Äôs the only one I really focused on but yeah it‚Äôs about a drop of 4-5.5 inches since the last one. I think my arm dropped 1.5 inches, my leg still looks the same, but maybe there‚Äôs some change there. My neck lost an inch or two. I think I have a pretty good idea about how long it will take for there to be a change in inch, so I can start preparing for what clothes are gonna probably have to go.

8-clothing- which brings me to that. Kinda crazy. I have 114 on my sheet, and only 26 are left that can‚Äôt fit good for normal purposes. I‚Äôve already gotten rid of multiple hoodies, I‚Äôve added about 7-10 shirts to my gym wear, and I‚Äôve modified the ones I was currently wearing. If you have seen my last update, there was this one flannel shirt hoodie I mentioned that I really wanted to fit in and I was shocked that I‚Äôm actually only about 1 inch away from it being a complete comfy fit. I had leave the bottom button off but other than that, loved it. Of course, I‚Äôm looking to fit into the other clothes, but not really sure where to go from there. If my trends are correct, I‚Äôm gonna have more clothes that don‚Äôt fit than clothes that do going the other way which will be bittersweet, but the clothes I like getting will be much more attainable. I really have an issue with shorts because I only have one pair that is pretty small when I get down while the rest of them will make my legs look like toothpicks. Time to look around lol.

9-mindset- this will be a new one I‚Äôm adding, but it will be more or less the same. I‚Äôve now changed my mindset to a longterm life goal of how I want to navigate my body composition for now, later, next 10 years, and life. It could change but the habits I‚Äôve now established will be implemented regardless of the mindset. The mindset being I don‚Äôt take food out of any of my diets unless they don‚Äôt support the goal I‚Äôm planning. So, for losing weight, I don‚Äôt need to take anything out especially with cardio, I just need to shorten serving sizes. Because basketball is prominent in the exercise, I‚Äôm afforded more forgiveness to simple carbs. If I were to take on fitness bodybuilding, I put more emphasis on protein intake and I will probably have to up my serving sizes for ‚Äúbulking stages‚Äù and lower my sizes for ‚Äúcutting stages‚Äù. If I were to get old where high intensity sports become a pastime to me, then I‚Äôll look to eat more clean for the goal of longevity, but that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm gonna operate from now on. As I get used to each stage, it will be clockwork, but the way I eat will stay the same give or take.

So there‚Äôs my update I‚Äôve added a couple changes to my current goals

Stage 1:300lbs‚úÖ

Stage 2:270lbs(1.1lb)

Stage 3:240lbs(31.1lbs) EST:11/25

Stage 4:210-220lb(51.1lbs-61.1lbs) EST:03/26

Stage 5:maintain/optimize fitness(foreseeable future)

Any questions about things I do in detail, you‚Äôll see me in the comments üëçüèæ until the holidays

1kki1nw,loseit,"Milestone #3:  100+ lbs down, no longer obese","For those who haven't seen my previous posts, the short version of my current push is that I started at my highest weight last July, reached 300 pounds last Thanksgiving (milestone #1), 278 which was my previous best weight loss effort in February (#2), and now I'm here.  I have a set of 4 milestones that I've termed the 'Entrance Exam', with the last one being reaching the normal BMI range, aiming for roughly Thanksgiving of this year on that one.  My long-term goal is health and longevity, so reaching at least that point is a key part of it.  

I was very intimidated by this part of the journey before;  concerns about how much my weight loss might have slowed down, loose skin, having to reduce what I eat, etc.  So far I mostly haven't reached those concerns, and also I weirdly don't feel as fantastic about having left obesity for the first time in 28 years as I thought I would.  The main thought in my head right now is 'keep going.  You're not there yet.  Nice hurdle to cross but there's a lot more to be done'.  

I'll be happy to answer any questions, but those who read my postings around here will know that I'm big into sleep, the path of discipline, and the art of Doing It Anyway.  I'll add some thoughts here about listening to your body, as that's been a big theme for me recently.  

**Listening Well**

Last fall and most of the winter, I had an approach of fasting one day a week, for two reasons;  the mental discipline of reminding my body that it would be just fine without food for a while, and it also allowed me to stave off hunger the rest of the week by having a little more to eat on those days while still keeping my overall deficit.  This worked well, until it didn't.  I began to have a lot of trouble sleeping one day every 2nd or 3rd week, which isn't a lot but it was always the night after the fast.  After dealing with this for a while I realized my body didn't like what I was doing, and having worse sleep was a bigger problem than the benefit I was getting.  So now I have a consistent amount of calories each day.  

More recently, I've switched from many small meals throughout the day, you could even call some of them just snacks, to doing a four-meals-a-day routine.  This has been an overall improvement I think, although it's also revealed a hilarious disconnect between body and brain;  my stomach will be full and my brain wants to chow down more, to the point of sometimes even being sad \*while I'm eating\* because after this meal I won't get to eat again for a few more hours.  Anticipatory sadness.  Yep, my brain is broken and the food noise continues.  But it will not defeat me.  

I've been frustrated by injuries;  a nagging knee injury at first, then one just above my left ankle more recently that have limited my ability to exercise as much as I would like.  But I do think I've done pretty well in learning how to 'rehab' these, backing off when the pain reaches a certain point, gradually re-building, and so on.  Giving my body enough stimulus to improve my fitness, but not so much that I exacerbate the injury.  Still learning here, and hoping I can eventually get through these 'what?  We haven't used that in decades.  What are you doing??' moments from my body.  I'm even basically re-learning how to walk, as my feet have always 'leaned inwards' and I think correcting that - though awkward and frustrating - is important to accomplishing my goals.  

**Listening Badly**

A few weeks ago, I had a significant failure of discipline.  I didn't eat a huge amount of calories, maybe 1000 over my typical amount for the day.  Muffin, bread with jelly on it, some extra fruit, etc.  And my oh my did my binge brain make an emergence.  Give it an inch, it'll take ten miles.  The rest of the day it was screaming at me to get and consume virtually every food you can imagine.  Because after being typically very consistent with 'I don't eat it if it's not on the plan', I had given in.  At high difficulty, my internal monologue was basically 'listen here asshole, you have no right to behave this way.  You are still obese.  Grab a mirror if you don't believe me.  Get a grip, or I will go back to the fasting one day a week until you get the memo.  We are moving forward, not backwards.  This insurrection will not be tolerated'.  I kept my protein for the dinner that day because esp. when healing an injury I didn't think it was real wise to skip that, but otherwhise I had a smaller meal, taking a few hundred calories back and essentially turning it into roughly a maintenance day.  The next couple days were close to where I should be but not quite there, after that it was back on the plan entirely.  In the past this episode could well have turned into a weekend-long binge of 10k calories or more over plan, followed by 'eh screw it I'll get back to that sometime', followed by a couple months later 'oh, I've gained back 20 pounds, eh I'll get back to it next week', followed by not getting back to it next week ... you all know the drill.  I've done it.  I wasn't about to do it again.  

**TLDR** The main point I'm trying to make, hopefully in a helpful way, with these examples is that there are times when it's right to listen to your body and times when it isn't.  When it doesn't align with the objective data (i.e. my body wanting more food while losing weight at a healthy pace), tell it to sit down and shut up.  But when something like sleep is being compromised, or an injury situation, or something like that ... yeah it's definitely proper to pay attention.  I'm still learning in this area, but it's been very helpful to me keeping the ship sailing in the right direction.

1jwhz0o,loseit,"I am so proud, I could cry.","I (25F) decided it was time to make a change at the end of 2024. I couldn‚Äôt explain it then, and it‚Äôs hard for me to explain now, but it felt different. On January 2, I wrote myself a note that I keep on my bathroom mirror and read every day:
‚ÄúThis year, I will keep my promise to myself ‚Äî to honor, protect, and love my body in a way that promotes my health and longevity. I am worthy of self love and health. I promise to prioritize my health and happiness by fueling and moving my body in ways that feel right. My body is a temple, and I will treat it as such. Cheers to 2025!‚Äù 

I have been an athlete and extremely active person for my entire life, so it has always been hard for me to conceptualize my weight/health. For example, I ran a marathon in January 2024 when I weighed almost 200 pounds. Because of my success as an athlete, even though I knew I could stand to lose some weight, I was never really serious about it. 

When I started my weight loss journey in December, I was 203-206 depending on the day. Today, I am about 20 pounds down at 186 lbs. I know how big of an accomplishment that is, but I still have my moments where I feel like I haven‚Äôt worked hard enough. 

Now, to my point. I have a concert tomorrow and a party on Saturday, so I decided to try on some outfits. I started to notice my clothes fitting looser, and after trying some things on, I pulled out THAT pair of jeans. You know, the pair that you keep in the back of your closet ‚Äújust in case‚Äù you lose the weight. I looked at them and said out loud ‚Äúthere is no chance these will fit yet.‚Äù To my surprise, THE JEANS FIT!!!! I have not been able to fit in them for three years, and today they zipped without a problem. Last year I couldn‚Äôt even get them over my thighs. I am practically speechless. I don‚Äôt even know what to say, but DAMN, I am so proud of myself. 

Putting on those jeans today was proof and validation of my hard work. For the first time in years, there is concrete evidence that I can do hard things. I truly never thought it was possible. I thought I was destined to be overweight. I‚Äôm not. I don‚Äôt know what else to say besides wow. I am so proud.

I‚Äôm not going to put some excuses or reasons or mention anything about what got me here but here I am.

I‚Äôve decided to change my diet to concentrate mostly on protein and healthy fats, I‚Äôm walking for about 40-50 mins 3/4 times a week and weightlifting for 25 mins 3 times a week too. I‚Äôm trying to eat around 1750 cals or less to lose weight.

Am I doing enough? I struggled with anorexia and bulimia at age 16-20 so I don‚Äôt want to do TOO much if you know what I mean.
Will what I‚Äôm doing have enough of an effect on these stats for me to see an improvement in say 6-8 weeks? 

I feel sad I let myself get here, what else can I do to boost my health and longevity? ",2025-03-18 10:43:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1je213d/advice_and_discussion_welcome/
1j4mbym,loseit,Question about longevity of current diet,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm wondering what some of your thoughts are on my current diet. I‚Äôm trying to eat in a slight calorie deficit while starting to lift weights again after 1.5 years of being sedentary. I‚Äôve been doing this meal plan for 2 weeks and have really been enjoying it.

My diet:
Breakfast - 2 pieces of Dave‚Äôs whole grain toast dry/ two fried eggs cooked with coconut oil/ 1 cup (230g) of low fat cottage cheese with a tablespoon of local honey and cinnamon

Midday - 2 premier protein shakes/ can of sardines OR tuna/ one apple OR orange

Dinner - 8-12 oz steak OR chicken breast / 6 oz of sweet potato / 1-2 servings of broccoli, green beans, OR asparagus

End result is 1700-1900 calories and 180-200g of protein


I actually find it much easier to stay on track when I  have a regularized system like this. Even though I‚Äôm not a picky eater at all, I feel like when I try to mix in too many new foods I‚Äôm having to think/plan too much and it gets exhausting calculating everything. I know gym-goal wise I‚Äôm hitting the mark with calories and protein, but I‚Äôm curious what you guys think about long term nutrition with this plan. I‚Äôm currently 200 and I plan to ride this diet until I‚Äôm around 185, so probably at least 3 months. Any thoughts, tips, adjustments you guys have would be greatly appreciated.",2025-03-06 03:30:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1j4mbym/question_about_longevity_of_current_diet/
1iz147g,loseit,How I lost weight as a 42 year old female,"H: 5'5¬† SW: 191 CW: 166 GW; 160 42F

Just wanted to write on here to see if there are any other ""older"" women like myself that are on this journey.¬† I am a mom of multiple kids and have been reading a lot about how lifting HEAVY is key in for longevity and powering through peri-menopause.

I lost about 20 pounds in 2020 by intermittent fasting and exercising at home, as well as walking 10,000 steps daily. But over time, I slowly gained the weight back and before I knew it, I was back where I stared and then some. Back then, my nutrition was good but I didn't know how important protein was in building muscle and losing weight.

I gave myself 12 months to lose 10 pounds. I was in it for the long haul. I watched what I ate but was ok with occasional treats (as long as I was in my calorie range for the day) and I lost 25 pounds in 15 months.

Here is what I did/am doing:

1. Protein protein protein. I ate 150g of protein daily. I eat yogurt, lots of fish, lots of lean meats, tofu, plant based protein powder with a protein rich snack between lunch and dinner.
2. I lift heavy weights at the gym, 3x week with progressive overload. I work out for 40-45 minutes at the gym, mostly upper body workouts with some leg workouts sprinkled in. My favorite exercises are deadlifts, tricep extensions, chest presses, overhead presses and leg extension machine. I am determined to get some lean arms!
3. I weigh everything I eat on my kitchen scale and log it into my fitness pal.
4. I walk 10,000 to 13,000 steps a day. I allow myself to take breaks but not often. The trail that I walk daily has steep hills, so I get cardio in that way.
5. Fiber. I make sure I get 30g of fiber daily from fruits and vegetables, as well as fermented foods like kefir, pickled cabbage and kimchi.

Observations:

1. The weight loss does NOT move in a straight diagonal line. For the first 3 months, I saw NO change on the scale. It was crazy discouraging. But I kept going because I knew that eventually, what I was doing was going to work. And I was right.
2. People in my life did not notice my weight loss AT ALL until I lost 20 pounds. I assumed that 10 would be noticeable but apparently it is not. And even when they did notice, people would look at me and ask if I got a haircut. LOL. This goes to show that people really don't look you as much as you think they do.
3. My mention of going to the gym or eating more protein immediately makes people feel uncomfortable, as if my taking care of myself is a reflection of the fact that they are not. It makes people feel guilty and they make awkward jokes about how they are couch potatoes. This is really annoying as I am not criticizing them in any way. I stopped talking about my weight loss unless they bring it up.

In any case, I am in the best shape of my life and I plan to continue until I reach 160 which is a number I haven't seen since I was in my early 20's, before I had 3 kids! Don't let anyone tell you that your metabolism is shot after 40. Those are lies!",2025-02-26 23:07:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1iz147g/how_i_lost_weight_as_a_42_year_old_female/

I‚Äôm more concerned about the longevity and how to maintain a program like this. Losing 100lbs seems good in theory but the app is projecting it will take me until the befinning of next year.

Regarding frame size: I measured my wrist and I have a ""large"" frame size. Large is 6.5+ inches in AFAB people, and 7.5+ inches in AMAB people. My (afab) wrist measured with a measuring tape, if pulled so tightly that it can't shrink anymore, is 7.5 inches.

My BMI (current: 42-ish) says I should weigh 118-148lbs. 

I feel like being that small would look very weird on my body. I have a 'brick' body type: imagine a swimmer's body, where shoulders and hips are the same width, and the middle does not dip inward.

How can I figure out how much weight I should lose in order to look good, or do I just have to keep losing until I find it?

Sidenote: I've lost 120lbs already since 2021, I'm just curious about when to stop. I feel better and my body moves well, my sleep apnea and liver disease are gone.

This is at least the 5th time I've made that crossing since first starting to take weight loss serious almost 15 years ago. It would be an insult to yo-yo dieters to call me one; I've had a number of concentrated bursts of success, none lasting as long as six months, with most of that period spent giving up/accepting being an abominably grotesque tub of lard around the 40 BMI range and in recent years even a little higher.

I think complacency is a big factor in what has led to failure in the past.

Eventually typically has been years later when I've regained all the weight.

I've stopped multiple times at about 290, once at 282, and the last time 4-5 years ago my low weight was 278.2. So I'm about 20 pounds away from that, and should reach it before spring if I stick with the program. This time around I have a somewhat different focus; it's about long-term health and longevity for me, so weight loss is just the first part of that; I want to be strong, physically capable, and have good cardiovascular fitness for the rest of my life. I'm doing a significant amount of exercise towards that end, but some of what I would like to do, my body just can't handle yet. I'm rehabbing a knee ligament injury from pushing too hard that reminds me of this. Instead of fitting in health around everything else, this time I'm treating it as my second job. Hobbies etc. take a back seat with whatever time and energy I have left. If that's none, then that's what it is. Failure on my health initiatives is not an option, and so far my 'adherence to the plan' has been almost total, with a few momentary lapses that have been quickly corrected.

I have equal parts apprehension and excitement at the current time; there's a lot of baggage for all the times I've failed in the past at this point. All I've really done so far is get back to the scene of the crime as it were, re-treaded the same pounds that I've lost and gained repeatedly before. My discipline and mental approach is definitely stronger than before; I don't know if it's strong enough. I know in a lot of ways what I've done so far is simply the easy part; weight loss and fitness progress will naturally slow down over time, I haven't had to make significant reductions in what I eat yet, but eventually that will happen (and save money!). I'm concerned about failing - but also about succeeding and how my body will react to potentially reaching weights it hasn't seen in decades.

I guess the main type of advice I'm looking for is just on handling butting up against something that you've repeatedly failed at doing and pushing through. I strongly believe in the power of discipline and relying on that to determine whether I succeed or not, one day at a time ... but I still have the nagging doubt for sure and I've built up a lot of evidence for it.

1gecwmc,loseit,Exercise is essential - why do so many people here dismiss it? ,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, woman, who has lost just over 100lbs (48kgs) and kept it off for five years now. The reason I have been able to keep the weight off for so long is absolutely credited to exercise. 

Firstly, irregardless of weight, exercise is absolutely essential for longevity. Being fat, but fit is shown to be better for you than being slim and lazy. Cardio is for heart health, strength training is for fighting disease. 

Now to talk about weight loss. 

The equation is CICO - exercise is the CO. Yes, you do burn a majority of your calories at rest, but exercise actually makes your resting calories burned increase. The more muscle you have the more calories you burn at rest, because it takes more energy to have muscle than to have fat. Which means even after a weight lifting session where you may have burned less than 100 calories, you‚Äôre going to be burning more just sitting on your ass watching TV than you would if you didn‚Äôt exercise. 

Running and biking are incredibly effective calorie burners. Everyone on here hypes up walking and they should, but if you can switch to a bike or even run, you can burn infinitely more calories than by walking. Walking is great, but it doesn‚Äôt build muscle unless you‚Äôre hiking up hills with packs on. It is still incredible, but it takes a long time and the reward is often minimal for how long it takes. 

One problem with losing weight without exercise is that when you hit plateaus you have to typically cut your calories down again. This is a constant cycle, people talk about being on diets for the rest of their lives here, but it‚Äôs super hard to eat 1400 calories for the rest of your life. With exercise, I can eat 2100 per day and half the time I don‚Äôt even hit that. 

Another issue is that when people shred all their weight just by diet alone they lose fat and muscle. It‚Äôs one of the main reasons we see people hitting their goal weights and while they are skinny, they can be skinny fat. Slim, but still with a higher body fat percentage. Muscle will make you look smaller and healthier. 

Exercise is really hard to get started with. The learning curve is really steep. Once you‚Äôre about six months to a year in, it becomes routine and usually actually becomes fun. It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, just consistent.

I see so many people yo-yo dieting here because they lose the weight by simply eating less and then can‚Äôt maintain the low calories for ever. Those who exercise regularly with intensity are the ones to keep it off long term. It‚Äôs a lifestyle change, not a food change. It‚Äôs changing your sedentary, obesogenic lifestyle, to that of a fit, thin persons lifestyle. Food is just one part of the lifestyle.

1gahi8p,loseit,Exercise vs. Weight Loss: Longevity Studies,"It‚Äôs a common refrain here that diet is more important than exercise, if weight loss is the goal. Unfortunately, that means many people opt to delay starting exercise until they‚Äôre close to their goal weight. 

But studies have shown that when longevity is the goal, exercise is even more important than maintaining a healthy weight. 

> ‚ÄúCompared head-to-head, the magnitude of benefit was far greater from improving fitness than from losing weight,‚Äù Dr. Gaesser said. As a whole, the studies they cite show that sedentary, obese men and women who begin to exercise and improve their fitness can lower their risk of premature death by as much as 30 percent or more, even if their weight does not budge. This improvement generally puts them at lower risk of early death than people who are considered to be of normal weight but out of shape, Dr. Gaesser said.
> On the other hand, if heavy people lose weight by dieting (not illness), their statistical risk of dying young typically drops by about 16 percent, but not in all studies. Some of the research cited in the new review finds that weight loss among obese people does not decrease mortality risks at all.

So alongside changes in diet, it‚Äôs worth it to incorporate exercise a few times a week. Low intensity or high intensity, it all counts.

1g60d0b,loseit,My weight loss journey from engagement to marriage (240ish-170),"Hi everyone, long time lurker.  30M 5'8 SW: 242 lbs, CW: 170 lbs, GW: 155 lbs? 

I've been overweight to obese as long as I could remember, with several diets over the course of 4-6 months  bringing me to just the cusp of healthy weight before inevitably springing back. I proposed to my beautiful girlfriend in May 2023 in Kyoto, Japan, most likely at my absolute highest weight of around 240-250. It had been our dream to visit since prior to pandemic, and I was ecstatic to be there with my loved ones when I proposed. I had been wanting to lose weight on and off for months prior, but with no real progress.


Cue January 2024, I'm still at around 240 lbs, and I finally work up the courage to ask my medical director how he had lost so much weight over the course of a few months. Turns out he had been prescribed on Tirzepatide, (Zepbound) and was raving not only about the weight loss, but all of the additional health benefits that came along with it. He was so ecstatic that he even began studying obesity medicine and planned on opening his own obesity clinic to help others with long-term weight loss.  I volunteered to be his first patient, and the rest is history. 


I'm always open to admitting to others that I have been on weight loss medication, and will freely describe my experience. Under medical supervision, I've been on a very-low-calorie-diet (VLCD) and was advised to meet my minimum protein goals, walk at least 8000 steps per day, and perform weight bearing exercises at least 3x per week. Additionally I've been taking supplements to ensure that my nutritional needs are being met. For the last 9 months I've been steadily losing weight, albeit with a plateau here or there when I lowered my dosage of Zepbound due to the lack of supply. 

I'm proud to say that my health and mental well-being has taken a total 180 since my weight loss journey began. From wearing excessively sized clothes, and avoiding pictures to taking a bachelor's trip to Thailand to get bespoke suits made with my groomsmen. I'm happier overall, and physical fitness and longevity have been my goals that I plan on keeping as I transition to maintenance. I'm happy to say that my strength has minimally declined during the 70 lb weight loss, and through monitoring trends via InBody scans, I've disproportionately maintained lean mass while shedding a great deal of fat during this time. 

We had two ceremonies, an intimate one with close friends and a larger one with additional friends and family. It's actually crazy to finally realize how many people don't recognize you after such a dramatic weight loss when you've been living it every day. I've finally had the courage to go through my old pictures and really take in the details of how I looked before and now. 

https://imgur.com/a/Tp565TP

My hopes are that I slowly reintroduce more calories and stabilize my weight at around 155-160 before performing a bulk and cut cycle. I plan on monitoring my weight daily, count calories, and observe trends. I still have some Tirzepatide that I plan on saving for when I need to course correct and keep me on track if things start to shift upwards. 

If you've made it this far, thanks for listening to my story!

1exppwg,loseit,Low protein?,"This is still a fairly fringe idea in the nutrition world. If you're familiar with Valter Longo and Prolon and the like you might be aware of the supposed longevity benefits of BCAA restriction. Lower protein diets are also much discussed over in r/SaturatedFat.

But in a purely anecdotal sense, i'm curious to know if anyone here has experience with either intentionally or unintentionally reducing protein intake and what the effects were on your weight, body comp, energy, and appetite?

For me personally, reducing my protein intake was an almost magical fix for a lot of problems i was experiencing in terms of energy, blood sugar, and appetite control. It allows me to maintain my weight easily without a crazy deficit. Many people claim to have a reduced appetite when eating high protein, for me it's the total opposite. I overall just feel so much better when i keep to roughly 25g a day.

High protein low calorie diets seem to be effective for weight loss in the short term according to the data, and if you are really trying to preserve or gain muscle then this seems wise. But they have also been shown to potentially reduce metabolism in the long term and activate certain metabolic pathways that can be counter-productive to fat loss and insulin control in certain people - i think it comes down to metabolic health. So if you have dieted for years or are very overweight / obese, it may work well for you if nothing else so far has.

I'm definitely not trying to promote protein restriction flat out though, in fact what works best for me is more of a cycling of HCLFLP with periods of lower carb and higher protein. And whilst i keep protein low, i also have a mostly whole foods plant based diet - i can imagine that a diet high in sugar, fat, and processed carbs, coupled with lower protein, would not be so beneficial. Of course needs vary on a individual basis. 

Anyway, it's not something that is often discussed in the mainstream so just i'm wondering if there is anyone else like me :)

I know cheat days are normal so that you can sustain your eating habits for longevity rather than as a ""diet"", but how do you guys keep yourself from feeling guilty about going over your calorie limit?

1d5hk5b,loseit,The Common Principles of Health - a synthesis of reading 32 different nutrition books and 30 different papers,"Because I am a dork who has been interested in nutrition for years I was curious how much overlap there was between nutrition advice across the medical, scientific, and consumer self-help spectrum. So, I went through and read a whole bunch of books\[1\] on the subject, government guidelines across the globe, as well as a number of scientific articles (meta-analysis, editorials, etc.) and wrote down all the general principles they suggested.

Then I ran that through ChatGPT 4Omni and asked it to give me a list of the most common principles from most-often repeated to least. The answers were... not surprising! Turns out common sense really is common.\[2\] I suspect a lot of people will read these and say ""yeah, no duh"" but it was a fun exercise for me and it increased my confidence in the general intelligence of humanity and the value of the scientific method.

Below is the list of Healthy Habits organized by categories (**Diet Principles, Eating Principles, Living Practices)** and arranged in order from the greatest impact\[3\] to the least. So, if you want to try adopting any of these principles into your life start at the top of each list and work your way down.

# Healthy Diet Principles

* **Focus on Whole, Minimally Processed Foods**
   * Avoid refined carbohydrates and highly processed foods.
      * Getting the majority of your calories in the form of from ultra-refined carbohydrates, fats, proteins has a very different effect on the body than minimally-processed carbohydrates, fats, proteins.
      * After a certain level of refinement the body doesn't like it.
      * Highly-refined calories can be ""hyper-palatable"" and trigger the evolved ""binge response"".
   * If you eat refined foods, choose ones you would have found hundreds of years ago:
      * Masa
      * Stone ground whole grain wheat flour
      * Rolled oats
      * Cheese
      * etc.
   * Cook foods gently to make them more nutritious:
      * Cooked foods are easier to digest (more nutrients absorbed) but too much cooking can destroy heat-sensitive nutrients.
      * Temperature \* Time = Heat-sensitive nutrient loss. Choose fast, gentle cooking methods.
      * Microwaving > Pressure Steaming > Steaming > Pressure Boiling > Boiling > Slow cooking.
   * Avoid or moderate highly calorie-dense and nutrient-poor foods:
      * Oil and sugar have very little in the way of nutrients per calorie.

* **Eliminate or Greatly Reduce Added Sugars and Oils**
   * Use as little added oil as possible to make food taste good. Save the fats in your diet for whole plant foods.
   * Reduce or eliminate added sugars.
* **Eat a Variety of Vegetables**
   * Include vegetables in every meal.
   * Eat a variety of colors every day
      * The different colors (red, orange, yellow, green, purple) all indicate different vitamins and phytonutrients that are beneficial
   * Eat mushrooms, onions, garlic, and greens regularly
   * Make sure you have cruciferous vegetables regularly
* **Limit or Avoid Animal Products**
   * Factory farming is terrible for the environment
      * There are other ways to get the nutrients needed than killing animals
      * The vitamins you think you need from animal products (b12) you can get from plant foods, where the animals get it.
   * If you choose to eat animals consider them a condiment or special occasion food
   * Replacing animal protein with plant protein (legumes for meat) has shown to improve health and longevity
      * Plant proteins are the healthiest
      * Fish proteins are second healthiest
      * Fowl proteins are the third healthiest
      * Red meat proteins (beef, pig, deer, etc.) are the least healthy
   * Most of the longest-lived humans in \[Blue Zones\] eat very little meat
      * e.g. 40g a day average or less
* **Eat Fruits Daily**
   * Include whole fruits in your diet.
   * Avoid dried fruits and fruit juices.
* **Make the Bulk of Your Calories Whole Grains and Starches**
   * Base your diet around filling starches like whole grains, beans, corn, and potatoes.
* **Use Salt and Sugar in Moderation**
   * Reduce salt and sugar during cooking, and apply at the table as needed
   * Salt and sugar crystals that directly touch your tongue are the ones you experience
* **Eat Nuts and Seeds in Moderation**
   * Include nuts and seeds but in moderation.
* **Eat Legumes Daily**
   * Eat beans and pulses daily for protein and extra fiber
   * These are very good for your gut bacteria
* **Include Flax Seeds & Other Seeds Daily**
   * Flax is a great source of plant-based Omega-3 fatty acids
   * Seeds contain all sorts of different antioxidants and phytonutrients as well as healthy fats
* **Use Spices and Herbs for Flavor and Health Benefits**
   * Turmeric, cumin, and garlic all have anti-inflammatory properties
   * Nutritional yeast has health benefits based on their beta glucan content (and are often fortified with B12)
* **Regularly Include Fermented Foods**
   * Kimchi, sauerkraut, pickles, etc. are good for your gut
   * Fermented veggies also are a great way to include salt for flavor while also adding extra health benefits
* **Ensure Adequate Vitamin and Mineral Intake**
   * Consider a multivitamin for insurance
   * Vitamin D is basically required
   * Selenium likely if you're of European descent
   * B12 supplementation if you're a vegan
* **Alcohol in Moderation, If at All**
   * If you do drink, drink socially
   * All the major benefits (antioxidants) you can get from grapes
   * Alcohol is a diuretic‚Äîdrink 1 cup of water for every 1 unit of alcohol to avoid hangovers

# Healthy Eating Principles

* **Eat When Hungry Until Comfortably Full**
   * Listen to your body‚Äôs hunger cues.
   * If you're hungry it's ok to eat.
   * If you *think* you're hungry it's ok to eat
* **Eat Meals Undistracted and Slowly**
   * Focus on eating without distractions.
   * Take time to enjoy your meals.
* **Hydrate Well**
   * Drink plenty of water daily, 2.7-3.7 liters per day
   * Preloading a meal with 1-2 cups of cold water can fill you up faster and increase burn rate of calories
* **Consider Intermittent Fasting**
   * Fasting for at least 12 hours a day has health benefits (this includes sleeping)
   * Fasting more can reduce calorie intake as a side-effect, which could be beneficial if you want to lose weight
   * Listen to your body: Ignoring hunger signals constantly can raise stress hormone levels and potentially reduce beneficial hormone levels (e.g. testosterone)
* **Front-Load Your Calories**
   * Eating more earlier in the day means your body can use those readily-accessible calories for work and play
   * Unused calories near the end of the day tend to get stored (as fat) until needed later

# Healthy Daily Practices

* **Moderate Exercise Regularly**
   * Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily.
      * Moderate means you are breathing harder and faster than you would be walking slowly
   * Incorporate strength training
      * Builds muscle and bone density
      * Do whatever kind you enjoy but body weight exercise (pushups, squats, pullups) is enough for major benefits
   * Incorporate flexibility training
      * Yoga, stretching

Notes:

\[1\] I started by reading through everything at [Red Pen Reviews](https://www.redpenreviews.org/) and then I moved onto the best-seller list for diet and nutrition on the NYT and Amazon.

\[2\] What I did find surprising is how rarely Calorie Counting was mentioned as a healthy habit. It was associated with weight loss in the short term, but most of the meta-analysis showed that over the long term most people gain the weight back so it wasn't considered a ""general solution for health and longevity."" I've excluded it from the list because it was way low down on the list of principles that GPT spit out and because it feels like a thing one can do on top of these habits, but the habits can also be practiced without writing down what you ate and how many calories were in them.

\[3\] I use the term ""impact"" to mean ""basically a lot of studies showed significant and strong evidence in observational cohort metaanalysis that doing this is good for you""",2024-06-01 07:27:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1d5hk5b/the_common_principles_of_health_a_synthesis_of/
1c7pald,loseit,Who are some good fitness influencers to follow that focus on health and longevity?`,"Hello everyone!

My stats:   
Age: 24, Sex: M, Height: 168cm, SW: 105kg CW: 100kg GW: 70kg, SWaist: 50inch GWaist: 32

I recently took hold of my life and started to lose weight. I've been hitting the gym daily and eating at a deficit. I have been following fitness influencers like Jeff Nippard, Mike Israetel, and Layne Norton who are evidence-based and well-educated. But I feel most of their content is geared towards people interested in bodybuilding and sometimes feel their advice maybe a little harder for me to follow. 

Are there any influencers who focus mainly on long-term health and longevity rather than on bodybuilding and purely aesthetic reasons? My goal is not to get jacked, but get lean and toned. To focus on long-term health. I already feel like I've messed up my chances at a long life because of obesity in youth, but I want to make sure that whatever I have left, I'll take good care. 

Are there any influencers who give evidence-based information on health? Anyone who explains strength training and cardio for laymen rather than people who want to maximize muscle growth? 

Please give me suggestions on such content! All suggestions are appreciated!!",2024-04-19 05:44:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1c7pald/who_are_some_good_fitness_influencers_to_follow/
1c0xago,loseit,Sometimes I make sure the first thing I eat is an apple.,"I surprise myself how long I can procrastinate eating the apple and it really sets the tone for the day, dietarily speaking. And by the time I am hungry enough to eat the apple, I truly enjoy eating it.  

It also motivates me to go to bed relatively hungry which is good because the pantry is scared of me right around bedtime. And I personally feel kind of gross if I wake up with a heavy stomach from late night munching.  
I do make sure to get a variety I prefer: fuji, honeycrisp or pink lady and switch it up to make things kinda interesting. Sometimes I even get other fruit but usually just go with apples cause of their price/longevity/portability.

There is something about this that really prevents me from overeating that day. And there are other things like if the apples are starting to go bad it's a reminder that I gotta get back in line and start eating them.

1afiuec,loseit,The sad realization of intake,"I‚Äôve (44/f, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 145) been working out for about a year and a half, maybe a year of it has been consistent. I lift weights 3-4 times per week for at least 60 min, usually more. While I feel physically fantastic and can definitely lift a lot heavier now, I keep gaining weight. I know it‚Äôs not all muscle. I‚Äôve been trying to use myfitnesspal but I always forget to log the little things‚Ä¶.a handful of cashews here, a coffee there‚Ä¶stuff like that. I also eat pretty healthy with almost no processed foods and rarely eat out. 

Yesterday I realized that I am going way over what it says my calorie intake should be, despite eating very healthy. I‚Äôm at about 2000-2200 I would say which it seems is very high. I‚Äôm so sad right now that I feel like I‚Äôm basically staring over. I know that the progress I‚Äôve made lifting isn‚Äôt nothing and I should be proud of what I have done, but I‚Äôm just feeling so discouraged today and needed to shout it to the internet void. I‚Äôm trying to focus on the good things I‚Äôve already done for my body in terms of longevity and overall wellness but I‚Äôm really failing at that today.

Update: Thanks to everyone for the support. I got a DEXA scan today (because I needed to see if I was being crazy) and since my last scan 6 months ago I went from 29.3% body fat to 28.6%. I gained 2.5 lbs of lean mass and lost 0.4lbs of fat. So that‚Äôs basically maintaining and better than nothing. I also am now at 0 lbs of visceral fat.

198g2hy,loseit,My goal for 2024 is to stop being fat but I have a few challenges - any tips?,"As the title reads, my (26M) 2024 goal is to stop being fat. I don't consider myself very unhealthy but I am overweight. 

I used to work out but it was impossible to do so regularly because of my old job - I was a yacht captain and there are no gyms at sea (although it's a physically demanding job and I always ended up losing weight and looking better when at sea). So for about 4 years I worked out for 3-4 months in a row and started looking and feeling better, but everytime I had to stop because of my job. I never reached my goals due to the lack of consistency.

Recently I started a new job and moved to a new city. It's an office job, so I'm not as active as I used to be. I haven't joined a gym yet because the room I rent is temporary and am planning to move into a permanent studio in the next two months - I want fo find a gym close to my future studio and workplace. I play padel every week or two weeks but it's about the only sport I do, other than walking 1h10 everyday (part of my commute, which I enjoy but doesn't count as sport). I want to join a gym and already made a few positive decisions, such as eating less carbs, more veggies and completely cutting out sugar from my diet.

I'll point out some of my challenges and probelms:
1. Motivation - because I worked out but never reached my goals my motivation isn't optimal to be honest. Everytime I dedicated myself to the gym I put in the work but never got to see the results.
2. Nutrition - food is very expensive where I live, especially meat, so I don't think I get the right daily ammount of protein to build muscle and lose fat. I know the basics of nutrition and having a healthy diet but am not that knowledgeable about it.
3. Alcohol - I love drinking (obviously every sailor drinks and don't trust the ones that don't). I am not an alcoholic but I drink a couple of times a week socially and it's really something that I don't want to give up, as it is a way to relax and I live in Europe, so everybody everywhere drinks.

I'm just wondering if anybody had a similar situation to me and how you handled it. I'd also like to ask your advice if you have any: really anything that you think could help me start my journey. My short-term goal is to stop being fat and not feel like a fat, ugly and disgusting piece of shit when I look at myself in the mirror, which happens everyday. My long-term goal is to maintain a lifestyle that is healthy and that promotes longevity, while maintaining a physical aspect that I enjoy seeing myself in.",2024-01-16 22:31:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/198g2hy/my_goal_for_2024_is_to_stop_being_fat_but_i_have/
197orhq,loseit,"Beginning weight loss, need advice","Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôve recently got to a place in my life where I‚Äôve become unhappy with the way I look, the way I feel, and the way I utilize my time. I‚Äôm 23, 5‚Äô6, and about 165 lbs. 

So some backstory: I was really skinny for my whole life until I was about 22, I was at about 110-115 lbs. When I was 21/22, I rapidly gained weight and went from 110-115 to 160lbs. I‚Äôm not sure why this change happened and why it was so fast. I was working as a mover at the time so that increased my appetite I guess. I always ate whatever I wanted, wasn‚Äôt very physically active, and still stayed at that 110-115 range no matter what. I don‚Äôt feel like I changed the way I ate too much, but I guess over time I‚Äôve started eating more and drinking more calories. (sodas really add up, I hadn‚Äôt drank soda much before that point.) 

In the last couple of years, my weight has stagnated at about 160. I‚Äôm unhappy with the way my face and body look now but I know that can get mentally unhealthy quickly so I want to focus more on overall health. I know the way I eat and the fact I‚Äôm not dedicating as much time to moving my body isn‚Äôt great for longevity. I want to lose 20-30lbs and/or improve the way my body looks and the way I feel. 

However, I don‚Äôt know where to start as far as getting into a good routine and making the lifestyle changes I need to make in order to see these changes.

18yghcp,loseit,How do you mentally defeat your junk food additions for good?,"I've tried to lose weight for roughly 25 years, and I'm fat as ever now doing it again.  I know how to lose weight, I just don't have the longevity to see it to the finish line.  What ALWAYS derails me is eating sugar / carbs / junk while dieting.  It's like a mental mind shift when I eat even a little, and pretty soon I'll be gorging myself on it and completely break my diet.  That cyclical nature has led me to believe I have food addictions to junk food, and would do better without any ever again in my life.  The problem is, I live in America, I have kids, if there is some holiday, birthday, school event, or some other celebration to be had, you can guarantee junk food will be there calling my name.  I'm sorry, I'm just not that strong to resist after months of starving my body (mentally) from it.

18v9th9,loseit,Weight Loss Strategies as we Enter 2024,"Hey everyone, I'm new to this sub but I usually frequent r/caliberstrong, r/macrofactor, and r/homegym (at least when it comes to health/fitness/dieting). I wanted to write a post with my experience and strategies while losing about 40 pounds in the past year.

Here's my general WL progress:

October 2022: 246 lbs, 40% BF  
October 2023: 202 lbs, 23% BF

I got a DEXA scan in October 2023 so I know my rough BF%. I used this plus my weight loss to estimate my October 2022 BF%. My goal is about 185 lbs at 12-15% BF, but I won't get there without a ton of hard work and probably 18 more months. Anyway, here are the strategies (not tips and tricks) that I used to lose weight, and also some recommendations:

**Aim for 0.5% - 1.0% BW Loss Per Week**  
If you're 250 lbs, this means 1.25 - 2.50 lbs of weight loss per week, or 5 - 10 lbs of weight loss per month. You can generally make this diet change without putting too much stress on your body and mind. At higher bodyweights, you can probably lose more. At lower bodyweights, you might struggle with the top end and need to focus on 0.5% BW loss per week.

Why is this my recommendation? For one, they're nice even numbers though somewhat arbitrary. The real answer is 0.5% - 1.0% BW reduction per week often leads to a sustainable diet with healthy eating habits. I've generally maintained a good relationship with food over the past year. I'm not afraid to eat out, though I may not drink a ton of beer if my friends want to go to a bar. Maintaining a healthy relationship with food is super important. Losing weight at this rate also *may* improve the odds that you don't need skin loss surgery because you'll lose weight more slowly.

**Start a Resistance Training Program**  
You don't need to start a bodybuilding or powerlifting program. But try and go to the gym 2-3x per week and lift for 30-60 minutes. Do a full-body session. Don't push particularly hard (unless you've been lifting for awhile). When you lose weight, there's a potential for muscle loss. Lifting weights helps reduce muscle loss. You may also develop muscles you've never used before which can help with back aches, as an example.

Finally, lifting weights can help you burn extra calories, though it's probably way less than you think. I estimate each of my 60-minute gym sessions burns 200 calories.

**Be Very Sensitive to Diet Fatigue**  
Diet fatigue is simply the mental and physical effects of dieting, often negative (of course there are positive effects as well, but that's not fatigue). Each person experiences diet fatigue differently, from what the symptoms are, to their magnitude, to how quickly, etc. For me personally, after 7-9 weeks, my diet fatigue gets really bad and I need to take a maintenance break. Here are my diet fatigue symptoms:

1. Fixation on food - I'm always thinking about food, no matter what time of day
2. I'm always hungry - I could have a 5,000+ calorie cheat day and still feel hungry
3. Trouble sleeping - I can't sleep because I'm hungry

As you are dieting, note your diet fatigue symptoms and plan accordingly. There's nothing wrong with dieting for say 3-4 months (and losing 6.5 - 13% of your BW) and then spending 1-2 months at ""maintenance"" (eat at your TDEE, or total daily energy expenditure to neither gain nor lose weight). This can help reduce diet fatigue so you can execute another fat loss phase.

In addition, if you've been dieting for 3+ months and you aren't losing weight like you used to, you feel like you're doing everything perfectly and it's gotten harder, or you're just miserable, you might want to take a maintenance break. As you lose weight, your TDEE may decrease due to reduction in NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) - this could be a 50 calorie impact, it could be as high as 350 calories depending on the individual.

Maintenance breaks will eliminate your diet fatigue and can often get your TDEE back to ""healthy"" levels. My TDEE is usually 2850 - 3000 calories/day. When I'm deep in the diet, it will drop to 2650 - 2750. To maintain my expected rate of weight loss, that means I need to drop calories by 200 - 350 per day, or add more LISS (low impact steady state) cardio (e.g., walking). Combine working harder with diet fatigue, and losing weight can become impossible.

**Pay Attention to Activity/Workout Signals and Systemic Fatigue**  
This section is for those people who are doing a lot of high intensity cardio (like running) or weight lifting. Pay attention to your systemic fatigue. Systemic fatigue is overall fatigue that you feel while doing these activities, usually tiredness but also joint aches and sometimes mental disposition.

Everyone at some point or another will experience systemic fatigue when running a weightlifting program (otherwise you could push hard everyday for eternity and become infinitely strong). The best example of systemic fatigue is actually from my lower body workout this week. I was doing 3 sets of barbell squats and I failed the last rep in the last set (due to muscle failure). Pushing a heavy compound lift to failure generates a ton of systemic fatigue. A day later, my entire body is completely wiped out. Unloading the dishwasher was super tiring. That was Friday, now its Sunday and I feel about 90% better. 

Basically listen to your body. If you're running and your knees hurt, take a break from running or get a coach. If you're lifting and you cannot progress your lifts anymore, or you're extremely tired in unexpected areas (e.g., doing a chest workout and your legs get tired), it's time to take it easy for a week or two and recover. This is important for longevity.

I forgot who said it, but today's workout is 50% focused on the lifts, and 50% focused on tomorrows workout. That's how you develop consistency, and consistency is how you make progress (the same goes for dieting).

**Use an App/Tracker to Help**  
I used MyFitnessPal for awhile with success. I've also used Chronometer when I ran Keto (I don't recommend it, my fasted blood sugar levels dropped to 46). Now I use MacroFactor. It doesn't yell at me if I overeat. It also does its best to estimate your TDEE over time so you can adjust your caloric intake. I also use Caliber to track my workout progress.

Anyway, that's it. Hope this helps people. If you want to see more about my progress, I recently posted a 1-year WL update, just check out my account profile. Happy to answer any questions people have.

16blutl,loseit,Should I move to maintenance or keep cracking on?,"[https://imgur.com/RCTEO2M](https://imgur.com/RCTEO2M)

&#x200B;

As can be seen from the MFP graph my weight has yoyoed over the last 10 years, with a notable crescendo in Covid. With my recent efforts I'm now approaching my goal weight, (72kg - which is the top end of ""healthy"" BMI for a 170cm / 5'7"" woman). I am really pleased. I don't want to understate this. It's a dream. I have been literally weeping when I've been able to get back into beloved old favourite clothes which I've not been able to get into for 5 years. I can run again, the dreaded chub rub has decreased, I've stopped snoring, the compliments have been off the hook. 

All that said, I'm still a little fluffy, especially in the tummy. I think that another 3kg (i.e. 69kg) would get me the look I would like, especially as I'll run a powerbuilding programme. It's still a healthy weight, I don't think it's even approaching too skinny which is not the aesthetic I'm into anyway. However, I don't want to do what I've always done before though, and just shoot back up as soon as I take my eye off the ball. 

I remember reading somewhere that the most effective way to maintain is to lost 10% then maintain for a year, then lose another 10%. I'll have lost more like 17/18% at 72kg. Does anyone have any experience of maintenance strategies? Or strategies for longevity? Should I stick with my original (stretch) goal and maintain it for a while before re-appraising? Should I just shoot for 69kg and then maintain? I'm quite good at losing weight but it's the keeping it off that actually matters in the long run. I would add that the weight loss was a bit urgent as I trained for a through hike and carrying 10kg less of my own weight is massively significant, but that urgency has gone. I've averaged a rate of about 0.5kg/week since March. 

\[Addendum to make the post more useful - How I've done it: Basically I've taken the advice on the subreddit. I've tracked calories - bought a year's subscription to MacroFactor (and listened to a lot of Stronger by Science podcasts). I eat as much protein as I can, and loads of vegetables. I prepare my own protein rich overnight oats rather than doing hotel breakfasts. I repeat quite a lot of the same meals over and over. I've stopped baking all the goddamn sourdough that I did during lockdown. I've done the Paul McKenna 'I can make you thin' hypnosis and repeat it regularly (it's actually quite good). I have cut down but not cut out booze, and I allow myself blow outs (e.g. a festival or wedding) and as many days as I need off tracking to stay sane. I took up trail running, did a 700km + through hike and I've done weights (with a focus on the power lifts) for a while. I use huel hot and savoury for lunches so I don't spend ¬£20 on a calorie feast. I weigh myself almost every day.\]",2023-09-06 14:32:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/16blutl/should_i_move_to_maintenance_or_keep_cracking_on/
14klcdy,loseit,"Celebrating achieving the lowest weight I‚Äôve been in over 10 years, reaching Onederland, and getting closer to my goals üéâ‚ú®üéä","On the top of the combined screenshot is my MFP progress graph from the start of my current weight loss journey, and on the bottom is the graph with all the data MFP had. It goes back to May 2013, but I used MFP before this, even back in high school, but that data is gone for whatever reason, but I digress.

You may wonder, ‚ÄúWhy were you weighing yourself and logging it so frequently if your weight just kept going up?‚Äù The answer is because despite all the challenges I‚Äôve faced in life, some part of me is still an eternal optimist and always believed that ‚ÄúToday is the day I take control of my weight, and get serious about weight loss‚Äù, so most of those were either ‚ÄúDay 1 of weight loss‚Äù measurements, or follow-on measurements of short-lived weight loss journeys that usually lasted about a week or so. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt know the number of weight loss journeys I‚Äôve been on at this point, it‚Äôs probably dozens. I‚Äôve either been on one, or taking a break since senior year of high school, but I am happy to say that come hell or high water, this will be the last. When I do ultimately reach my goal of ~10% body fat, I‚Äôll switch to maintenance, and plan to still track calories, weigh myself regularly but less often probably.

More details for the curious, but there were 2 ‚Äúphases‚Äù. The first was last June when I attempted a version of One Meal A Day, and achieved about 10 lbs of weight loss. I wasn‚Äôt calorie counting though, fell off the wagon, and eventually gained back about 5 lbs.

The second phase is when I read about the Mediterranean Diet and the decades of research (since the 60‚Äôs!) showing how beneficial it is in various ways. Fun fact, it isn‚Äôt a weight loss diet (though most people do lose some weight) but a longevity and heart/overall health diet originally based off the traditional diet of Crete. Also it‚Äôs very flexible for different cuisines and palates, which is why I see myself sticking with it in the long term. Since the MD isn‚Äôt a weight loss diet, I had to count calories, no surprise there. My goal has been 2 lbs per week of weight loss. Food scales have been SO helpful with this btw.

For those who looked closely, the graph is very spiky because I weigh myself (nearly) everyday. That‚Äôs what works for me, but everyone‚Äôs got a different rhythm that works for them. Also there‚Äôs a couple of places where my weight drops quickly in the graph and then plateaus for a bit, and that is because I got sick a few times over the last year. Idk the mechanisms involved, but it all seemed to even out to about 2 lbs a week of weight loss in the end so.. ü§∑

Stats and goals:
- 6‚Äô5 (195 cm), 34 yr old man
- SW: 265 lbs (120.2 kg)
- CW: 198.4 lbs (90 kg), 19.4% bf per bathroom scale, 16.6% per calipers (I‚Äôll get a more accurate estimate next week at a fitness assessment in my gym)
- GW: ~10% body fat, not a specific weight.

But first I want to know why I personally need to lift weights and burn more calories daily if I don't want to have muscle in my body. I just want to be extremely thin. I know lifting makes certain people look very thin and nonmuscular, but can't you achieve that same thing with cardio? Just wondering.

Also, I have heard there are longevity benefits to lifting, plus a bunch of other stuff. Lifting prevents injuries and such because one is actually becoming stronger. But do people like me actually need it? I'm 31, male, 5' 11"", and 315 pounds.

144lwns,loseit,Fasting regiment and supplements that wont break fast,"Dear Reddit,   
I have made the decision to adopt a daily intermittent fasting regimen, only eating from 12-6pm, with the objective of promoting both physical and mental longevity. As part of this practice, I intend to incorporate various supplements and compounds into my routine.   
Therefore, I am seeking recommendations on the optimal timing for consuming these supplements, as I want to avoid disrupting the fasting (ketosis) state. Ideally id take everything in the morning, prior to any food consumption. Hence, I am posting this inquiry to seek guidance...   
Idea for morning routine-  
\- 1 tbsp lemon juice  
\- 2 tbsp Apple cider viniger  
\- Mushroom complex (lions main, turkey tail, chaga, ect.) pill  
\- Turmeric pill  
\- Fish oil pill  
\- Molecular Hydrogen pill  
\- Resveratrol powder 250mg  
\- Celtic Sea Salt (just a pinch)  
Other supplements I want to take daily-  
\- Shilajit pill  
\- Magnesium Glycinate pill  
Other supplements I want to take sometimes-  
\- Maybe Ashwogonda ( in 1 week cycles once every month or 2)  
\- Alpha brain nootropic (once every 3 days or so)   
\- Beet root powder - (4 days a week - B4 physical activity)  
\- Glycerol Monostearate (4 days a week - B4 physical activity)  
\- L-Citrulline DL-Malate (4 days a week - B4 physical activity)  
Other compounds I want to have most everyday-  
\- Black coffee  
\- Lemon balm herbal tea  
\- Santa cruz paleo electrolytes - mixed with water  
\- Athletic Greens powder - mixed with water  
\- Olive oil for the Oleic acid (hopefully get from food though   
Questions:  
\#1- I want to know which of these supplements / compounds specifically aid the fast if taken in the morning when i wake up on a empty stomach but also wont break the fast as of course as im not eating for 5 hours after waking up?(does my idea for best morning routine look right?)   
\#2- If I wanted too could i take all of these at once when I wake up in the morning again on an empty stomach, is that okay?  
\#3- What is the best time to take all of these compounds? I will either get physical activity from 9-10am ( I wake up at 7am) but much more often 6-8pm and I like to eat after which makes the fasting harder, my first meal is from 12-3pm depending on if im going to have a late workout or not. I would love to get an optimal plan for how to take all of these most everyday.  
\#4- Is there anyway to test if I have broken my fast? I could do a trial on myself by ingesting a number of these compounds and then test to see if im still in ketosis (fasting state) or not.  
\#5- Am I being redundant by taking all of these compounds, which should I cut out? Which are the most important?  
\#6- Any supplement or compound recommendations along these lines?  
\#7- Am I hurting myself by starting to take these supplements at my age of 21? Which supplements would I build a tolerance too and should wait to start taking until im older?  
Final thoughts-  
I know this is probably overkill but I want to live a long healthy life and am a big fan of Andrew Huberman (I discovered a majority of these through his podcast). Please let me know any thoughts im optimistic to all opinions and would love to get any information you are willing to add.

zjyh0l,loseit,"The whole ""you can't outrun a bad diet"" meme kept me obese for longer than I needed to be.","I've been struggling with being overweight my whole life. I had a horrendous diet as a child, with fun markers like childhood elevated cholesterol, which carried over to adulthood. Videos [like this one](https://youtu.be/eXTiiz99p9o) convinced me that exercise is a non-factor in weight loss. In fitness meme terms, ""abs are made in the kitchen."" And it's not like I was a stranger to exercise; I was momentarily fit in the latter half of high school, until my mental illness kicked in and I basically stayed fat for all of my 20s. 

Then I listened to a Peter Attia podcast, first with Andrew Huberman (on Huberman's podcast) and then with Inigo San-Millan (on Attia's podcast). Those conversations convinced me that at the very least, exercise is a very important contributor to health and longevity. I had already lost 15 pounds at this point, but it was slow and painful, with lots of cravings and psychological resistance. But then I started exercising with zone 2 cardio (good rule of thumb to know if you're in zone 2: you can hold a conversation on the phone the entire time, but the person you're speaking with would know you're exercising) and slowly but surely, a couple of important things happened. One, I felt like I could sustain this exercise because it didn't feel too taxing. It didn't feel like torture. I started off with speedwalking for an hour, and after a few weeks that wasn't enough to keep me in zone 2 anymore, so I started intermittently jogging and stopping when my exertion level got to be too high. Now, I've gotten fit enough to jog the entire hour. It's slow jogging, and it took me months to get here, but it's jogging.

The second thing zone 2 did for me is magically (from my POV) improve my relationship with food. I don't know the science behind this; I'm sure it's a complex interplay of countless biological mechanisms... or something. But I'm at a point where 1) I obsess about food MUCH less, 2) I'm consistently less hungry, and 3) it's easier for me to resist temptation, i.e. it requires less psychological force to stop myself from eating unhealthy. These are HUGE. CICO still applies, but the perceived exertion needed to control your calories are world's apart. It's not like this is a cakewalk or anything; I still need to apply some discipline. But I feel like it's a reasonable amount of discipline that I can achieve. I'm as certain as I can be that the exercise did this; I've been struggling with cravings my entire life and only once I started a consistent, ""high dose"" of exercise (5 hours a week, i.e. 5 one-hour days) did I notice anything like this. 

I don't remember exactly when my weight loss journey started, so I can't tell you how long this took me. I've been dealing with grief from the loss of my father for the last two years and so my brain and memory are in dire straits. But I've lost 55 pounds. I still have 70 pounds to go until I reach my goal weight, and I'm taking it VERY slowly now (out of concern that losing too quickly will lower my metabolism; [this is the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiYJW9pViaM) that informed my thinking on this), but for the first time in my life I'm confident that I'll get there eventually as long as I keep up with the exercise.

Sometimes, I increase my non-exercise movement, and I notice that the pounds come off even faster if I don't increase food intake. [This is the video](https://youtu.be/RHY4Szl3usM) that informed my thinking on that. But I won't get too much into this, as it's just to increase the calories out part of the equation, and I find all the benefits I've mentioned still apply when I don't move around throughout the day.

I hope this post sparks some ideas in people struggling to lose weight and in need of new strategies. I can't *guarantee* that this will work, but I know it worked for me. Your body is a complex system, and the CICO mantra is technically true but a vast oversimplification from a behavioral prescription standpoint. Getting better (and consistently timed) sleep, lots of light during the day and very little at night should also theoretically help. Pure willpower is nice, but making non-dietary lifestyle changes like exercise and better sleep will ensure your body is working better so that it's not begging for more food as a way to make up for the lost energy caused by stressed.",2022-12-12 13:01:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/zjyh0l/the_whole_you_cant_outrun_a_bad_diet_meme_kept_me/

yfwg10,loseit,I lost 65 pounds 6 years ago and I have kept it off with minimal effort. Here's what I've learned,"Currently, I am a 33F about 5'7 (170 cm), and 122-125 pounds (55-56kg). I was always overweight as a child and into my early 20s. My mother was big on sweets and desserts, and that translated into my adult dietary habits. In college, I became interested in ""anti-aging"" and did research on AGEs (kudos if you know what that is :D ). I made some lifestyle changes that I still follow to this day and as a result, I lost 65 pounds and have kept it off. I'd like to share these tips, in hopes that others who are interested in losing a few pounds may find some ideas. While these tips are purely anecdotal, many if not all of the ideas I got from some research done somewhere. Please be skeptical and do your own personal research as well. 

I would like to point out that I have always been pretty active and was probably more active in my early 20s (while I was at my heaviest) due to having a lot of free time. I truly believe that the weight loss was solely due to dietary changes and was independent of my activity levels. 

&#x200B;

1. I stop eating/drinking alcohol after 8 pm (2000).  This is probably the one rule I am MOST strict about. What do I do if I am at a party or late-night social event? Drink alcohol beforehand and then seltzer water after 8.
2. With rare exceptions, I am asleep by 9 pm (2100) on weekdays and 11 pm (2300) on the weekends.
3. No snacking. Just 3 solid meals a day. Occasionally 2 meals if I am very busy.
4. I eat vegetables/fruit with every meal. Yes, even breakfast.
5. If I have a sweet tooth and want dessert, I eat it directly after dinner, no waiting. With that being said, I rarely eat sugar during the week, maybe a sweet on the weekend. I do try and eat ""sugar-free"" options if possible or just ""kill"" the sweet tooth with fruit instead. (the whole AGEs thing really plays in here if you know what I mean)
6. The only oils I use are butter/ghee or unheated olive or sesame oil. No other veggie oils and I definitely do not heat veggie oils. 
7. While I personally do not count calories or carbs, I try my absolute best to not eat anything with added sugar.  Even at restaurants, I avoid things that I know are loaded with sugar (for example teriyaki sauce or BBQ) 
8. I generally only drink black coffee, tea, water, and occasional wine or cider on the weekends. May some kombucha if it's available. I almost never drink juice/protein shakes/energy drinks.

Good luck to everyone on their journey! And don't think too much about it. It takes time. It took me about a year to lose all of the weight.

y0z39d,loseit,Advice regarding nutritionist directive / current dieting situation,"Hello folks of lose it!   


I wasn't really sure how to title my post so I'm hopeful some kind people will wander in and offer their own takes regardless.   


I started visiting a local nutritionist here in town close to a month ago because I finally decided to get serious about shedding the extra weight. I was a bit skeptical as my search for any form of nutritionist popped up with apps, remote weight-loss instructors and in person clinics. During my first visit I left very reassured that this was the plan that was finally going to start cutting the weight and so far, so good.   


I did my very first weigh in at exactly 349 lbs (158.3 kg). I was given nutritional advice, a prescription medicine (overseen by MD in clinic, rather not name medication as to not endorse) and LipoPlus injections that I have been taking once every other day. I am scheduled for my fourth weigh in tomorrow but as of yesterday on my at home scale I weighed in at 323 lbs (146.5 kg) which is very promising considering where I started. Any loss is incredible, and I'm very happy with the drop, but I know the early decrease is expected and now comes the real grind. I have my concerns though, as I'll list below.   


The medication has worked wonders to help with my biggest enemy: appetite. So much so that I feel in the long run I may cause myself issues. This is more so where I'm in need of other people's opinions/advice.   


The nutritionist set me at a strict 1,800 calorie limit daily, with a very high priority on protein intake. Knowing my previous limits were in the ranges of 2,300-2,500 I assumed for this to be an insane cut and something I would never be able to maintain. With some assistance, I was dead wrong. I have been having trouble reaching the 1,800 mark even with most days going roughly over the 900-1,000 calorie range with the occasional bump to 1,200-1,400. I could be overthinking but could this impact the longevity of loss? Will my body begin to counteract and conserve harder as a result of being that low on my calorie number?   


Apologies for the long post! A lot of curiosity has gone into this concern and I'm just pondering how much success I will have in the long run if I continue to run such large calorie deficits.

Your knees have an expiration date. If you go running while very overweight you are reducing their longevity by a LOT. You might not feel pain now, but you will later.

You are better off walking or going on a stationary bike. Remember that the added weight your knees have had to carry for years has already damaged them, but the jarring impact of running is much, much worse.

For people that have been strength training for many years, how are you all keeping up with progressive overload throughout the whole time? I feel like I've been doing a good amount increasing my weights or my reps each week but I genuinely cannot fathom how over the years it will continue up?

1hvy67y,xxfitness,Very specific question comparing two programs/apps created by physical therapists. ,"I made a different post a couple weeks ago but have had trouble finding reviews/info that aren‚Äôt affiliated with these apps. 

I‚Äôm trying to choose between which program to follow for a bit - Evlo Fitness and Loa Movement. I‚Äôm doing the month free trial of each right now (doing a week of Loa this week then a week of Evlo next) to compare the workouts but I‚Äôm wondering about the differences in their methodology/programming. 

They seem quite similar to me in that they both program a lot of isometric/isolation moves rather than the traditional big lifts and incorporate some mobility into each strength workout. Loa touts longevity & fitness for life while Evlo talks about ‚Äúgentle‚Äù consistently and building muscle/body recomp. Evlo instructors say to do the moves until muscle failure. So far, on the Loa workouts she just instructs to do them for the given time frame (a minute I think normally).

The Evlo marketing appeals to me a bit more as I was to consistently strength train and build muscle but the pricing is what is really holding me off. Loa is more affordable but incorporates a little more rehabilitative and mobility work in the classes I‚Äôve taken so far. I‚Äôm wondering if the differences in programming will affect progress towards muscle growth. Mobility is also important to me. 

Both programs seem joint friendly, educate on biomechanics, and have similarly timed workouts (30min). I haven‚Äôt completed a full week of Loa yet so I haven‚Äôt taken every class format, but I do like the incorporation of Barre and hiit cardio classes on Evlo since I don‚Äôt have a cardio machine other than a basic walking pad at home and weather doesn‚Äôt always permit outdoor cardio. Loa has weekly written interval workouts to be applied to running/biking/etc. 

Has anyone with more knowledge than me have experience with both or either of these programs/apps? I think the price is what is really holding me back from choosing, but given I don‚Äôt have any other fitness related costs at the moment, I‚Äôll pay for whichever I‚Äôll stick with and make the most progress on.

There are a few free (or free version) apps I use for fitness/wellness:
- Fitnotes - android only, tracks lifts and gives stats
- Caliber - strength tracker, spits out free programs, nice explanations and demonstrations of movements, full version is paid but the free isn't too bad for lifting program generation. It's the only one I've found that considers that home gyms may not have a squat rack.
- Medito - free mindfulness app, but they keep it short (5-10min mostly) for better/worse (also seems like they're running into funding issues which may impact the app's longevity, which is unfortunate!)

Then there are a few paid (mostly during sales and some I've been grandfathered in at an old rate):
- Downdog Suite - $22 ish CAD annually, mostly for yoga (I think it's closer to $60 now), though they also have meditation, HIIT, and pre-natal apps included 
- GOWoD - $110 CAD annually mobility and stretching, bit more targeted than Downdog Yoga and great for averting injuries. Hoping with the new updates I may be able to use Downdog full time instead of both (I think closer to $160 without a discount)
- Happier (previously 10% Happier) - $150ish CAD annually mindfulness app, mostly to help pain management and motivation. Have tried a bunch of others, but find this the most similar to an in person practice/teacher led practice, but it is $$$ (closer to $180 without the discount)

So about $282 annually or $23.50/month. Again, fitness alone! 

That's just this year and excludes the apps and programs I've tried in the past. I have a home gym (barbell, bench, and adjustable dumbbells) so I consider it a replacement of gym and studio fees.

What apps have been most helpful for you? (I realize some may see it as a crutch - do you in that case! This conversation is about helpful apps.)",2025-01-03 15:03:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1hsoezg/what_apps_do_you_use_to_support_your_fitness/
1hh1aee,xxfitness,Strength training with focus on feeling good?,"Hi!

I'm a 27-year-old woman. I did CrossFit for a couple of years but I found it way too strenuous and high intensity for me. I never enjoyed beating myself up in the exhausting HIIT exercises and learning the harder movements would have required way more training than my usual 3 times a week. It was too much for me, especially when I'm prone to anxiety and sympathetic nervous system overactivation - when a period of anxiety hit, I had to give up training. Competition/trying to out-do myself has never been a source of motivation for me.

However, I liked the strength training and functionality, and loved the variety CrossFit could offer. I also enjoy zone 2-3 cardio every now and then. I would love to keep working out but at a lower intensity level. I don't have goals regarding strength or appearance, I just want to make my body feel good, support my health, and have fun exercising. Most of all, I want something that has longevity for me.

I have tried mat pilates (my town doesn't offer reformer pilates) and yoga. I like them as supplemental exercises and love the aspect of mobility training but I'd like my ""main thing"" to include more elements from strength training/functional training. 

Could you recommend some programs or coaches  that offer training programs that are focused on well-being, low-intensity workouts and the joy of exercising? 

My ideal routine would include some weights combined with some mobility work and maybe some low intensity cardio.  As I described earlier, I‚Äôm not looking for quick improvement, becoming fittest on earth or challenging myself every day. (I love my comfort zone hahah!) I simply want to feel good training and not to overwhelm my nervous system.

Scaling down the CrossFit exercises is not the option I'm looking for. The workouts are designed to be high intensity, so it feels stupid to take up space from the WOD and then do something that completely misses the point of the workout.

So far I‚Äôm not enjoying the physical process of working out. It all feels so‚Ä¶ uncomfortable? I don‚Äôt like feeling out of breath. That feeling of weakness and struggle when your muscles are starting to fatigue. The lack of coordination. The constant stream of mental chatter policing my own form and technique and correctness. 

I think all of this makes me give up sooner than I could otherwise push myself. 

I guess I‚Äôd like to hear if this is where everyone starts. Is this a normal part of the journey?

I've had a fitbit charge 2 for years which has served me well! But am looking to update my fitness tracking a bit to something more reliable.

I've been looking at Garmin watches as I can get a 15% discount off some of them with my work and frankly I'm quite overwhelmed. 

I want:
- something that'd help me train for a half marathon in the future
- something that can help me track the following activities that I do; running, weight lifting, bouldering, skating, dance, pool swimming, jump rope..
- reliable HR and other health metric tracking
- something that can fit on my quite small wrists
- doesn't look ugly üíÄ
- Good battery life (my charge 2 now requires charging every other day)
- Good compatibility with my Android phone

I don't need:
- A smartwatch
- overly complex metrics for recovery
- something for people who are consistently training for intense races
- music storage 

I really don't know if it's worth moving from Fitbit to Garmin. If I'm investing that much into a watch, I'd want it to be worth my money though and last me years! While I've had good experience with my fitbit I've read quite poor reviews on the later models longevity, and good things about Garmin.

**1) Exerpeutic Folding Magnetic Upright Bike**

I like this one as it folds up for storage.  I would put whatever machine I buy in my garage. I have a storage closet in my garage that this could easily store in.  The other two machines would not fit.  Looks like I can get one on ebay for $90.

**2) Sunny Health & Fitness Indoor Exercise Stationary Bike**

Traditional home exercise bike, I guess. I've read some good things about this brand. Looks like I can get one on ebay for around $150.

**3) Marcy Recumbent Exercise Bike with Resistance**

I like this one the best, it seems like a recumbent would be the most comfortable for longer workouts? Looks like I can get one on ebay for $135.

lqt3u1,xxfitness,How many minutes per a week do you exercise?,"Because quantifiable goals help me stay focused, I log time spent exercising (a mix of cardio & weight training). This helps motivate me to get up and move on days I feel unmotivated. I have a long-term goal I set of 10,000 minutes in a certain number of weeks, based on data connected to exercise & longevity.

cyxdbh,xxfitness,How do I do the thing? (the thing being cross-training),"Hi everyone, really excited to be here and to see such a welcoming community! I have a question about cross-training, but here's a quick summary of where I'm at:

I have exercised all my life, but my favourite form of exercise, muay thai, has become unsustainable due to a chronic illness which causes fatigue, and due to time constraints (each class is an hour and a half, and the gym is half an hour away from me). Even in muay thai, the things I struggled with the most was having the stamina for the exercise. There was running, but it was of the ""come at 6am with running shoes and we'll all do a 5k"" variety, which I really can't do. This and other things led me to not working out for a couple of years except walking and biking for fun/errands. I knew I had a problem when I was getting out of breath walking up stairs.

I recently started running at local gym that's a 5 minute walk away. I'm starting week 4 of C25K, and definitely feeling the difference! I usually get winded very easily on the bike, but I biked for 2.5 hours yesterday and I was fine, and wasn't out of breath when going up hills.

I also started weightlifting to cross-train, and have been going to the gym for an hour/hour and a half/two hours - a run or the GZCLP program, and a long yoga stretch. It really feels like play, I'm enoying it a lot. I alternate running and lifting days. I'm also a total lifting newb, just recently deadlifted 60 pounds and really felt it in my lower back and backs of legs, so will look at that Alan Thrall form video since I know I'm not doing it right. I've read other deadlifting questions so I get the sense of what I should be doing but for safety, I will probably postpone deadlifts until I can work with a trainer. 

My question is: on days when I'm doing the GZCLP program, which doesn't take more than 30 minutes, am I supposed to be doing something else? I'm doing just the exercises he lists in the program (3 a day, 3-4 times a week) and starting with the weights I can lift right now. I haven't done any weight increases or anything like that. I also want to do what C25K says re: giving yourself a day off, so I don't want to run on lifting days.

And finally, I'm very much mindful of (1) not overworking myself, having come from a long time of not working out at all, and (2) not starting everything at once and getting overwhelmed and quitting. I'm really interested in longevity and sustainability of working out. I'm definitely going to take 1 rest day a week.

cfibbf,xxfitness,Should I try to get more flexible first?,"I'm a stiff, unathletic, thin-but-flabby stay at home mom and id like to get in shape for health and longevity reasons. Luckily in my city, there's a fitness program (aerobics, circuit, etc) for moms and babies I can attend. 

The problem is I'm extremely inflexible (have always been) so I can't do many of the exercises properly. For example, I'm so inflexible I can't even sit up straight with my legs in front of me (90¬∞). I can only sit with a straight back if my knees are bent. I'm afraid I'll injure myself because I'm so stiff. Best case scenario, I worry that I am not getting anything out of the workout because it's all wrong. Any time the teacher says, ""you should feel this [wherever]"" I either feel it in the middle of my spine or the backs of my knees.

I also dabble in various exercise classes and have occasionally signed up for various things like rock climbing, yoga, silks, and so on. None of it beats just staying in bed and being a lazy bum!

5t63t5,xxfitness,"Newbie questions about caloric intake, exercise schedule, and jogging/running","(ETA sorry for the long post; I'm really bad at being succinct)

Hey all! Hopefully it's okay for me to condense all these topics into one post. I've exercised and taken classes before, but for all intents and purposes just treat me like a total noob lol. I've lurked here for a couple of months, but I've recently gotten into fitness and had a couple of questions.

For reference, I'm 5'1"", 25yo, and 135lbs (The heaviest I've ever been). My main goal right now is weight/fat loss but eventually I'd like to build muscle as well.

1) I calculated my TDEE as per the FAQ link, and after doing all the math I've come to the conclusion that 1600/1700 is the amount of calories I should be consuming per day (ETA this seems really high to me, how do I tell if this is accurate?). My question is: I see people on here talking about a ""500/250 calorie deficit"" and I'm wondering if that's ON TOP of the 20% reduction from the initial calculation, or am I misunderstanding something?

2) I'm a full-time student. Right now I'm able to go to the gym MWF afternoon/evening. I'm focusing mostly on cardio in an attempt to lose weight/fat, though I am also doing light lifting, focusing mostly on upper body. My question is, is it okay to do this all in one gym visit? Should I be alternating? If I'm focusing more on cardio, do I need rest days or is it better to do an ""active"" rest day, or no rest day at all? Exercise schedules in general confuse me and I can't ever seem to find a simple explanation of how to set one up. Halp?

3) I want to jog. The elliptical and stationary bike are both really hard on my knees/thighs while the treadmill just gives me normal DOMS. The thing is, I CANNOT get past a brisk walk. I don't know why or what I'm doing wrong. I've scrutinized my form, my breathing, my pace, everything, and I can only jog for like thirty seconds before my chest/lungs feels like they're on fire. I want to jog! :( I love the feeling of jogging for those first thirty seconds, I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.

Sister's fiance mentioned it might be exercise-induced asthma (He has it), but no other cardio or other exercise makes me feel like that. I can take a pretty brisk pace on the elliptical without my lungs feeling like they're going to explode (just my knees)

Also, slightly unrelated, but..

I have ARFID (basically, my diet sucks and trying to eat unfamiliar food is a Literal Waking Nightmare of panic attacks) so I'm trying really hard to eat as healthy as I can, drink more water, and work out to better my quality and longevity of life, how I feel physically, and how I feel about my body image.

4k8rro,xxfitness,Stress Incontinence Resources (For those of us who can't stop peeing on the gym floor),"Hello my strong strong friends!

I've been working on a video that covers Stress Incontinence (when we pee during workouts or heavy lifts). I wanted to share some resources that I've collected with you while covering the topic.

As much as I want to overlook the fact that I've pissed all over the ground and make it seem like that just meant I was working really hard, Stress Incontinence is not normal functioning. There are some women who experience urinary leakage during working sets and not just when they are going for a 1RM. Aside from the health concern this can be annoying in a few ways:

* Now you have to clean the floor (please do that)
* The focus that should be on form is now distracted, could result in form breaking down
* Losing pressure created from your valsalva maneuver to protect your spine
* Back to the whole mess thing, running to the bathroom, changing, not being able to finish reps/sets/workouts, etc.

Now those scenarios are not life-threatening, but they aren't ideal gym scenarios. Longevity with lifting is key, and I want anyone who is experiencing incontinence issues and wants to correct them, there are answers!

My friend Allie, [who I interview in a video on her experience](https://youtu.be/PcvhxHdY_gI) found help from a Pelvic Floor/Women's Health Physical Therapist, Dr. Carrie Pagliano. In the video you can hear Allie's story and details on her physical therapy and things she's done to remedy her SUI. Below are notes from Dr. Pagliano and the big take-aways from the video:

**Causes of SUI**

* Muscle overactivity
* under activity
* poor timing/coordination

**Things that can contribute to SUI include**

* pregnancy
* Your gene pool (the make-up of the collagen that mom and dad gave you; sometimes they give you good elastic tissue that has good stiffness and support and sometimes not)
* chronic constipation
* chronic heavy lifting with poor mechanics
* can also come with some hip and low back pain issues

It's important to note that KEGALS aren't always the answer! Your pelvic floor can be overactive (in Allie's case) or underactive (common with women who've had children).

**Signs of pelvic floor overactivity:**  urinary urgency/frequency, painful sex or bowel movements, constipation, taking awhile to start your urine flow, leakage with heavy lifting or jumping/running

**Signs of pelvic floor under activity:**  loss of urine control with strong urge, leakage during heavy lifting or jumping/running

**Tips for people with SUI:**
* Figure out if you have overactivity or underactivity (can you contract AND relax your pelvic floor muscles)
* Assess if you have other symptoms (overactivity or underactivity)
* If you're not sure get it checked! [www.womenshealthapta.org](www.womenshealthapta.org)

Men can have pelvic floors and can have this problem too...and we treat them #equalopportunityPT)

**Tips for lifters**
* Not all tips work for everyone (ID the problem/cause first to pick the right solution!)
* ABC's- Alignment/form, breath, core (are you working from the inside-deepest muscles-out)
* Vocalization/exhalation typically activates the deepest abdominals (Transverse abdominals) and pelvic floor.  Since lifters are using breath-holding for postural support instead of breathing (that whole survival thing) sometimes you need a quick reminder to activate those deepest muscles if they're not already doing so.  The verbalization or quick controlled slight exhale can help get the deepest muscles working for you!

If you have questions, please feel free to leave them in the comments of the video, or contact [Carrie on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cj_paglianopt).

484dag,xxfitness,The short-girl-food-belly Problem,"Hi everyone! Long-time lurker, first post. This is pretty embarrassing, but I felt the need to tell someone (this seems like the most supportive place!) and could use some advice.  

My stomach is small and after a meal (and sometimes after a *drink*) it bellows out. I honestly look like I could be pregnant. After I use the bathroom (or in the morning before I've eaten), it looks normal again. It's frankly gross and unattractive.

I'm 5'1'', 105 pounds. I'm apple-shaped, meaning I gain more weight on my upper body than my lower (I hate this- I have disproportionately big tits and an ass that's tinier than tiny). After a long break from exercising, I started a pretty great regimen (alternating lifting and cardio) a little over a month ago. I've lost about 4 pounds (yay!) and am starting to gain some muscle definition. I'm on [what's essentially a 1200 calorie Ketogonic diet.](https://www.perriconemd.com/anti-aging-diets/anti-inflammatory-diet.html)

I understand I can't pick where to lose weight while ""cutting"" and smaller people tend to have the problem of showing even the 1-2 pounds of weight they might gain, but it's so frustrating and embarrassing. My clothes look so messed up and I can never wear anything remotely tight. Because I'm already small, the belly makes me look like a child. Does this happen to anyone else? What do you do about it? Should I change my diet or exercise regimen? Will it take more months to see a change in this? Will it ever change? 

If this is the wrong subreddit or if this has already been posted, I apologize (I searched, but I'm not even sure what the correct search terms for this would be). Thanks!!",2016-02-28 18:05:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/484dag/the_shortgirlfoodbelly_problem/

Thoughts?","[In this](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/brisk-walking-is-it-better-than-vigorous-exercise-for-losing-weight-1.3309458) article, Dr. Brett Belchetz claims that"" There's a healthy level of exercise which is exercising about three to four times a week, never more than about 30 minutes per exercise, or even less than that is enough and if you do it at that moderate pace not only are you going to help yourself lose weight more effectively, you're probably going to make yourself live longer.""

The study concluded that those who ran or exercised more intensely ran a higher risk of early mortality and had higher waist circumferences.

3mn0mb,xxfitness,Found a really informative article on saunas and endurance/hypertrophy!,"Hey friends! I love to use the sauna after my workouts but wanted to investigate the actual effects on my body. I found this [great article](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/04/10/saunas-hyperthermic-conditioning-2/) by Dr Rhonda Patrick on r/fitness  from a about a year ago and thought it was super cool. I haven't seen it posted here but I have seen quite a few questions about the usefulness of saunas so I thought why not share! Below I've copypasted the conclusion for those who don't want to read the whole thing, but as a biology student I loved it. 

>Acclimating your body to heat stress by intermittent whole-body hyperthermia via sauna use (‚Äúhyperthermic conditioning‚Äù) has been shown to:
**Enhance endurance by:** 
Increasing nutrient delivery to muscles thereby reducing the depletion of glycogen stores.
Reducing heart rate and reducing core temperature during workload.
**Increase muscle hypertrophy by preventing protein degradation through the following three means:**
Induction of heat shock proteins and a hormetic response (which has also been shown to increase longevity in lower organisms).
Cause a massive release of growth hormone.
Improving insulin sensitivity.
**Hyperthermic conditioning also has robust positive effects on the brain:**
Increases the storage and release of norepinephrine, which improves attention and focus.
Increases prolactin, which causes your brain to function faster by enhancing myelination and helps to repair damaged neurons.
Increases BDNF, which causes the growth of new brain cells, improves the ability for you to retain new information, and ameliorates certain types of depression and anxiety.
Causes a robust increase in dynorphin, which results in your body becoming more sensitive to the ensuing endorphins. 

Would love to hear anyone's thoughts, anecdotes, and other relevant studies! Much love, ladies.",2015-09-28 00:23:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/3mn0mb/found_a_really_informative_article_on_saunas_and/

38b1su,xxfitness,Is my body fixable / best plan of action,"I'm 21, 5'10 and 180lbs. I started last year and my max weight was 215 pounds. I lost 30 over the course of about 6 months and I've kept it off for another 6, so it's been a year.

I did it through calorie counting and I'm ready for the next step. I have a personal trainer teaching me how to use gym equipment and I'm looking into programs. I'm lifting 2-3 days a week and doing 30-45min of ""fat burning"" cardio about 5x a week now.

The biggest thing hurting my morale is concern that I'll never be able to undo the damage I did by gaining all this weight. My weight is concentrated in my stomach and thighs; my stomach fat/skin is firm (no stretch marks) but very big, and my thighs are big, soft, with lots of stretch marks and (as you'll see) what I think is loose skin.

My question:

* Have you seen other women similar to my physique get in attractive shape? Any encouraging progress pics to show it can be done?
* However, I'm really concerned I'll always have this belly hanging around, or it'll turn into loose skin or a weird little hanging bit I'll want to slice off.
* I'm also worried about hanging loose skin (on upper inner thighs) and my thighs being really soft.
* I know I need to reduce body fat %, lose weight and gain muscle to get results.
* What else can I do? What's the best order to do this in? Can it be simultaneous?

I realize I'm being very superficial - and I am getting healthy and fit for my own health and longevity as well - but I really am looking to build a physique I can be proud of, and I'd like to set my expectations now of what is possible or not.

Additionally, would Strong Curves be a good program for me to follow with this in mind while in a caloric deficit?

Thanks!

1mq0uln,Biohackers,The three fundamentals of Biohacking,"
This posts aims to provide a basic guide on the three fundamentals of biohacking. If you are interested in improving your health these three are your first steps and should be your main priority. Before doing anything else do these three things right at least 80% of the time. 

#### If you dont do these things right 80% of the time, please retain from asking for advice on supplements, peptides or other things to improve health! 

#### Citations are added ASAP

## Diet
### Ground rules
* Mostly minimally processed, plant forward meals (use 80/20: whole foods most of the time, some cheat meals are okay)

#### Macronutrients:
* Protein: 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day
* Fat: 0.6-1 g/kg/day via things like olive oil, nuts, seeds, egg, fish 
* Carbs: around activity, prioritize slow carbs and fiber (30-50g fiber/day) via legumes, whole grains, vegs, nuts, seeds. High fiber intakes track with lower mortality and NCD risk

#### Hydration
* Aim for at least 2.0 L/day as a woman and 2.5 L/day of water for men. Adjust for heat/activity. 

#### Fruits and Veggies
* Eat Fruits and Veggies every day. Try to incorporate them in every meal or snack

#### Bodyfat
* Try to stay between 10-20% as a man and 20-30% as a woman
* If your are above that, loose weight using a calorie deficit.

## Sleep
### Ground rules
* Target ~7-9 hours consistently; both short and long habitual sleep link to higher mortality
* Environment: Cool, quiet and completely dark sleep environment is optimal
* Caffeine cut off: avoid caffeine at least 6 hours before bed 

### Advancements
* Evening devices: no screens 1 hour before bed (if needed use blue light filter or glasses)
* Morning sunlight: As important as darkness at night is sunlight in the morning. Try get 10-20 minutes of sunlight as soon as possible after waking up
* Consistent schedule: Keep your sleep times as consistent as possible even on weekends

## Exercise
### Ground rules
* Weekly minimums: 150-300 min moderate or 75-150 min intense aerobic activity + strength training ‚â• 2x/week.
* Strength training is longevity training: muscle-strengthening activities are associated with 10-17% lower risk of all-cause mortality; combo with aerobic is best. Keep it simple. 45-60 minutes, twice a week with focus on compound movements.
* Move more, sit less: step count is a simple proxy - benefits show up from ~4400 steps/day in older adults and ~7000+/day in middle aged adults. 8-10k/day seem optimal for most people.

1mp7p2a,Biohackers,Help me live longer,"¬†

**Background**

38M. Reasonably active. I had leukaemia when I was 9 and made a full recovery at 11. I had a mix of chemotherapy and radiotherapy so I‚Äôm aware my life expectancy is shorter than most people. My DNA is probably damaged and other form of cancer is likely to manifest at some point in future.

**Goal**

I‚Äôm trying to do whatever I can to extend my health span and lifespan.

**Diet:**

I‚Äôve been doing intermittent fasting for 10+years. My eating window is around 6 hours. Twice a year I do a three-day water fast. I don‚Äôt restrict myself eating or not eating any particular group of food. I‚Äôve tried to get more of my protein source from plants and reduce my protein intake. I‚Äôm still taking in between 50-70g of protein each day I reckon. I drink a lot of green tea/black tea (mainly Chinese tea)/matcha, averaging 6 cups per day. I use loose leaf tea so I just re-steep and add tea leaves if needed. I stop drinking caffeinated drinks from 2pm.

**Exercises:**

I have a desk job but I‚Äôm reasonably active. My apple watch tells me I work out roughly 60mins per day on an average week. My workout routine:

I hit the gym at least three times a week (a combo of strength training and cardio)

Interval training for 20mins at least once a week to get the heart rate zone 4+ for 80%+ of the time

I cycle to work (5 miles each way) twice a week. I also cycle to tennis etc. On average I cycle 40 miles a week.

I play tennis (or padel) twice a week (1 hr each)

I play badminton once a week for an hour

**Sleep**

I sleep reasonably well and normally manage to sleep for 8 hours per night.

**Supplements**

Note: Same number means they are from the same pill

**Questions:**

I think I‚Äôm doing okay on diet and exercise front (although always open to change for the better) so my questions are mainly on supplements:

What should I start/stop taking?

Should I space out when I take these supplements for maximum absorption (or so they don‚Äôt interfere with each other)? At thee moment, unless stated otherwise, I take my supplements in two chunks, morning, then after first meal, then magnesium 2 hour before bed time

With supplements, the markets aren‚Äôt regulated here in the UK so it‚Äôs difficult to know what brand to go for. Even if they claim they do independent testing and provide lab reports I don‚Äôt know if (1) they are fake reports or (2) that the reports are genuine but they do a switcheroo and give you something else. With common vitamins I can buy from some well known brands but with like NMN or Spermidine it‚Äôs really just about trust. Are there any reputable longevity brands in the UK?

EDIT: This post does not aim at beginners asking beginner questions. This posts aims at people responding to detailed questions or every questions in general with ""Sleep and eat healthy"" even when its clear that this is basic knowledge.

If someone asks ""What is the best and easiest thing I can do to get healthier?"" of course good sleep and diet is the answer but throwing that under every post is unnecessary

  
EDIT 2: Who would be interested in creating a ""Basis of biohacking"" post with basic advice for the first 80%?

EDIT 3: Why are redditors always a bunch  of absolutists. Of course there are times where advice like this is needed and wanted. But this stuff gets thrown around under any post whether this is wanted or not.

EDIT 4: I am more and more convinced that people either dont read the whole post or deliberately try to interprete in a negative way to comment something to blame me or someone. 

Yes, exercise, diet and sleep will provide 80-90% of the benefits you can get.

Yes, most people do not this or do not know how.

No, I do not hate beginners or want them basically banned from the sub reddit and this post does not imply this. Consider reading this post again if you think this.

We‚Äôve all got access to heart rate, even HRV and sleep data ‚Äî but whenever I search for actual,¬†robust muscle tracking devices¬†I‚Äôm honestly shocked by how little there is on the market.

To me it makes sense-- I mostly biohack for athletic performance (I know many of your are more on the longevity side of things) -- muscle create movement, so more data should be better? I feel like there's so much potential in things like injury prevention, maximizing gains, and neurological pattern awareness?

1mhwwps,Biohackers,Am I overthinking or is this a solid longevity routine? (22M),"Hey! I‚Äôm 22, pretty healthy, exercise regularly and just starting to think long-term about health and aging. I‚Äôve been listening to a bunch of the classic podcasts trying to find a not insane middle ground between doing nothing and over-supplementing.

Right now my **basic supplement routine** looks like:

* Vitamin D3 + k2 (1000 IU + 180mcg) 
* Magnesium Glycinate (300mg at night) 
* Fish Oil (2000mg \~500EPA)
* L-Theanine (100-200mg in the morning) 

**Exercise** 

* Push, Pull,Legs (every 2 days)
* Cardio 2x week (\~5-10km run, no gels) 
* 1x Kettlebell hiit 5m swings.

**Extra**

* Long walk/hike 5-10km Sunday's.
* Try aim for 20m stretch / 20m meditation each night. 
* Aim for 7k steps a day (work office job but go for walks every morning)
* Sleep pretty good 9:30am - 5:30am

Sometimes I wonder if I *should* be taking more stuff like creatine, multivitamin, zinc, etc  but I also don‚Äôt want to take a bunch of pills every day unless it‚Äôs actually worth it. I‚Äôve also got some family history of heart issues (grandfather had heart attacks, another had a stroke), which is making me think more about prevention.

So yeah, am I overthinking this or is this a decent minimalist stack for someone my age who‚Äôs trying to stay sharp and avoid chronic disease long-term?

Would love to hear what‚Äôs worked for others in their early 20s who are focused on healthspan over lifespan.

1mhvkqf,Biohackers,Researcher studying aging science: AMA about what the data actually shows,"Hey anti-aging community!

I'm a doctoral student, and I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of aging science for my thesis! My research compares health profiles between young adults and elderly subjects (both frail and non-frail), looking at:

‚Ä¢	Metabolic biomarkers that predict healthy aging

‚Ä¢	Hormone profiles and how they change over time

‚Ä¢	Nutritional factors that impact longevity

‚Ä¢	Key differences between those who age successfully vs. those who don't

What I'm discovering might surprise you! The data reveals incredible insights about what actually drives healthy aging at the molecular level.

The data, which will be published very soon in a scientific journal, shows fascinating patterns. I figure I can share some key insights related to this topic in layman's terms, so ask me anything! Whether you're curious about:

‚Ä¢	Which metabolic markers are potential predictors of healthy aging?

‚Ä¢	How do hormones really change as we age?

1m9cvaq,Biohackers,Biohacker who injected his son's blood wants to sell his anti-aging business to build a new religion,,2025-07-25 22:26:45,https://nationalpost.com/news/science/biohacker-bryan-johnson-anti-aging-dont-die
1m9bbmr,Biohackers,Bob Becker: 80 y/o Ultrarunner,"On July 9^(th), Bob Becker became the oldest person to complete the¬†Badwater¬†135 mile race. He had just turned 80.¬†Badwater¬†winds through Death Valley, and the thermometer peaked at 120 ¬∞F during this year's race. So much for old timers not doing well in the heat!¬†¬†

When I read this a few days ago, I barely believed it. 52% of men don't live to 80, per the SSA actuarial tables.¬†And almost all those 80 year olds couldn't run a hundred feet if they had to. The big question in my head was how any 80 year old's physical ability could last so long at such a vigorous level. Perhaps what's even more impressive is that Bob ran¬†Badwater¬†in 2015 (age 70). After finishing, he wasn't done though. He partook in the¬†post race¬†festivities, got some sleep, then hiked up 11 miles to tag the summit of Mt. Whitney, and re-ran the entire course for a ""double¬†Badwater."" Insane behavior!¬†

I started digging into this guy, and found a good interview of him on the Ageless Athlete podcast. Some online comments explain the anomaly of Bob by suggesting that he lived a healthy lifestyle and didn't wear out his body by being active in his younger years. They attribute his longevity to healthy living but relative inactivity.¬†¬†

From the podcast, this doesn't seem to be the case. Bob smoked from age 18-28 and still has scar tissue in his lungs from this. He ran the mile in high school and for decades did boot camp style HIIT workouts several times a week. Additionally, Bob played recreational basketball for decades. His nose was broken three times during play. During his first ultra at the Marathon des Sables, he fractured his femur, requiring surgery and pins to repair. So the guy's body definitely had a lot of use and even some mis-use before he got into running at 57.¬†¬†

It sounds like overall he's been a pretty healthy guy since quitting smoking, but I didn't get a health-freak vibe from the hour and a half interview. He sounds more like someone who loves having a good time. The reason for his first marathon was to ""party with friends"" afterwards. He didn't mention alcohol, but he sounds like the type of guy who has not been a teetotaler his whole life. 

I've heard that a pillar of lifespan is maximizing total muscle mass so that the negative effects of age-induced muscle wasting¬†are pushed forward as far as possible. Bob has never done much mass or peak strength work, and has never been particularly muscular from the photos I found of him. His diet seems to have been healthy, but typical his entire life (including some processed foods, meats, dairy, occasional restaurants). Only around 77 did he and his wife adopt a strict diet, which he said is vegan and has almost no oil or fats other than peanut butter. His current diet seems to be low protein, since he mentioned that he doesn't do many supplements other than some vitamins. How he's recovering from his workouts and extreme races on a low protein diet is another great question. Additionally, he often runs fasted or after eating a single running gel as his breakfast. Fasted runs are becoming less common among elite runners since it can lead to low energy availability and under-recovery. Bob also mentioned that he needs to get more sleep, since he is always busy with training and being a full time race organizer for multiple ultras.¬†¬†¬†

So it seems that he's not done much in the way of longevity other than work out and eat fairly healthy food for many decades, then adopt an extreme training regimen around age 60. I'm sure the ultrarunning has¬†significantly¬†slowed his biological ageing rate, but I'm blown away that his body has been able to endure such grueling races without breaking down (\~50 ultras in 20 years, including many 100 milers). Whose parents or grandparents are about to hop on a marathon training plan? Even if those folks have been healthy their whole lives?¬†

I can think of four things to explain the anomaly of Bob Becker: size, genetics, connectedness, and mindset. From photos of Bob, he appears to be a pretty small guy, probably around 5' 8"" during his youth. Smaller humans live longer, so this likely accounts for some of Bob's extraordinarily slow ageing.¬†¬†

There's the classic genetics card of course. It can't be an internet conversation about an athlete without attributing most of their success to genetics. These attributions do have merit though.¬†Bob's sister's son is Olympian Adam Goucher. Adam's best 10K time is 27:59, and his best 5K time is 13:10, both elite. So clearly there is high-level aerobic and running ability not far in his family tree.¬†¬†

Bob mentioned that his favorite thing to do each day is spend quality time with his wife. He seems to have a strong, positive relationship with her. Bob also mentioned that he is very close to his three children and all the cousins on one side of his family. Despite being all over the USA, they regularly visit each other. Additionally, Bob has made many lifelong friends through the past twenty years of running, people who have been there beside him as crew and pacers, and people that he has paced and organized races for. Extreme moments create deep bonds. Connectedness has been shown by The Harvard Study to increase lifespan. And Bob is definitely a well-connected guy.¬†¬†

Mindset could be the biggest contributor to Bob's longevity though. Photos of Bob display what appears to be a sun-weathered guy in his late fifties or early sixties. Full head of hair that still has some color in it, and always a smile. In many photos, Bob is grinning and seems to be having a genuinely good time. This is despite many of these photos being in the middle of a grueling footrace. From the podcast interview, I got the impression that Bob has a very adventurous and confident spirit. His ""why not"" attitude and love of challenge and adventure have clearly kept him out there when almost all his peers hung up their sneakers decades ago. ""You don't stop running because you get old. You get old because you stop running.""¬†¬†

Bob spoke of always focusing on the moment, especially when running. He doesn't seem like a guy preoccupied with himself, lost in¬†self contemplation. He's always doing, always moving, and that is a state of mind that gives purpose and delays ageing. If you don't act old, and age is rarely a thought in your head, are you really old? I think this is very much the case with Bob.¬†¬†

Bob also seems to be a low stress guy, despite being far busier and more productive than his peers. I think this low stress comes from his fundamental belief in himself and his focus on the moment. If you believe that you have the ability to give anything a good try, and you always focus on what needs to be done in the present moment, then you probably aren't doing a whole lot of worrying and thus aren't mentally or emotionally stressed. Sleep is then more efficient, stress hormones are low, and happiness is high, all good for staying young.¬†¬†

So that's it, an incredible guy who's more adventurous at 80 than most of us at 30. I believe this is due to his attitude/self belief, connectedness to friends, genetics, and small physical size. I'd love to hear others' thoughts on Bob and his remarkable longevity.¬†¬†",2025-07-25 21:22:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1m9bbmr/bob_becker_80_yo_ultrarunner/

1lxyczh,Biohackers,4 days of water fasting led to complete remission of my SSRI withdrawal symptoms and mental health issues,"I am blown away right now. This is not my first time water fasting and I am already highly Keto adapted since I been on a high fat, carb free diet for over a year before I started this fast. My main reason for Keto was mental and physical health as well as optimized metabolism and longevity. I will for sure stick with this WOE for life. 

I already experienced a massive improvement in my mental health issues including depression and borderline personality disorder through the ketogenic diet but still was on Fluvoxamine, which I started taking even before learning about the benefits of Keto for mental health. After years of debilitating mental health, I was finally feeling so good every single day that I did not want to change anything. Unfortunately, then good old pharma said f that and pulled Fluvoxamine from the market in Germany. It is no longer offered by any pharmaceutical company and hence I had to quit since I had terrible experiences with other SSRIs. With Fluvoxamine however, I was still kinda feeling like myself, not like a full blown zombie. I still had a solid libido and sensitivity in my wiener, unlike many other SSRIs. Only thing I noted is how I was less emotional and everything was kinda ""meehh, okay"" no matter if good or bad. I was also loosing a lot of my focus, probably due to suppressed dopamine levels and signaling caused by amplified serotonin levels.

But after over a year of taking Fluvoxamine, I was out of tabs and had no other choice but to quit cold turkey, which turned out to be horrible. First two weeks I had terrible physical symptoms including insomnia, brain zaps, vertigo, inability to focus, light sensibility etc. Once that started to settle, the next phase started to reveal itself in which I became terribly irritable and agitated. I was a complete asshole to everyone around me and started throwing tantrums even if somebody asked me normal questions or pissed me off the slightest. It was insane and nothing like I usually am (I have the quiet, discouraged BPD subtype). Fortunately, my gf was very understanding and never threw it back at me. Then, about 5-6 weeks into the withdrawal, my mood started to change and from one day to the next my depression was back. It was like dark clouds started to cast over me and I was right back where I was before I started Keto and Fluvoxamine despite all the mental work I had done in the meantime. It was terrible, I was helpless and did not know how to deal with myself because the old side of me started revealing itself from one day to the next without any warning. All of the sudden I could not work or do everyday tasks anymore. I could not be alone. It was terrible.

So after 2 days into this, I made a decision: I am not gonna go through this again just because of some stupid SSRIs. I hypothesized that water fasting would help change my brain chemistry and pull me right out of this mess and since I had planned to go for a longer water fast anyways in the next few weeks, I decided to pull the trigger and stopped eating right away. Switched to water only and tons of electrolyte to keep my system running smoothly. The first 3 days were tough despite me being fat adapted. Not because of my hunger, but because my mental state was still incredibly rough. Then after 3 days of water fasting it was like someone was casting away the clouds and bright sunshine entered my life again. It took exactly 4 days until the water fast took away ALL of my SSRI withdrawal symptoms and I became the old me again. While still going through the physical stress of fasting, I developed the old mental energy and state of mind I was used to from before. I wanted to work and get things done again, I immediately went to the gym and had good strength and from that day on I did 2h of incline treadmill every day. While physically I was easily fatigued my mental energy was through the roof. I wanted to do things, get things done in the household and at work, started getting a very positive outlook and positive self talk again. Finally, I was able to support and comfort myself again after 6 weeks of SSRI withdrawal. 

  
I am now 9 days into my fast and despite being pretty lean (athletic and muscular, 6'3, 96kg), I want to go for at least 14 days of water fasting. If any of you is going through any of this, as crazy as it sounds, inform yourself about water fasting, it is not something dangerous, it is something we have done all the time throughout our evolution and in my opinion it is the human super power. We are incredibly good at fasting and can go extremely prolonged periods of time without food. 

  
If you are struggling with mental health, definitely also look at the Ketogenic diet as a therapy as promoted by Metabolic Mind, Dr. Georgia Ede and Dr. David Palmer. This stuff is life changing and no food in the world is worth the relief you feel once you become keto adapted.

1lxrq79,Biohackers,"Newb starting with supplements, did I do alright?","40(F) I will admit that I have very little to no knowledge on how or where to start my biohacking journey. I began it inadvertently when I started using Tirzepatide to control my appetite, then began Sculptra treatments to regenerate collagen. I came across a famous biohacker on YT that cannot be named, and sure, he's extreme, but his obsessive behavior is something I relate to (OCD myself), and it sparked curiosity. (I have no intention of following his routines, but he definitely motivated me to start researching longevity).

I'm only just beginning to learn about methods, treatments, etc., I figured starting with supplements would be a safe place to start. I'm easing into supplementation and will increase over time if and when necessary. 

Did I do ok? Is there anything here you feel I'm missing? I'm aware there are better, more pure and higher dosage supplements out there, but I chose these as a safe starting point.

1lw78cr,Biohackers,Market for Cushioned Barefoot Shoes?,"Hello all!

Barefoot shoes over the last couple of years have been gaining a lot of prominence when it comes to discussions on foot health and longevity. I use Vivobarefoots for the gym and can appreciate the impact having a wide toe box has on foot health. However, most barefoot shoe options that I see (Xero, Altra, Vivo, etc.) either have a subjectively bad design, or are designed for for the super niche category where transitioning is a challenge. I myself would not use barefoot shoes when I travel or have to walk around a lot.

Do you think there is a market for a category of shoes that have a zero heel drop, a wide toe box, but have a great cushion support and a minimal design? The one I want to design is primarily for casual daily use and walking that combines certain benefits of barefoot shoes but provides the comfort of ASICS Gel Nimbus. Or is this whole thing just a waste of time?

1mtmp21,Supplements,Supplement stack help?,"Hey guys, new to working out/biohacking/supplements. Have a lot more time and stability lately so I've gotten more into my health. I've always been relatively healthy and done light exercise, but only started taking things more seriously about a month agao. Right now I'm taking the following 5 core supplements, which I started about a week ago:

Creatine (5g in the AM, with coffee)
D3 + K2 (125/100mcg)
Algae Oil (2 gels, 715mg)
Taurine (1000mg in afternoon)
Magnesium Glycinate (200mg in afternoon, 200mg 1 hour before bed)

And I just added yesterday:

L-Theanine (200mg in the AM) for the jitters in the morning from the caffeine.

I've been looking at:

Probiotic (have some gastro issues, always have)
Life Extension 2 Per Day/Health Booster (in place of a multi, also looking at their NAD+)
Tongkat Ali (feel like I may have low T, but not yet clinically validated. This seems like the safest option to rotate in)
CDP-Choline (cognitive function, I experience some brain fog)
Berberine (comes as a recommended longevity supplement)

For extra information, I'm 26 years old. Male, 5'9"" and about 150lbs. Lean, some muscle. Looking to stay lean but tone more and add some muscle (though this will be most training/diet). Goal with supplements is mainly just to cover any possible deficiencies, increase my overall energy (and libido), live a longer life, and mostly just feel ""healthier"". I want to be prepared to tackle whatever life throws at me, physically and mentally. I also strongly value my supplements being as evidence-backed as possible (less pseudo-science).

So, do we think I'm off to a good start with my current 5? I certainly feel better than before I took them as far as energy goes (mostly due to getting much better sleep I presume), but I'm not sure if the other things I'm looking at would slot in well for me or are considered overkill. I plan to give this core setup a bit more time so I can be sure it works well for me and then add the others gradually. Any suggestions to round this out?

It also¬†[seems to](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5521855/)¬†lower plasma endotoxin units, diminish circulating TNF‚ÄëŒ±, and resolve hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance in mouse models. In addition, cholestyramine¬†[seems to](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6154278/)¬†modulate immunoregulatory bile acid.

I can't find any studies on it, but at least theoretically, it seems as if cholestyramine might work well at the tail end of a dasatinib + quercetin (and/or fisetin) senolytic phase to: improve toxin and waste elimination, reduce inflammatory symptoms, support liver and gut function, and improve the overall tolerability and efficacy of senolytic therapy.

Of course, the things to look out for would be: cholestyramine binding to fat soluble vitamins or other supplements/medications which would need to be spaced out from taking it.

1lcx5b4,Supplements,"Combining 100‚Äì200 mg L-theanine with coffee significantly enhances sustained attention, improves accuracy, and speeds reaction times through increased GABA and glycine signaling","Thought this was quite interesting

From Rhonda Patrick's new episode about the longevity benefits of coffee. [**Here is the timestamp.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgrV9rjqQyA&t=2719s)

I think a lot of people know about how l-theanine calms the caffeine jitters, but it seems to actually amplify coffee's cognitive benefits as well 

From her [**show notes**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/coffee)**:**

>On its own, L-theanine can induce relaxation, improve focus, and promote sleep. But the real power comes when it's combined with coffee (caffeine)‚Äîwhich appears to alter the pharmacological profile of coffee and influence its effects on cognition and the nervous system. This combo is a popular combination among those who are sensitive to caffeine or those who want focus without the jitters.

>Adding L-theanine to coffee has been demonstrated to:

>**Enhance focus:**¬†It¬†[improves attention, speed, and accuracy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18681988/#:%7E:text=in%2027%20participants,performance%20on%20cognitively%20demanding%20tasks)¬†and reduces distractions and mind-wandering during cognitively demanding tasks.

>**Lower anxiety:**¬†On its own, L-theanine has anxiolytic effects. When combined with caffeine, it reduces anxiety and tension, particularly during stressful scenarios like test taking.

>**Reduce ""jitters"":**¬†It mitigates side effects of caffeine¬†[including blood pressure spikes and the ""wired"" feeling](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25761837/#:%7E:text=,interaction%20between%20these%20substances)¬†that caffeine can cause in some people‚Äîproviding a relaxed yet focused state.

>The mechanism behind the L-theanine and caffeine synergy is that L-theanine seems to balance caffeine-induced stimulation by calming the brain‚Äînotably by increasing the activity of alpha waves ([an effect that occurs within 45 minutes of taking L-theanine](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301051107001573)). Because L-theanine increases the inhibitory, calming neurotransmitter known as GABA as well as dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, it¬†*reduces*¬†excitation and provides a relaxing but not sedating effect. Importantly, taking L-theanine with caffeine doesn't alter the¬†*metabolism*¬†of caffeine‚Äîonly its subjective and physiological effects. That means you still need to be cautious about not drinking coffee too close to bedtime.

>Practically, here's the recommendation if you're interested in maximizing the cognitive benefits of your coffee:

>\- Pair about one cup of coffee (100‚Äì150 mg caffeine) with 100‚Äì200 mg L-theanine for a 1:2 or a 2:1 ratio of L-theanine:caffeine  
\- Take them at the same time‚Äîthey have similar absorption kinetics, so simultaneous intake works best.  
\-You can easily find L-Theanine as a powder or capsule; it dissolves directly into coffee and has minimal taste (and isn't degraded by heat).  
\- This combination is safe, well-studied, and low-risk at these doses.

Based on the type of discussions and evidence-based preferences on r/supplements, here's a ranked list of supplements that may complement your current regimen and goals‚Äîespecially for joint health, cognitive maintenance, and long-term well-being‚Äîwhile also accounting for your thyroid condition, age, and active lifestyle.

# ü•á Tier 1: High Priority (Strong Evidence + Relevant to Your Goals)

1. **Magnesium (Glycinate or Threonate)**
   * **Why**: Magnesium is frequently discussed on r/supplements for its role in muscle function, sleep quality, mood, and bone health. Magnesium glycinate is gentle on the stomach and supports relaxation, while magnesium threonate may have added brain benefits.
   * **Dose**: 200‚Äì400 mg daily
   * **Short-term**: Improves sleep, helps with recovery, reduces cramping
   * **Long-term**: Supports brain health, metabolic function, and may help with thyroid hormone conversion
2. **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA, ideally from fish oil or algae)**
   * **Why**: Even if you eat seafood every other week, you may not hit optimal EPA/DHA intake. These fatty acids are highly anti-inflammatory, support joint lubrication, and improve cardiovascular and cognitive health.
   * **Dose**: 1000‚Äì2000 mg combined EPA/DHA per day
   * **Short-term**: Joint comfort, reduced inflammation, improved mood
   * **Long-term**: Brain preservation, cardiovascular support, longevity
3. **Collagen (Type I & III, possibly with Vitamin C)**
   * **Why**: On r/supplements, collagen (especially hydrolyzed peptides) is popular among athletes for joint and tendon support. Some research supports reduced injury and faster healing.
   * **Dose**: 10‚Äì15 g daily
   * **Short-term**: Joint support, potential improvement in skin elasticity
   * **Long-term**: May slow joint degeneration, tendon and ligament support

# ü•à Tier 2: Medium Priority (May Help Depending on Individual Variation)

1. **Zinc (Monomethionine or Picolinate)**
   * **Why**: Zinc is crucial for thyroid hormone metabolism and immune support. Deficiencies are more common in people with hypothyroidism.
   * **Dose**: 15‚Äì30 mg every other day with food (to avoid copper imbalance)
   * **Short-term**: Immune support
   * **Long-term**: Thyroid health, testosterone balance, antioxidant defense
2. **Ashwagandha (KSM-66 or Sensoril extract)**
   * **Why**: Frequently discussed as a stress adaptogen, it may support thyroid function (T3/T4 conversion), reduce cortisol, and improve recovery.
   * **Dose**: 300‚Äì600 mg/day
   * **Short-term**: Stress resilience, better sleep, energy
   * **Long-term**: HPA-axis regulation, possibly supports thyroid function and cognition

# ü•â Tier 3: Optional Add-Ons (Niche Use, Mild Effects, or Less Evidence)

1. **Turmeric/Curcumin (with BioPerine for absorption)**
   * **Why**: Anti-inflammatory, may help joint pain and long-term brain health. Some mixed evidence, but often taken by those doing strenuous activity.
   * **Dose**: 500‚Äì1000 mg/day with fat and black pepper
   * **Optional**: For inflammation and joint longevity
2. **Lion‚Äôs Mane Mushroom (Hericium erinaceus)**
   * **Why**: Popular in r/Nootropics and occasionally r/supplements for neurogenesis and cognition. Limited human studies but promising.
   * **Dose**: 500‚Äì1000 mg extract (fruiting body) 1‚Äì2x/day
   * **Optional**: For long-term cognitive support and memory
3. **Glucosamine + Chondroitin or MSM**
   * **Why**: Older joint health supplements. Mixed data, but some users swear by them for climbing-related wear and tear.
   * **Optional**: Only if you feel joint degradation or want additional insurance

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Already Covered

* **Vitamin D3 (7500 IU)**: Likely sufficient, but periodic blood testing is encouraged to ensure you‚Äôre not overshooting (>100 ng/mL can be harmful).
* **MK-7 (180 mcg)**: Smart inclusion with high-dose D3, helps regulate calcium.
* **Creatine (5g)**: Excellent for strength, recovery, and cognition.

# Final Notes:

* **Labs**: Consider checking magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 status (or at least a 25(OH)D test for Vitamin D).
* **Timing**: Magnesium before bed, omega-3 with meals, ashwagandha in the morning or evening (depending on how it affects your energy).
* **Brands**: Look for third-party tested brands like Thorne, Jarrow, NOW, Pure Encapsulations, or Doctor‚Äôs Best (frequently recommended on r/supplements).

---

Thoughts? Seems pretty straightforward.

I had it recommend a dosing schedule, but I still need to know which brands to purchase. Any specific recommendations for:

1. **Magnesium (Glycinate or Threonate)**
2. **Omega-3**
3. **Collagen (Type I & III, possibly with Vitamin C)**

1kfllhx,Supplements,my observation on Taurine supplementation,"I am 24 M at b.w of 80 kgs I‚Äôve been training consistently for 1.5 years, and for the longest time, my squats were stuck. I plateaued hard at 100 kg for 12 reps across 3 sets. No matter what I did, I couldn‚Äôt add a single kilo without sacrificing form or depth.

Then I came across taurine and read about its anti-aging and antioxidant benefits. I figured, why not try it with my whey post-workout? I don‚Äôt take any other supplements and wasn‚Äôt expecting much ‚Äî my main goal was to improve recovery.

For the first week, I felt no noticeable difference. But then came leg day.

After warming up, something in me said, ""Let‚Äôs try 120 kg."" I told myself I could always drop back down if it felt too heavy. But the moment I unracked it and went for the first rep, it felt like *butter*. I went on to complete 3 sets of 12 reps at 120 kg ‚Äî clean form, no belt. It felt unreal. I had grit I didn‚Äôt know I had.

At first, I thought it was a placebo. But now, after 4 weeks of consistent taurine supplementation (5g daily), I‚Äôve started repping 140 kg for 8 reps as my final set ‚Äî starting from 120 kg. I genuinely believe I can push toward double bodyweight squats soon.

This isn‚Äôt newbie gains or steroids. Just taurine and consistent training. I‚Äôm honestly more proud of the progress than the numbers.

Other things I‚Äôve noticed:

* Got noticeably leaner despite no change in diet
* Pumps aren‚Äôt crazy, but contractions feel smoother and stronger on heavy loads
* Maxed out dumbbells at the gym

I‚Äôd love to get advice or a checklist of the **most essential supplements and micronutrients** I should focus on as someone:

* Training at high intensity and frequency (2x/day)
* Prioritizing **cognitive function and mental energy**
* Interested in overall **resilience, immune support**, and **long-term health**

I already try to eat clean and stay hydrated, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm missing key micros or underestimating the need for certain supplements.

Would really appreciate insights from others who train hard or know the science well‚Äîwhat works, what‚Äôs overhyped, and what truly matters.

Thanks in advance!",2025-05-03 02:28:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kdiheu/supplements_micronutrients_for_twicedaily_boxing/

1jym18x,Supplements,More Notes for Beginners: Understanding Supplements Without the Hype,"
Hey everyone. This is a post for people who are new to supplements, or just starting to explore the world of health optimization. I wrote this with the help of ChatGPT, but it reflects my own thoughts and experience, too. There‚Äôs a lot of noise out there‚Äîthis is meant to bring some structure and make things easier to understand.

Let‚Äôs break it down.

‚∏ª

1. What Are Supplements?

Supplements are compounds‚Äînutrients, molecules, plant extracts, or amino acids‚Äîthat we take to support health. They‚Äôre not magic, and they‚Äôre not meant to replace medications or a healthy lifestyle. But they can be useful, depending on your goals.

Some are essential for life (like vitamin D), some are naturally made in your body (like creatine or CoQ10), and some are found in food or plants (like EGCG from green tea or curcumin from turmeric). They‚Äôre used for different reasons‚Äîpreventing deficiencies, improving performance, slowing aging, or protecting organs.

‚∏ª

2. Categories of Supplements

There are many ways to classify supplements, but this is a simple breakdown I like:

A. Essential Nutrients
These are vitamins, minerals, and amino acids your body needs to survive. You can get them from food, but some people need more.
Examples: Vitamin D, magnesium, B12, zinc, iodine, omega-3s.

B. Endogenous Compounds (Produced by the Body)
These are substances your body makes, but production declines with age or illness. Supplementing may help support energy, brain health, or aging.
Examples: Creatine, CoQ10, carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, glutathione, NAD+ boosters.

C. Bioactive Compounds (Not Essential, But Beneficial)
These aren‚Äôt required for life, but your body can still use them in powerful ways. Many are found in plants or fermented foods.
Examples: EGCG (from green tea), curcumin (from turmeric), sulforaphane (from broccoli sprouts), ergothioneine (from mushrooms), astaxanthin (from algae or seafood).

D. Herbal or Traditional Extracts
Often used in traditional medicine systems like TCM or Ayurveda. Can contain many active compounds. Some are well-researched, others less so.
Examples: Berberine, ginseng, ashwagandha, rhodiola, milk thistle.
Some of these are potent and shouldn‚Äôt always be taken every day or without understanding dosage and context.

‚∏ª

3. Supplement Safety: What to Know

Some supplements are incredibly safe‚Äîsafer than salt, caffeine, or even aspirin. Others can interact with meds or build up in the body.

Relatively safe for most people:
Magnesium (especially glycinate), creatine, taurine, CoQ10, PQQ, ergothioneine, vitamin D (in proper amounts), fish oil (if stored well).

Use caution or talk to a doctor first:
Preformed vitamin A, high-dose iron (if not deficient), copper, yohimbine, kava, large doses of herbal extracts, or poorly regulated brands.

Note: Always tell your doctor if you‚Äôre taking supplements, especially if you‚Äôre on blood thinners, have kidney/liver issues, are pregnant, or are managing a condition.

‚∏ª

4. Why Most Doctors Don‚Äôt Recommend Supplements

It‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre bad‚Äîit‚Äôs often because doctors weren‚Äôt trained in this area. Medical school focuses on diagnosing and treating disease, not optimizing health or preventing long-term decline with nutritional compounds. And since most supplements aren‚Äôt FDA-approved as treatments, doctors may feel unsure or cautious about recommending them, especially when there‚Äôs a lack of large-scale human data.

That said, this is not about choosing supplements instead of medication. You take meds when you need them. But supplements might help with prevention, performance, and long-term resilience, depending on your situation.

‚∏ª

5. What‚Äôs the Evidence Behind Supplements?

Some people say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no evidence.‚Äù That‚Äôs not true. There is evidence‚Äîbut it depends on what you‚Äôre looking for.

There are multiple types of evidence:

‚Ä¢	Mechanistic studies (what it does at the cellular level)

‚Ä¢	Animal studies (often showing longevity or disease delay)

‚Ä¢	Clinical trials (yes, real trials‚Äîon things like garlic, creatine, omega-3s, vitamin D)

‚Ä¢	Small-scale human studies (especially in newer compounds)

‚Ä¢	Epidemiological data (population-based trends)

‚Ä¢	Systematic reviews/meta-analyses (combining all the above)

No single study proves everything, but when the mechanism, the animal data, and the human results all point in the same direction‚Äîand the compound is safe‚Äîsome people (like me) think it‚Äôs worth betting on.

‚∏ª

6. Example Supplements Worth Knowing About

Just a few of the well-researched, beginner-friendly ones:

‚Ä¢	Creatine ‚Äì Muscle, brain, and mitochondrial support. Very safe, very studied.

‚Ä¢	Vitamin D3 ‚Äì Immune system, bones, mental health. Low levels are common.

‚Ä¢	Vitamin K2 (MK-7) ‚Äì Helps keep calcium out of your arteries and in your bones.

‚Ä¢	Taurine ‚Äì Linked to longevity in animals, supports heart and metabolic health.

‚Ä¢	CoQ10 ‚Äì Especially useful if you‚Äôre on statins or want mitochondrial support.

‚Ä¢	Ergothioneine ‚Äì A powerful antioxidant some researchers call a ‚Äúlongevity vitamin.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	Magnesium ‚Äì Over 300 cellular roles. Most people are low and don‚Äôt know it.

1jpkb5b,Supplements,David Sinclair Is a Fraud? That‚Äôs Cute. Let Me Introduce You to Actual Nuance.,"
Ah yes, the hive mind has spoken:
David Sinclair is a fraud.
Why? Because some YouTube GP with soothing voiceover tones and a supplement line told you so.

Let‚Äôs break this down for the slow clap crowd.

David Sinclair‚Äîa tenured Harvard professor, cited thousands of times, who co-discovered the role of sirtuins in aging, helped bring NAD+ biology into the mainstream, and is now working on epigenetic reprogramming to literally reverse biological age in mammals‚Äîhe‚Äôs the fraud?

He‚Äôs published in Cell, Nature, Science‚Äîbut sure, go off, some guy on Reddit said he sells NMN so he must be evil.

Meanwhile, here comes Dr. Brad Stanfield, the anti-aging world‚Äôs answer to watching paint dry.
	‚Ä¢	A GP with a death grip on the ‚Äúsensible middle ground‚Äù,
	‚Ä¢	Whose most daring contribution to science is a rapamycin trial that says, ‚ÄúWhat if old people exercised‚Ä¶ but also took a very tiny amount of rapamycin?‚Äù
Groundbreaking stuff, truly.

He critiques Sinclair for having conflicts of interest‚Ä¶ while literally selling his own supplement line, and‚Äîwait for it‚Äîdistorting the evidence in his videos to make it look like the stuff he sells is the gold standard.
But no conflict there, folks! That‚Äôs just good ol‚Äô ‚Äúevidence-based medicine.‚Äù

And of course, his followers‚Äîwho I can only assume were bottle-fed PubMed abstracts instead of formula‚Äîparrot his every word as if he‚Äôs the second coming of Popper.
‚ÄúSinclair‚Äôs a fraud!‚Äù
‚ÄúNMN doesn‚Äôt work because Brad said the data is mixed!‚Äù
‚ÄúResveratrol is a scam!‚Äù
No nuance, no context, just Stanfield-flavored spoonfuls of cherry-picked caution.

Let‚Äôs be honest‚ÄîBrad has the epistemological depth of a kiddie pool. Like most GPs, he‚Äôs trained to follow rules, not challenge them. Creativity? Risk-taking? Paradigm shifts? Nope. Just nice, linear, protocol says do this medicine. Science as a spreadsheet, not a process.

You know what‚Äôs safe?
	‚Ä¢	Studying a well-known drug like rapamycin in a tightly controlled, low-dose trial.
	‚Ä¢	Saying ‚Äúmore research is needed‚Äù at the end of every video.
	‚Ä¢	Only endorsing supplements you just so happen to be selling.
That‚Äôs real bravery.

Meanwhile, Sinclair‚Äôs working on reversing the biological age of cells. Like, literally turning back the clock. Will it all work? Who knows. But at least he‚Äôs doing something that isn‚Äôt just repackaging magnesium and making passive-aggressive YouTube thumbnails.

Here‚Äôs the difference:
Sinclair is out in the wild, getting bloodied in the arena, trying to move science forward.
Brad‚Äôs in the bleachers, munching his own brand of multivitamins, whispering ‚Äútsk tsk‚Äù whenever someone tries too hard.

So unless you‚Äôre contributing something more than parroting Stanfield‚Äôs curated mediocrity, maybe cool it with the ‚Äúfraud‚Äù accusations.

You don‚Äôt need to love Sinclair. You just need to understand that science isn‚Äôt tidy, linear, or free of ego. But the people taking risks‚Äîflawed, messy, human‚Äîare the ones who actually move things forward.

The rest? They just monetize hindsight.



TL;DR:
David Sinclair isn‚Äôt a fraud. He‚Äôs a legit, high-impact scientist who‚Äôs taken big risks and made real contributions.
Brad Stanfield critiques him while selling his own supplements, distorting evidence, and offering the most vanilla, cautious takes possible.
He‚Äôs not a fraud either‚Äîbut he‚Äôs a safe, curated brand masquerading as objective truth.
If you think that makes Sinclair the villain, you might be confusing ‚Äúnuance‚Äù with ‚Äúwhat my favorite influencer told me.‚Äù",2025-04-02 09:15:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jpkb5b/david_sinclair_is_a_fraud_thats_cute_let_me/

I'm not into the whole 'eating clean' movement, but for those who are - what actually motivates you to eat healthy?

For many, it's about maintaining the right shape - which is a good reason. 

But, is there a different reason? Please don't say longevity, because no diet regimen is proven to increase lifespan so far

I just completed the Prolon fast and I want to stick to a healthy diet for health and longevity, and hopefully lost some weight. I've have more than one ""wake-up call"" and I know I need to take charge of my health. But I am struggling!!! I am realizing just how addicted I am to all kinds of junk. It's really, really hard to not eat it and I find myself questioning my choice to give up unhealthy foods over and over. One example, I was a bar/grill/restaurant for a kids party tonight and I found myself wishing that I was having a couple beers and a plate of fries and mozzarella sticks or something, like grilled chicken sandwich, whatever... I couldn't STOP THINKING ABOUT IT! I started to feel really bad and almost kind of sad. Also when I got home my family was eating generic brand tortilla chips and cheese dip and chocolate bars! It's like I just want to join them, but I am unhealthy and I need to avoid this kind of junk food. It's crazy how driven I am to eat unhealthy food and I think it's ruining my life. And to make it harder my family is totally not on board. It's me alone trying to be healthy and avoid junk and it just feels completely overwhelming and a little sad.

**Brain aging shows nonlinear transitions, suggesting a midlife ‚Äúcritical window‚Äù for metabolic intervention**

*Age-related cognitive decline is associated with metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory changes, making it challenging to distinguish primary causes from secondary (downstream) effects. This study demonstrates that brain aging follows a specific progression, with the first stage occurring in middle age and coinciding with increased insulin resistance. Moreover, we show that brain areas that age fastest are also those most vulnerable to neuronal insulin resistance. Importantly, we find that administering ketones, which can fuel neurons while bypassing insulin resistance, reverses brain aging effects. However, this intervention is only effective when provided early enough for neurons to remain viable. These findings contribute to our understanding of brain aging mechanisms and suggest neurometabolic strategies for targeted early intervention in preventing age-related cognitive decline.*",2025-03-30 02:06:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jn2bil/thoughts_on_new_study_revealing_cognitive/

I usually do keto for about 2-3 months every few years to loose a bit of weight. Usually I'll lose about 15-20lbs in that time which Im fairly happy with. Unfortunately with my current Keto cycle I haven't lose any weight in 3 weeks.  
  
I do weekly meal preps so my day to day meals look like, 2 eggs, 2 pork sausages, bacon bits and some mayo for breakfast. For lunch I have about 4 ounce of chicken breast, half a cup of broccoli, cheddar cheese and I pan cook the chicken in butter. Ill also had about half a table spoon of MCT oil on the chicken. Dinner is usually 4 ounces of salmon, tilapia, or more chicken with some lettuce and some dressing. Ill also snack on some pork grinds and guac pre dinner. Also I drink about a gallon of water a day.  
  
I am feeling the affects of ketosis and I've started fasting 16 hours this week (finish eating at 8pm and fast until 12pm) and Im able to do it with minimum hunger.

I‚Äôm on my third week of keto, and I‚Äôm just about to reach my first weight loss goal (of many). I‚Äôm very happy about the change, and I feel like I‚Äôm getting into a good rhythm of meals. 
However!! I‚Äôm a married mom of three kids: 17, 14 and 10. While my husband and kids are supportive and loving that I‚Äôm taking care of myself, they are not joining in. Totally fine, and for the most part not a problem. Today though, they baked the most delicious smelling pie, and I nearly lost my mind. 

Intellectually, I can observe myself and think: wow, look at the strong mental hold that carbs have had on you your whole life! The cravings! The insane power that has driven you to self sabotage for more than 40 years! It‚Äôs truly an addiction, and I‚Äôve never realized it more than today. 

In the moment, though, it was all I could do not to gnaw my own hand. I took a few bites of my leftovers from dinner (even though I really wasn‚Äôt hungry at all), cracked open a sparkling water and then brushed my teeth. 

I‚Äôm grateful to be heading towards health. So many goals that I‚Äôm chasing: blood pressure control, lower cholesterol, fitness and longevity. The keto diet is really so easy when it‚Äôs just me around, but so much harder when there‚Äôs muffins on the counter, warm pie on the table and cookies in the jar.

I posted for ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù, but I truly know what I need to do. It was hard tonight, but I‚Äôm glad I stuck to it. Here‚Äôs to one more day and another pound down.",2024-01-08 04:58:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/191d104/solo_keto_in_a_house_full_of_baked_goods/
1894hbo,keto,What did I do wrong?,"I went on strict Keto, for 4 weeks got into Ketosis and lost weight. Carbs down to under 20g per day. 

I felt good. Happy.

Went for annual physical and told doc I was on Keto. 

Without hesitation he said your cholesterol (which was above range last two years, but he didn‚Äôt try to medicate) are ‚Äúall definitely going up, as everyone I‚Äôve seen try it has the same response‚Äù

Blood test back and its gone the wrong was on Total Cholesterol. From 232 to 278 (range is under 200)

HDL dropped for the second year from 68 to 64 to 60 (range is 40 or less)

LDL(the ‚Äúbad cholesterol‚Äù right?) jumped from 150 to 203.

Triglycerides are down from 74 to 58 (also have fallen for for the 4th straight year, but by far biggest drop appears to have been while on keto)

ALT or alanine transaminase. increased by more than double from 39 to 72.

I googled it and its an enzyme found mostly in the liver. An ALT test measures the amount of ALT in the blood. _When liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream. High levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of a liver injury or disease._

I am worried about this‚Ä¶. liver damage and I gave up alchohol (not that I drink much at all as part of adopting Keto diet. I doubt I‚Äôll ever have more than 10 per year again, and maybe closer to 0.

I read a lot online,read labels ‚Äòreligiously‚Äô cut the carbs to 20g a day., exercise (cardio + lifting) and been on 16:8 fasting‚Ä¶.

 _What did I do so wrong?_ Dr. says it is ‚Äúalways‚Äù the Keto diet that does this and maybe my family history of high cholesterol‚Äî they‚Äôre all on Lipitor with tiny cholesterol now.  He says I‚Äôm next if i dont cut the animal fats. I hear how well Keto works for many online‚Ä¶ 

What did I do wrong?

Maybe not enough leafy green vegetables? (though I had some about everyday) ‚Äîwas trying to keep carbs down. IDK, but worried about the ALT reading and risk of liver injury. 

Also feel quite stupid, for striking out like this. 51M I am/was trying to take health and longevity very seriously.

t7r5oh,keto,Keto: All I know is I know nothing,"Hi,
I've been on Keto for about more than 2 years, I feel great, lost weight, got healthier etc. Since I started till now I read plenty of books on Keto, watched hundreds of videos, follow all the most respected doctors. Learned a lot I thought. Started to spread the Keto word whenever asked or when confronted by people that had no clue about keto. I was very confident that I had been awakened from the disinformation in nutrition most of the people had, including doctors. Topics like the Carbohydrate insulin model, High LDL is no trouble only small dense are the problematic ones, you can eat fat till you are full, don't eat too much protein or it will kick you out of ketosis, if insulin is high you won't burn fat, avoid grains, fructose, dairy, eat red meat, organ meat, vegan is not sustentable, etc, etc.
But everything changed, I started to notice that lots of the Keto gurus, begin to adapt what they once said like really solid statements, things like you don't have to be on keto for ever, you have to go in and out, be flexible, eat mostly protein and it won't kicked you out of ketosis, don't overdo fats, etc etc.
I also allowed my self the chance to view information from other doctors that can debunk every single thing that we think is valid information. I really want to have the most accurate information without dogmas, but it's really getting very difficult. We don't have a one  rock solid thing, only are personal experiences. For every study there is another one that says the opposite, or the study was on rats, or It wasn't very long or it's a epidemiology study, or the problem is the healthy user bias, etc.
You might argue that science is like this, that arriving to solid conclusions in nutrition is very hard, but it hits me in the head every time I read a paper that debunks are knowledge.
We don't know about longevity, we don't have 100 years old keto people to confirm are hipothesis, we think we are in the correct path but we really don't know. 
Hope better studies arrive in the near future to help us have a better understanding and best practice of are nutrition.

qa1cnw,keto,Protein...,"Greetings all.  I am a 61 yo male, 70""/165 lbs.  I have been eating a keto diet since spring of 2017.  Decided to eat in this fashion after reading some of Thomas Seyfried's work amongst others relative to potential anti-cancer effect of decreasing carbohydrate.  Lost about 15 pounds along the way, but that was not my objective.

Getting to my question...  The one remaining question mark relative to my approach to keto is level of protein intake.  I have evolved from eating around .6g/kg based on some of the early research I did (in particular Ron Rosedale and some of his comments relative to longevity) and felt very good.  Over time, being exposed to other sources of information, I am currently eating approximately 2.2 g/kg lean body mass based on among other sources the FAQ... and again, I feel pretty good, no noticable difference.  I recently saw another video by Dr. Pradip Jamnadas, whose opinion I respect, where he is recommending ,6 g/Kg (I think it was actually .3g/lb which I am doing a rough translation here) being very clear that we need no more.  And he was addressing an older audience.

So my question is, in the face of these varying sets of guidance from relatively well thought out and what I perceive as knowledgeable perspectives, what is your target protein intake and what logic process did you follow to get there?",2021-10-17 15:49:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/qa1cnw/protein/
pnu4t7,keto,How much weight loss comes with (close to) maintenance calories?,"Hello all,    

Here's my deal: I have a lot of weight to lose (maybe 80-90 lb?), and I want to limit it to around 2lb/week to minimise loose skin.  In order to do this, I've started doing 48 hour fasts every week because (apparently) it increases autophagy and also just generally has longevity benefits.  Something that makes fasting easier is to be low carb or keto, so I decided screw it I'll do keto too.  Have already started.    

So basically I'm trying to figure out how much weight ketosis helps us lose without a calorie deficit, and I'll adjust my calorie deficit based on that.  As cool as it would be to do 3lb+ per week, I just don't want to risk the higher chance of loose skin.  FWIW I'll be upping my calories on non fast days to account for the fasts, so we're talking total calories per week as a measurement

m1unuu,keto,"Problems with longevity and sugar cravings, cant get rid of them (much more detail in the post)","Hello. For a long time i have been trying to stay on keto long term, but i have always failed, going no further than 30 days maximum. However, when i did stay on keto properly i saw great results in terms of weight loss, mental health and stable energy levels. I mostly contribute this to the fact that i did OMAD every day with no problem, as i am using Concerta medicine for my ADHD which completely eliminated my hunger for the whole day. My problem is not the food, the fasting and the carb restrictions that generally comes with a ketogenic diet, in fact 95% of the time spent on keto was effortless as i am concerned, and it felt completely natural for me to stay on such a low carb diet for a long period of time.

My problem is the extreme sugar cravings that kick in generally sometimes in the weekends, as my mind gets completely fixated on having a cosy evening watching a movie whilst eating candy and eating pizza (an example). I have always had a sweet tooth, and i cant seem to eliminate it. This is what annoys me so much with the ketogenic diet. It is perfect for me and feels natural almost all of the time, but the fact that i cant cheat just once in a while without feeling completely ill and depressed after having a cheat day is whats stopping me from actually committing to it long term.

Now, i know that there may be several solutions to this, and it may seem weak and low effort of me to not soldier though these moments of personal weakness. Believe me, i have tried different methods to combat this; eating keto friendly snacks at planned moments, drinking sugar free sodas, eating a variety of proper ketogenic foods and getting large amounts of water and sodium throughout the day.

Yet, the sugar cravings always come back crawling in the background, and it is extremely mentally draining when they come. When the cravings come they stay there for several hours, no matter what i do. For me, food and comfort eating has always been mentally relaxing and rewarding, and that does not mean that i do it like every other day. Its just knowing that once in a while i can go all out and have a small feast that makes longevity a possible factor for me. However, cheating and keto is not something thats compatible for long term commitment, and i know this from experience and reading a lot about other peoples experience with the diet.

What made me write this post is essentially the last method that i think may work, but it sounds so radical. As many of you might know, sugar alcohols may stimulate cravings, and i think that may be whats holding me back. I say this knowingly; if i KNEW that eating strict keto and totally avoiding fake sugars would kill my cravings, i would have no problem sticking to the diet. No problem. Yet it sounds so radical to cut out sugar alcohols even though i know that it might be the solution to my problem. I really want to stay on this diet for long period of time, as i know that it makes me feel great in all aspects. Its just that i do not believe that cutting out all foods that may stimulate these cravings will work (foods containing sugar alcohols), so i do not know if its worth to be this strict if it is not going to yield results. Food has always been important to me, and what notion i have gathered among people who have done keto long term successfully is that they start to just view food as fuel, and not comfort. Im gonna be honest, to be it seems that if you want to do keto long term, you HAVE to change the way you view food if you want to achieve a life free of cravings, and it seems too mentally painful and radical to do that.

Im sure some people on here has had this problem in some sort of way, so i would greatly appreciate any personal experiences or ""tips"" that might help me. Im sorry if this post was a bit messy, and please feel free to ask me any questions if it would help understanding my situation better.

jvajee,keto,2 mental strategies that have kept me in the game,"(29F, SW 212, CW 199, GW 150) I am currently on week 7 of keto and am still completely unwavered as far as wanting to cheat or quit. I‚Äôve tried keto 4 or 5 times in the past and have never been able to make it past 3 weeks. Usually my downfall would be having a cheat day and then never returning to keto again. 

I was slowly gaining with my peak being at Christmas time 2019 at 216. I knew I needed to do something and tracking calories just wasn‚Äôt working. My appetite was dragging me and I would always end up going over the calories. I was very hesitant to try keto again because of how many times I‚Äôve failed in the past, but this time I decided to make some mental promises with myself before starting. These have tremendously helped me so I hope they help some of you if you are considering trying again or doing it for the first time. 

1. No cheat days/long haul. I decided from the get go that I wasn‚Äôt going to have cheat days at all for the exception of thanksgiving day and Christmas Day. Previously I would ‚Äúschedule‚Äù cheat days every two weeks. Also if I were to find myself accidentally kicked out of keto I wouldn‚Äôt say screw it and go out and buy all the things I‚Äôve been wanting to eat. I‚Äôve had one day where I was kicked out from eating Indian food with sugary sauce. I decided to treat it like any other keto day and didn‚Äôt indulge even though I knew I wasn‚Äôt in keto. The next day my body was right back in it without any carb ‚Äúhangover‚Äù. I also fully accepted the fact that I would be in this for months, going well into 2021 and maybe 2022. I wouldn‚Äôt stop until I hit my goal weight. This leads to #2...

2. Rewarding myself is doing what‚Äôs best for my body. Doing keto again and sticking to it has completely changed the way I think about food and it‚Äôs opened my eyes to the horrible relationship I had with food. I consistently have to remind myself that rewarding my taste buds is inferior to rewarding my body. Taste only lasts for minutes, sometimes seconds, but eating healthy food lasts for years, and affects so much more than just longevity (energy, mood, stress). I figured that I‚Äôve had 29 years of eating whatever, choosing instant satisfaction over an exponentially greater satisfaction, that I owe my body this. I choose to be positive about the things that I do get to eat, which is a lot, and it‚Äôs yummy! Instead of dreaming about food that I miss eating I think how good the food I do get to eat is. And I‚Äôm much more connected to what my body is actually feeling. I.e. is this carb cravings or am I just hungry/thirsty? I think this has mentally strengthened me and I find myself just squashing any sort of deprecating thought before it even gets to finish...leading to pretty much not struggling at all. Like I‚Äôm actually amazed at how easy it is, I just had to make up my mind completely about the reality of it. 

Some other tips:
Drink lots of water... This will help with cravings but it will make you feel good overall. I put mio in pretty much all the water I drink and it helps me drink more. 

Electrolytes... I just bought a potassium/magnesium supplement on amazon and it works well. Good for the RLS too! Don‚Äôt quit because you feel bad or sick, just take electrolytes. 

Cold showers... I‚Äôm thoroughly convinced this has strengthened me mentally. I actually am excited to do hard things now. Google about why it‚Äôs great if you don‚Äôt know.",2020-11-16 17:10:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jvajee/2_mental_strategies_that_have_kept_me_in_the_game/
ildyz1,keto,First Post: Data snapshot after 4 weeks,"I'm new to this community, but I'm impressed with the support here so far and excited to keep myself motivated. I thought by sharing my experience I might help others, as the individuals here have helped me so far!

[Here's a snapshot of my current progress.](https://imgur.com/a/cu3RnUM)

My health situation is far more modest than many others', but is no less important in my eyes. My family medical history is rife with metabolic disorders, as well as psychological disorders, so my goals have been far more oriented towards longevity than the aesthetic. Starting out, I was TOFI; my starting weight was 187 (my max recorded weight was 197 about a year and a half ago), with the majority of that weight being around my middle. I've had moderate success previously on a lazy low-carb CICO diets that were heavily focused towards increased exercise and weight training rather than diet-focused. In one notable attempt, I had an *extremely* lean low-carb, low-fat diet that ended after I had an optical migraine after a workout. Obviously, I wouldn't be here if that had stuck; like many, during this pandemic I saw a precipitous increase of weight, especially around my middle. Not being able to exercise has been a huge bane on my health, and the increased stress has generally sapped my self discipline (ice cream and beer were my go-to de-stressors at the beginning of the pandemic).

After boning up on the literature, I decided to go all-in on a VLCHF, with an emphasis on diet over exercise. Ketoadaptation has a number of alleged benefits that I felt could help my situation, including; mental health (pandemic stress), immune-system resiliency (COVID risk), and inflammation (a severe COVID reaction). These attracted me to keto as a nutritional therapy, even beyond the weight-loss effects that had initially started me looking. As my main motivation to stay on the wagon, I started the spreadsheet to keep track of my progress. I admittedly went overboard: tracking ketones and blood glucose twice a day is ***not*** necessary, and frankly pretty expensive (I have since cut back to just once a day), but I was curious to see some objective measures of my experience and how the many different factors related to one another. 

My experience so far has been quite interesting! Starting with the least interesting: 

I've lost 14.4 pounds over the last 28 days at an average rate of 0.5lbs per day. You can see in the graph that most of this occurred over the first week and a half and during/after my initial 3 day fast. At the current rate, I could hit my goal weight of 160lbs at the end of september at the earliest, but a more realistic estimate would put me somewhere between then and mid-october. Time is not of particular concern to me, but the degree and speed of the weight loss could help me tune my caloric intake. I particularly did not want to loose too much too fast. A 2lbs/week rate was/is my target, as that is a common reference rate.

My average GKI is extremely low. I suspect this is most likely due to my relative good health and my higher-than-average caloric deficit of 25%. My average serum Ketone level is between 2mmol/L and 5mmol/L, which is certainly on the high end. I haven't found many published target ranges, especially for those seeking to loose weight and under IF and OMAD parameters. On OMAD days, it is extremely difficult to get to my 25% reduction of 1500 kcal, and on these days especially my GKI is typically below 1. I typically eat until I hit my protein goal and until i'm satiated, but I have had to make adjustments as I go because I did not think I was getting enough nutrition. I understand the general risks of higher deficits, but I am conducting this a bit like an N=1 study on myself. Unfortunately, I don't have baseline measurements of BMR or lean mass percentages, but I suspect that as long as I hit general nutritional requirements of protein, my fat stores will make up the caloric deficit without much impacting metabolic rate, so long as I stay fat adapted. So far this has remained true; my energy level on most days is extremely high. I have periodic ""breaks"" from my deficit to eat at maintenance to help maintain my BMR as best I can.

My carb intake is loosely related to my GKI, offset by about a day, but even as I approach 70 grams of carbohydrates, I generally am not kicked out of ketosis. My running theory currently is that my glycogen stores have been sufficiently depleted that even modest carb intake goes straight to glycogen stores and used overnight. I had a canoe trip on the 29th with coworkers with modest low-carb beer consumption over the entire day, and even that did not seam to pull me significantly out of ketosis. I may test this a bit moving forward to see if I can reach a more balanced level of ketosis.

&#x200B;

I generally feel fantastic. I haven't had this level of mental clarity in quite a long time. I'm starting to need a lot less sleep, and I have been dreaming far more, and my dreams are far more vivid. I wake up at my alarm and do not feel the need to go back asleep (though I like sleep, so sometimes I still try anyway). My only odd symptom has been needing to pee in the night. I have been drinking quite a lot of water and supplementing probably more electrolytes than are needed, so this needs adjustment I think. Otherwise, this lifestyle has vastly improved my health and outlook. I'm not sure if I've finally just adjusted to the pandemic, or if I can attribute my more positive outlook to what and when and how much i've been eating. Hopefully once I hit my goal weight, the gyms will be safe again and I can focus on mobility and lean mass. I'm curious how I will do eating at my maintenance or even a surplus will work, since even now I struggle hitting my calorie goals. More fat? probably.

Hopefully this helps someone else, maybe even someone who is worried or skeptical of LCHF nutrition!

g6kqvt,keto,Transitioning to keto as a bodybuilder,"Hello guys! I am a guy who has been primarily focusing on building muscle for years and have had ~30-40% of my macros being carbs as fuel for my muscle. My goal is to transition to keto macros with ~10% of carb intake since my goal is now overall health & longevity, and reduce my allergic reactions & inflammation from carbs while maintaining my muscle & strength, but not necessarily get bigger muscles. However I am afraid that this shift will be a massive shock for my body, since all my muscle are used to getting daily carb fuel. My question is, will my muscle eventually start utilizing energy from fat & gluconeogenisis? And should I do a slow transition to keto macros or start off fully right away? Do I risk losing all my hard-earned muscle?
And how much protein do I need?
I am not a huge steroid-taking bodybuilder, more like a hobby level natural lifter who has been lifting weights seriously for ~5 years.

fqg0jg,keto,Keto and changing/saving my life,"I‚Äôve exercised for my whole life but never to a crazy extent, sport at school and martial arts, I did some weight lifting as well so I was a pretty solid boy under all my fat; I weighed 110kg 2 years ago, I was only 16, I wasn‚Äôt happy with how I felt at all. I didn‚Äôt want to get to this point, I didn‚Äôt mean to get to that point. 

I was born with a Ventricular Septum Defect (VSD), a whole between the two bottom chambers of your heart, the parts that send blood to your lungs and body. I had a surgery when I was 3 to fix it and I was one of the first in Australia to have this specific surgery and there was some problems with plugging the whole, this meant for my entire life I‚Äôd to some extent be sending unoxygenated to all my muscle and body. This caused me to have asthma and to the point where basic running could make me pass out in a 200m race. Along with having lots of trouble exercising I had to be on steroids for the early part of my life and that doesn‚Äôt really give you a good shot at gaining weight properly. 

I can remember always wanting to lose weight but everything I tried from what was recommended to us that was healthy did nothing, I lost 10kg from straight calorie restriction, great, till I hit a stressful point in my life yr 10 in highschool, ASD and just the strangest kid, homeless at the time I just stress ate and gained it back. I was pretty sad about it and then in yr 11 I met my new math teacher who told me about the keto diet. I have Aspergers and my favourite thing is to know how things work, so I delved into all the pubmed studies I spent countless days learning, and then I did it, I‚Äôve lost 30kg, I‚Äôve lost my asthma, my immune system is amazing, I get less skin rashes, I have no bowel troubles, there‚Äôs amazing mechanisms behind these things.

It inspired me to go to uni, I wanted to do engineering when I was younger then I realised that the human body is the most intricate machine so I‚Äôd learn how that works. I‚Äôm studying a bachelor of pharmacy and my GPA is good enough to one day be able to do medicine. I wanna help people who struggled like me.

I started being able to exercise, more and more. Cardio was always kept light, 15minute max normally and just loads of resistance training. As everyone knows with what‚Äôs going on in the world gyms have closed. So all of a sudden I thought well I feel fitter, I don‚Äôt have asthma anymore, my hole in my heart had closed up when I was 15, I‚Äôm good to try running. Day 1 - 5km run, day 2 - 7km, day 3-5 - 10km, well day 6 and I some how ran a half marathon, next to no training. I am incredibly interesting in optimising the human body and brain as well as longevity so I do many other things in my daily life to promote these things, so I‚Äôm sure these had an impact on the ability but keto is the thing that made me reach this point. I thank it so much.

Remember guys anything is possible with a bit of discipline, time and effort.

Fast forward to April 15th and I tried keto. By July 1st I was down to 252. For some reason I decided that was enough and I ate and drank throughout the summer and got back to 275.

dtiqnn,keto,Intermittent fasting + Keto. Thoughts?,"I recently posted about my success in using keto for nootropic style effects (focus, energy, longevity.)  Although i didn't start for weight loss i will say my body fat levels have decreased drastically.   I recently decided to try other methods along side of a ketogenic diet to enhance its effects.  I came across intermittent fasting as a good addition.  

Although intermittent fasting added a little bit more focus, energy and longevity to my workday; it was not as drastic as the initial switch to Keto. This is not completely surprising since they both take effect because of ketone production. 

The surprising part is the increase in muscle production.  I did not switch my workouts or diet, only the window i would eat in. (6 fed, 18 fasted)  I'm guessing this is due to a boost in testosterone from the intermittent fasting.  

Thoughts or recommendations on other methods should test for more body and mind altering results?",2019-11-08 17:33:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/dtiqnn/intermittent_fasting_keto_thoughts/
drsoqo,keto,Love my Keto diet. Struggling to maintain my weight. Tweaks??,"Been keto for a year and a half, and keep to about a six-hour eating window every day.  I tried to go by my *appetite* judging how much to eat generally.

That sense alone has been failing me.  Got on the scale today and I lost another 5 pounds. I'm already at a pretty ideal body composition and I'm a little bit at a loss as to why my appetite alone can't drive me to keep at the same weight.  In fact the only time that I feel a sense of great hunger is when I drift off my very strict keto discipline because of some social event ....and a few hours later I'll get hungry again.  Otherwise it's standard hunger and I am sated.


I am keto for longevity and mental clarity, and the clarity part is so amazing to me that  I don't want to get on the carb coaster at *all*...but it almost seems like I'm going to have to start forcing high calorie keto friendly food into my into my mouth to keep enough fat on my body so that I'm not just muscle and bones.

I truly am not complaining that this gold is too heavy... I'm hoping that I'm not the only person that experiences this, someone will be able to help me understand how to put a little bit more me onto me without having to resort to calorie counting.  

Should I open my eating window more?
Should I start making fat bomb cookies?
Should I start buying bigger steaks, or put more butter on the steak?
Should I keep a bag of bacon with me at all times?

I weight train 5 days a week for about 20 minutes each day in 3 short session, and it keeps me in good shape, but it also burns a good bit of energy.

**Abstract**

Calorie restriction, without malnutrition, has beenshown to increase lifespan and is associated with ashift away from glycolysis toward beta-oxidation.The objective of this study was to mimic this meta-bolic shift using low-carbohydrate diets and to deter-mine the influence of these diets on longevity andhealthspan in mice. C57BL/6 mice were assigned toa ketogenic, low-carbohydrate, or control diet at12 months of age and were either allowed to livetheir natural lifespan or tested for physiological func-tion after 1 or 14 months of dietary intervention. Theketogenic diet (KD) significantly increased medianlifespan and survival compared to controls. In agedmice, only those consuming a KD displayed preser-vation of physiological function. The KD increasedprotein acetylation levels and regulated mTORC1signaling in a tissue-dependent manner. This studydemonstrates that a KD extends longevity andhealthspan in mice.",2019-09-29 14:50:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/daw3gm/a_ketogenic_diet_extends_longevity_and/
d7rnlh,keto,[Discussion] Thoughts on John Rose and particularly this video in regards to animal protein?,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Ye6t5r5V8

I want everyone to watch this video and then discuss. John Rose preaches veganism and more importantly, fruit. He understands Ketosis is a good way to lose weight, but he calls it an emermency mode that we arent supposed to be in, instead, he eats fruits and vegetables and makes sure he gets his carb intake. He proposes that fruit sugar isn't really the enemy, but instead the protein that we combine with the sugar is the enemy. This guy is insanely smart, I've watched a lot of his videos and he has been studying about weight loss and diets for over 30 years. He has known about fasting since forever and preaches no solid food vacations to get rid of the toxins. He really knows his stuff, like really really fucking knows the science, so this isnt the typical vegan crazy from not eating protein. 

Honestly, dietary needs are something we don't know a lot of, and in my quest for knowledge, I am truly trying to understand what we should be putting into our body. Now, the best I have come up with is that we are all different, so you need to find the food that makes you feel the best, but the bad news about this is that even though you might feel good afterwards (energy, mentally) we still don't know what is really going on in our body and how it might be damaging ourselves, think longevity.

The best knowledge that we have is that processed sugar and foods are bad. 


But I bring this video to your attention because this guy seems to be really sound in his logic and more importantly his science, and Keto is insanely beneficial, a diet that can reverse diabetes and stop seizures as my vote for something that everyone should try. But the one thing about Keto that has always rubbed me the wrong way is the fact that you can't eat fruit.  

One of the comments in the video says it best, How can the most natural, abundant, simple, raw, and accessible food source on the planet have the exact same effect on the body as the processed sugar poison created by big business!?!
Something definitely off and missing with that logic.

And we know that cancer likes sugar, think Steve Jobs going fruitartian, dumb fuck didnt have the knowledge that we know now that going on a keto diet could have extended his years potentially, but the thing is though, how did his cancer appear in the first place. Maybe if he was a fruitartian/vegan to begin with he never would have gotten cancer in the first place. Maybe its all genetics...Anyways, discuss, this shit is interesting.",2019-09-22 15:08:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/d7rnlh/discussion_thoughts_on_john_rose_and_particularly/

cj6y6v,keto,Am I broken?,"Long read. A little background. In 2011, my sister was really sick. Doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with her. She hurt so bad you couldn't touch her. She couldn't eat right. She'd just throw it up. Doctors constantly said nothing is wrong medically. By 2013, my sister was so skinny, she looked anorexic. My mom had the idea to put her on a lettuce diet. My sister ate nothing but lettuce and water for almost a month and she transformed. My mom called me crying because my sister was having a good day and hugged my mom. And felt no pain. So they started adding foods back in every couple days. Vegetables, then fruits, then meats. My sister started to put weight back on and she was happy. She even went back to public school. And one day she ate a cookie and she was in almost unbearable pain. So my mom thought it must be gluten intolerance or celiac. So they got her tested and everything came back normal. She had also had allergy tests done. Found out she has a scallop allergy. But anyway, my mom demanded a retest. Still normal. During all of this, my whole family had changed our diet to match my sister's so she would feel good and not feel tempted to deviate from her experimental diet. I have always been heavy. I keep active enough that I never got gigantic. Working on a ranch helped. By 2016, my sis is normal. She also has done tons of research on diet still trying to find an answer when an alternative doctor suggested genetic testing. It came back with a major MTHFR mutation. I had noticed changes in my reactions to foods and while not as extreme as my sis, I would have reactions to the same food. Doc said ""Genetics! Am I right?"" She was really cool. So at this point (2018) we'd basically been on a paleo diet for about 6-7 years. My family looks great. I didn't change. I talked to doctors and they would say something along the lines of ""despite the number lisyed under weight, I was healthy."" So why couldn't I lose the weight? In 2017, i was ready to give up trying to be fit. I joined a fitness challenge, and while everyone around me drop 20+ lbs in 6 weeks, I barely managed 11. Last year I started hearing all these things about keto. I had been living a paleo lifestyle for so long, I figured all I needed to do was drop my carbs more. I did my research.  Figured out a game plan and started keto 2 months ago. I track my macros. I work hard at work and at home. Work Forest service and still around the ranch. In 2 months, I've barely lost 10 lbs! It is so discouraging to see so much success around me and not be able to join it. I always figured I didn't have much change because we ate relatively healthy before the initial diet changes in 2012/13. And I figured that even when I became more regimented during the fitness challenge I didn't change a lot other than scheduling my eating patterns and making my meal a little more balanced. But keto was supposed to kickstart the shock my body needed to get into gear. And the only benefits are energy longevity and clearer skin. Oh, and feeling less bloated.

Sorry for the extreme story and bouncing around. I am drained and hopeless that I will ever be the fit I want to be. I like the energy I have on keto, so I plan on sticking with it. And maybe over time, things will move along better, but now, it sucks. I just want to feel good about my body.",2019-07-29 05:35:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/cj6y6v/am_i_broken/
ce3ppx,keto,Does Keto Make Sense for Endurance Athletes?,"Hey all,

&#x200B;

First of all, thanks for putting together this fantastic community with all of it's great resources. I've just started researching Keto and this sub has been a great help. Unfortunately, I think I may come from a slightly different perspective than many of the studies and discussions I have found online.

&#x200B;

I'm a life-long endurance athlete, so I've never really put much thought into what I eat other than carbo-loading before big race or training days and bumping my protein intake after big workouts or when trying to put on muscle during off seasons. I recently developed a condition called Idiopathic Angioedema, which basically just means unexplainable, random swelling. It can be pretty debilitating when it occurs in my face and throat so I've been looking for ways to alter my long-term diet to hopefully limit the occurrence of these swelling outbreaks. I've been to several allergists, had all my blood work done extensively to rule out any allergies, illness or underlying conditions, and after coming out all clean, all of the doctor's have basically told me this is something I may never get an explanation or answer for.

&#x200B;

Long-story short, I've started doing a lot of research on health and longevity and have started reading and learning a lot about Intermittent Fasting and Keto. Unfortunately, most of the information I can find on these diets revolves around weight loss and I can't seem to find much information about the viability of these diets for long-term health.

&#x200B;

Are any of you using Keto as a long-term diet, not to lose weight, but just for overall health and longevity? Do you know of any studies that have been done on the long-term effects of these diets for people who are not overweight?

Particularly for me, I've been keto for a long time and I don't have weight to loose. When I say I'm on keto diet people hear 'diet' and start freaking out. I'm on the low end of healthy BMI, has been for years. I eat keto for health and longevity benefits, and I don't ever plan to go back to carbs. 

Too bad the word diet came to mean temporarily change of eating habits, not a long term way of eating. 
What made me think of it now is people can say I'm vegetarian or I'm kosher, and that implies consistent, long term dietary preference. I've been eating ketogenic diet for 9 years, which is close to a third of my life. That is long term, sustainable, and I don't plan on changing it. 

Maybe partially at fault is the recent surge of popularity of keto for weight loss, people know the diet better as very efficient weight loss tool and less as long term way if eating.

My cooking skills are basic. I usually east meat with some veggies and a starch. I'm intimidated by a plant based diet since I don't have much time or skill in the kitchen. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for a simple cook book or guide to get started? Something geared more towards  a strength diet instead of losing weight?

40lz8s,vegetarian,About to break up with a girl whose parents oppose being vegetarian,"I've dated her for almost 6 months now, 3 months overseas webcam and 3 months in real life.

It's always been an ongoing issue for her parents that I am vegetarian here in China. It was minor at first, but it's gotten to the point where I am about to break up with her because of it. He thinks it's because I'm vegetarian that I got the flu for a month in China. (Where it's blatantly obvious that it's because I'm not used to the freezing weather here at all and the polluted air) I was never sick like this back overseas in Australia. And therefore thinks that if I don't eat meat it won't make me able to take care of her daughter as well as producing a healthy baby. In actual fact, since I have turned vegetarian I have gotten a lot healthier than before and I gained an average body weight, whereas I was underweight my whole life.


Her dad is a doctor from the army (so he has studied nutrition) and a control freak that looks like he is always anxious about something. His brother is 2 years older than him but looks 10 years younger and has a lot more carefree of a personality. At home her dad frequently yells at his daughter and wife and wants them to do what he wants. She had two bf before and they both had trouble with her dad and it was because of that that she broke up with them. So the third time he is naturally more hesitant to.

My main reason going vegetarian is that I care too much about the animals being treated as machines; that I want a longer life; and that it's good for my karma. I always feel guilty about eating meat nowadays. I fully recognize that he isn't respecting my lifestyle choice, beliefs and if he wasn't her parent I would just honestly tell him to f*** off and leave it at that. But I guess it's more complicated than that and I feel that if I pretend to go along with him and eat meat, etc 1. it feels pretentious and not me, 2. he will feel like he has control over me and there might be more unreasonable requests later on. I mean do I really have to change my beliefs and moral values because of some asshole?

Just had an hour convo with her dad last night, he said these:

- Killing plants is the same thing as killing meat because cells form all living things; and that we are always killing things by breathing in cells every second. 
A. I told him the common answer how plants don't scream when you cut it in half. To which he said how do you know because they also have nervous systems etc. 

- If you don't kill it, it's not your concern.
A. If it ends on my plate I will feel guilty about it regardless how it got there.

- Chinese bodies are different to western bodies, so the research about longevity and health etc are null and void.
A. I didn't know how to answer that because it seems absurd, I told him to provide the evidence before I will believe that. 

- Being vegetarian will make you stupid because protein cells in the brain will be lacking.
A. I told him that the most genius people were lifetime vegetarians or tried out being a vegetarian. I.e. Einstein, Da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Isaac Newton. They made the conscious choice of being vegetarian, it's not that those people will decide this argument alone though. Also there is an article and news on that suggesting research about how vegetarians are smarter by statistical research. He doesn't believe in the internet and thinks anyone can write a silly article.

Obviously being the person he is, he didn't listen to me and my points were invalid in his eyes.

So yeah I don't know what to do. I still love the girl but his parents are pretty messed up in my book. Maybe it's a different culture thing. They think I'm very stubborn not changing after they tried to persuade me so many times to. And so today they want her to break up with me because I'm not willing to listen to them. I honestly even compromised eating fish and crab with them at dinner, but he wants me to eat meat and go the whole way...

What to do? Is it really worth it?...

**Edit**: added more info about her dad.

**Edit2**: Thanks for all replies so far! I am thinking about saying this to her dad: 

People in China aren't ethical. In my experience in China, it's common for people to litter, push in front of people, smoke right next to you without your consent, take the seats next to you without asking. Is that the right thing to do? To people in china yes, because it's a commonly accepted behaviour, it may be socially correct -- but otherwise it is not correct in any way. So similarly, it's socially accepted for people to eat meat without giving another thought about the animals. Therefore, I expect you to not understand why you should respect my ethical beliefs.

But honestly people have different moral and ethical beliefs. You said that we eat cells every second by breathing and therefore shouldn't care so much about eating meat. Ok but that's your own belief.

My belief is that the animals have souls and are capable of emotions, intelligence, and they wouldn't flee in terror if they wouldn't want to be killed. Plants do not because I believe they are nature's gift to all and want to share themselves to living beings.

As you said, science has yet to come so far as to be at the point where we know everything about the universe. So similarly, you do not know everything and what you said is your own belief. Not a fact. End of story.",2016-01-12 10:33:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/40lz8s/about_to_break_up_with_a_girl_whose_parents/

1md632z,bodyweightfitness,Using Gadgets and Do-dads...,"I'll attempt my best at brevity. I have decided for me personally to take time away from lifting weights the way that I way doing it. I was primarily doing a lot of barbell clean and pressing with some occational squatting (back/ front). I'm 42, work in a psych ward and have milage. My decision to come back to primarily bodyweight is multifacitied. Longevity, consistancy, reliability and self sustainability factor into the decision to primarily use bodyweight. I am not brand new; I read the wiki - in it's various forms. I also have ripped off some of the recommended routine. I have several books, ""Get Strong"" by the Kavadlo brothers (I guess mostly Al Kavadlo) is one of my favorite. Overcoming Gravity should be retitled Overwhelming information. 

Now I am returning to bodyweight fitness, and I have collected gadgets and do-dads along the way. I have a Nordic curl door attachment, some power press floor board push up ""machine"". I have a multitude of pull up bars (outside and door framers). Rings for dips and rows. Wedges for squats. I just bought a Roman Chair - its been a new challenge. The Ab wheel has turned into one of my favorite things. Bands for assisted rep chasers.

While I do like a nice physique, and hypertrophy would probably always be a goal of mine: I feel like simply progressing my movements is more of a priority goal. An example would be dips. I started rotating ring dips in 2 weeks ago. I started with holds and bands, then did unassited ladders (1,2,3, 1,2,3, 1,2,3). My last workout included a straight 3x3. 

I have been trying to switch to a push pull legs schedule. My days are not 9-5, they are not consistant. With the Push Pull Leg split, I would be able to work out 4 days in a row, or be able to take off rest days and still fit a small short workout in during a 4 day - 60hr work week that I'm practically living in the hospital (just for fun info/ there is a pull up bar in the basement, but not a lot of places to hang stuff from on a psych ward). 

My current split was 6 Days 1) Dip & push up focus with 3x8 ab wheel. 2) pull up (3x6-8 currently), underhand row 3x8, roman chair 3x5. 3) nordic curls 3x5. wedge squats 4x10 or 4 sets walking lunges 10-12 per leg. 4) hand stand push up 3x3, pike push up 3x 8, ab wheel. 5) chins 3x6, overhand row 3x8, roman chair 3x3. 6) Leg day again. Jump rope warm ups most days. 

I am really looking to clean it up. I think I want a 3 day PPL I can set on repeat. I have heard a lot of science supporting frequency - I also need some energy left in the tank for life. I have considered  different full body days as well: A day: dip chin lunge, B day: handstand push up , pull up, roman chair and wedge squats. 

Any constructive feedback is welcome. I'm interested in hearing about training frequency and intensity as well. I have been giving thought 3 sets to failure - I think that is some of the beauty in bodyweight is how well recovery can happen if enough others stuff is going right.

1lk33u2,bodyweightfitness,How do you do beginner calisthenics and not have it feel like a boring workout?,"First, I'm 37. I look like I'm 27 but my body feels like I'm 67. I definitely don't look like a typical 37 year old. I'm normal build and no weight issues. I can do 2 perfect form chest to bar pull ups, 20 push ups and 5 dips. 

ƒ∞ have a love hate relationship with calisthenics and I want to explain so maybe I can get some tips about what I can do better.

Firstly, I thought I didn't care about skill work. I mean I would love to be able to do them but the effort/reward didn't feel worth it mainly because they take so long and doesn't give you the instant satisfaction of increasing the weight you're lifting. With that being said though I think the satisfaction in unlocking a skill is greater than the satisfaction is lifting 5 additional kilograms on a bar. In 2 weeks I went for 1 chin over bar pull up to 2 chest to bar pulls ups with perfect form and that satisfaction is greater than anything I got in the 6 years I lifted traditional weights.

The biggest issue I have is that bodyweight work seems to be really neurologically taxing for me so workouts take much longer and the next day I just feel heavy, if that makes sense. I also find workouts are mostly spent resting because they are so taxing. I need lots of rest between sets and exercises and I struggle to break out of that body building mindset of sets and reps which I don't want to really do. I tried for several years to get into calisthenics on and off and I alwasy just gave up. I got bored and didn't look forward to working out.

What I do love is the strength transfer to everyday life which is what I've always been lacking. I've never quite cared for lifting Xkg on a deadlift because unless I'm holding my kids in an overhead grip and lifting, then it doesn't help me cary them in an awkward position over long distances for example. Sure you get strong at that movement, but it lacks the core and stabilisation strength I find cali excels in.

Mobility is also an area calisthenics excels in. As I get older my health is more front and mind for me so I don't want to struggle getting off the couch when I'm 60. 
 
The older I get, the more I feel like cslisthenics just makes so much more sense from a longevity perspective but I'm in a rut and I don't know how to start enjoying it rather than treat it as a workout program in the body building sense. 

I've tried recommended routine, I've tried BWSF, I've even tried paid programs like calimove and other youtube ones and I'm not saying they don't work, that's not the point of this. I'm saying I find these workouts too taxing to enjoy them and it has nothing to do with the progressions. I'm able to do the reps,  I just don't find the structure enjoyable.

I just want it to become the lifestyle I hear so much about what haven't experienced so I'd love to hear some advice on how you made it work for you?

I'm thinking of getting myself a rogue dip belt, or a good one at least but I'm having difficulty making some decisions. Here's a little bit of background info:

So basically I don't live in the US and I am fully aware that buying rogue products from overseas are expensive asf (at least $200 USD total inc. taxes& shipping). Luckily I found an online platform which sells the rogue dip belt at a cheaper price in total. However, it's still gonna cost me about $100 USD which is still expensive for just a dip belt.

I've been looking for some good dip belts in terms of weight capacity and longevity but it's difficult to even find a dip belt here in the first place actually. All of the dip belts are either cheap in quality or don't handle that much weight.

Products on Amazon are either China imported stuff (I feel very skeptical abt their quality) with some random logo stuck on it or good but don't provide shipping to my place (like pullup&dip belt, very cheap relatively so it's a pity). Other good belts I've heard of like Gornation or King of weighted are gonna cost me too much in shipping&taxes I believe.

I would also like to ask, esp. for people with the rogue dip belt, should I just spend $100 and go for the rogue belt? Do you think it's worth getting it? Or are there any other good dip belt choices on Amazon you guys would recommend which will do me good for the lonnnnnnngg term?

1gdrnt9,bodyweightfitness,Questions about Simplicity-Focused Routine (Kboges) & Pull-Up/Squat Progression Advice,"**M20, 185 lbs, 5'10"", Busy College Student**

I started weightlifting about 1.5 years ago but switched to calisthenics in November 2023. I enjoy it much more, but I've been inconsistent with my training. I‚Äôve tried a few different programs, and most recently did the RR. I stuck with it over the summer, but once my college semester started, I couldn‚Äôt keep up.

Now, I‚Äôm looking for a simpler, more consistent approach. I want to focus on just the basics: push-up, pull-up, and squat variations to build overall strength, endurance, a fit physique, and longevity.

In my research, I‚Äôve come across Kboges' training method a few times. It seems to fit all my requirements, and his results prove that it works if you do it right. I have a few questions for those who have tried his style of training or something similar:

1. **Does it have to be EVERY day like he suggests?** Or can I do it 3-4 times a week? I might want to mix in some cardio on the off days.
2. **Pull-up progression help**: Right now, I can do 1-2 pull-ups (probably not the best form but I'm working on it), but using a resistance band has been messing with my form and doesn't feel like it‚Äôs helping. I‚Äôm thinking of switching to neutral grip and just going at it without assistance. Would that be a better approach? Any suggestions for progression?
3. **Single-leg squat variations**: I‚Äôve been doing hand-assisted shrimp squats and I'm ready to move on, but my knee collapses inwards when I don‚Äôt use support. Any advice for single-leg squat variations or mobility work to help with this issue?

1fui25s,bodyweightfitness,Training for Injury Prevention,"I am approaching 40 and I feel like I am constantly injured. I have experienced flare ups of hip pain and lower back pain for the last 15 years, and have tried all sorts of different training to keep it at bay. I've found over the past year or so I am now in pain every few weeks.

I am a recreational martial artist almost entirely focussed on taekwondo these days, so lots of dynamic kicks and also a lot of strength endurance work. I am wondering if the injuries are because I lack core strength and maybe glute strength, so when I try to increase press up numbers and work on lots of explosive kicking movements etc, I'm getting hurt. 

I also have a 5 month old baby, and carrying her around is definitely having an impact.

My goals at this stage of life are training longevity and meeting the demands of TKD training that include high rep press ups, chin ups, crunches, squats etc, explosive/dynamic kicks, mobility/flexibility, and general movement quality in getting up and down off the floor without hands, rolls etc. 

I have tried GTG type approaches which work fine until the volume reaches a certain point (usually around 150+ push ups/day) then my back pain kicks in.

The final factor is I am a family man with a full time job and lots of community commitments etc. So training is not my life, and martial arts training (patterns and heavy bag etc) will always be my preference when I do have training time, which is why GTG approaches hold so much appeal to me (also tried the K Boges 1-3 sets a day approach for similar reasons). But I keep getting hurt.

So I would really appreciate any insight into how to keep training, build up those basic calisthenic numbers, strengthen my core/glutes and do whatever else I need to do to prevent injury!",2024-10-02 14:51:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1fui25s/training_for_injury_prevention/
1epxas9,bodyweightfitness,What would be the effect if you trained like this & a comment on goal setting,"Was just wondering what the effect would be if for example for each movement (say horizontal push) you did 1 set of each: isometrics hold, full ROM BW, weights, and plyometrics. So for example for the aforementioned Horizontal push you did 1 set 30 sec planche lean, 1 x 8 archer rows, 1 x explosive PU, 1 x chest flies, then you move on to the equivalent for Vertical Push (say 1 x ring hold, 1 x dips etc)

  
Do not plan on programming like this (at least as of now) but just wonder if there would be any benefit for this (if any) and what the downsides are. I also think some of the chatter in the BW community is too specifically BW driven (I know, surprise) but as invariably will be the case goals will come up. Personally although I have focuse areas specific to BW in a cycle I generally as a 41 year old am happy with the skilsl and physique I have attained and think that skills I have not attained (planche) are probably out of grasp due to my age / priorities and height (6'4'') but the bigger point is my real goals are hard to quantify and largely not related to BW if Im being honest with myself (not to say that bw does not have a massive part to play). My goals are longevity based (at a long term level) and how I feel day to day (short term). Currently my overall fitness program includes bw as just one part - on wfh days 3 x a week I do kung fu in the morning and then 3x bw in the afternoon. On wfo days I cycle in and back (10km  round trip), and on weekends I either do inline skating or cycling with kids plus yoga for recovery / stretching

My goal is to find a comprehensive program that will not only give me a full body tune-up, but will help condition my body for longevity, build strength, consistently improve mobility/ROM, and progress enough to aid in muscle building/mass.

I saw noticeable differences, mainly in mobility and ROM.

1eomb9l,bodyweightfitness,How do you program barbell leg exercises into RR?,"Hi!

I've been doing RR for a couple of months now and it's going really good. I was thinking of incorporating squat & deadlift as suggested by the authors of the RR and I feel it's a good time to switch - I'm at 8 pistol squats on each leg and my nordic curl strap just broke. I also don't really do anything for my lower back.

My goal is to have relatively strong and healthy body, I'm going for longevity and don't really care about huge thighs, maxing out my potential or quick progress.

I have convenient access to a gym twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays (I also do RR on these days & once during a weekend). Would it be enough (given my goals) to do e.g. heavy deadlifts on Tuesdays and heavy squats on Thursdays? With proper warm up of course. If so, how do I program them?",2024-08-10 06:27:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1eomb9l/how_do_you_program_barbell_leg_exercises_into_rr/
1dul23z,bodyweightfitness,Do Barbells Save Time?,"**My actual question is for those of you who have trained regularly with bodyweight squats and deadlifts and also trained regularly with pistol squats and other single leg movements: Do the barbell movements actually save you time? If so, how much?**



I am not an athlete but just someone who would like to get a similar stimulus for my legs as, say, doing 8 pull ups. I'm conflicted about investing in a barbell and squat rack and looking to get a clear picture of what it is like to actually use barbell squats and deadlifts in the manner of the RR. 

According to [symmetricstrength.com](http://symmetricstrength.com), that sounds like a ballpark of 10 reps of 155 for back squat and 10 reps of 175 for deadlifts (though I would use RDLs). That said, I would not go to technical failure for safety reasons. 

For a long time, I have trained bodyweight only. I've simply accepted that I can't work leg strength/hypertrophy in isolation but will always be working balance and/or endurance at the same time (perhaps even primarily). This is not such a bad thing because, even if I do incorporate barbells, I will sometimes need to focus on stability for the sake of longevity of training. However, I often feel slightly frustrated that, compared to bilateral upper body movements, my leg training takes very long, requires high rep sets (a bit grueling), and doesn't give the same gains. 

It seems both methods have their time inefficiencies: Compound single leg movements double the amount of sets needed and only get so difficult. However, barbell movements seem to require several preparatory sets as well as changing out the plates. I'd hate to buy a barbell and squat rack just to find that it did not make my routine more efficient. 

(Peripheral note: I bought a sandbag because it seemed to be a cheaper option. For me, the bag works quite well for deadlifting since it has side handles. However, the squats are limited in weight by getting the bag up. I can use my upper body, but, again, that greatly limits the weight. I can use power cleans to get to a sort of zercher position, but that's an explosive movement with a relatively awkward object and it makes me nervous for my back when the weight goes up. I have a hard time picking up the bag for a bear hug squat since I am worried about rounding my back.)",2024-07-03 18:08:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1dul23z/do_barbells_save_time/

My *mostly* bodyweight ""legcentric"" exercises these days are:

* Jog ~18 miles/week, including some hills. ~9:30 min/mile pace. This is mostly for cardio fitness, but it also conditions the legs.

* 40 reps x 4 sets of bodyweight squats (160)
* 20 reps x 1 set of goblet squats
* 20 reps x 2 sets of Bulgarian split squats (40)

17t0p7a,bodyweightfitness,A Love Letter to Gymnastics Rings,"If I had only a handful of pieces of equipment to use for my training, rings would be a non-negotiable. Ever since getting my first pair, I've been converted into the cult of rings! I believe rings are an amazing tool just for the sake of staying consistent with workouts, which is the main key to success in any training regime. While I don't always use them in my training, every time I go back to them I'm reminded of how practical, effective and fun they are. 

The first thing that struck me about rings when I first got them was their shear versatility, primarily when it comes to upper body training. The exercise selection available on rings is astounding. Pull ups, and rows? No problem. Push ups and Dips? A lot more challenging than your typical pushing exercises but in a good way. It's really intuitive to adjust the intensity of certain fundamental movements like rows and push ups by adjusting your feet position to suit your level, making them excellent for beginners. Intermediate users will also enjoy experimenting with unilateral moves like single arm rows and archer push ups to keep themselves challenged. 

A great deal of this versatility is tied to their freedom of movement. If aesthetics are a goal of yours, rings can be used to hone in on specific parts of your physique. As such, they are an excellent tool for isolation exercises like curls, triceps extensions, chest flies and even ab movements. Additionally, they are  incredibly friendly on your joints. By not forcing your body to conform to the restraints of a rigid bar, you allow yourself to move in a way that's unique to your bodily structures. This reduces injury risk and will let you stick to your training and be less likely to encounter as many set backs. 

The number of places you can use your rings adds an additional element of novelty and fun to training. They can be anchored to a wide variety of structures, both natural and artificial. Combined with their portable character, there are numerous places you can turn into your own personal gym. Take them on a hike and find a sturdy tree branch. Ride your bike to a park and hang them on a some monkey bars, a basketball hoop, or a regular old pull up bar. Get some sunshine, fresh air and make some gains all at the same time. There's also nothing stopping you from taking them to the gym if you also like to incorporate weights into your routine. You can even find ways to mount them in your home. This eliminates any excuse to not get a workout in and increases your chances of adherence.

Rings are not without their downsides however. But by downsides, it's more akin to things you can't do with them, rather than damning drawbacks. When it comes to their free moving nature, this decrease in stability can diminish your force output compared to a fixed bar. This makes rings not ideal if your goal is achieving high rep counts (20+), using heavy external loads, or pushing specific muscle groups to failure without being hindered by systemic fatigue. The other thing is their lack of utility in lower body training. There are some valuable ring movements for legs, but they mostly come in the shape of providing assistance on moves like pistol squats and sissy squats. Considering you'd have those issues training bodyweight alone regardless of whether or not you have rings, its not a big drawback and you can always supplement your training with barbell, dumbbell or kettlebell training.

It's hard for me to think of a similar piece of equipment, fitness related or otherwise, that provides so much utility and benefit in such a simple form. Combined with their inexpensive nature, they are an outstanding investment into one's health and longevity. Please share your thoughts on ring training, what you love most about them and how they have impacted you!

2 sets each to failure of push-ups, pull-ups, squats, and planks done two separate days per week. 

The others 4 days you do 45-60 minutes of zone 2 cardio and then on one day you do sprint intervals. 

He claims that this routine is best for long term health and longevity as the zone 2 sessions allow for excellent recovery between strength workouts while also allowing plenty of time between strength sessions to fully recover and come back stronger. He believes that any more than 3 days of strength training a week becomes difficult to recover from for most people and just ends up resulting in fatigue and chronic stress/overtraining, joint pain, etc over time.

11noxcx,bodyweightfitness,"My response to the Kettlebell post, expanding on some concepts and why you should consider combining the two modalities."," 

I've created a new post for this as the BWF subreddit doesn't allow for crossposting! [u/Prowland12](https://new.reddit.com/user/Prowland12/) recently [wrote a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/11mglmr/a_guide_to_kettlebells_for_the_calisthenics) on the [r/bodyweightfitness](https://new.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/) subreddit outlining the basic principles of Kettlebell training for Calisthenics athletes. The post was really good in terms of outlining the fundamentals, however I do have some criticisms of it, and i feel it missed out a few points. It inspired me to write the inverse, and hopefully expand upon some of their points, whilst also giving further insight into how each modality can compliment each other.

A bit of my background, I consider myself an intermediate lifter with both modalities (I have attained intermediate-high levels of calisthenics skills, and mastery of a 32kg bell over 6y of calisthenics training and 2.5y of kettlebell training). Primarily I see myself as a calisthenics athlete (my training does bias calisthenics in general), however I have spent the last 2.5 years really honing in on combining them in a way that is effective and allows for progression in both.

First I would like to define *calisthenics* and *bodyweight training* (note, this is my personal definition). Calisthenics is a system of training that leads to advanced gymnastics type movements, such as front/back lever, human flag, planche, various ring skills, etc. The movements within these systems are often in two parts - the skill, and the strength. In broad terms, the skill component is a phase in which you teach your body to acquire the correct positioning of the scapula relative to the rest of your body, and the strength component is a phase in which you build strength in the relative muscle groups. The skill component is highly specialised, meaning that you are using exercises or movement patterns that are generally not found in any other training modalities (more on this later), and the strength portion uses a combination of standard compound movements and specialised exercises to build strength through ranges of motion specific to the skill.

Bodyweight training on the other hand, is a selection of basic compound movements such as the pull up, dip, push up, squat, and inverted row, which can potentially be loaded to progress.

Now that we have those two separate, I would also like to mention that my kettlebell training has solely been within hardstyle, which I feel is most conducive to being combined with calisthenics training. GS is a whole sport unto itself, and whilst I'm sure it could be programmed alongside some calisthenics or bodyweight training, the training volume and adaptations needed to excel at GS is greatly in opposition to calisthenics.

***Why should a kettlebell athlete consider Calisthenics/bodyweight training, or vice versa? What benefits does each modality offer?***

First, let's establish the most important factor - convenience. It's very common for people training kettlebells and/ or calisthenics/bodyweight training modalities to train at home. People need convenience if they are to be able to fit the equipment needed in their living spaces. Barbells and machines take up a lot of room, so having smaller and fewer pieces of equipment is really important.

Moving on...

**For the Kettlebell athlete:**

*Upper body vertical pull and push -* Truly, the only movement pattern that kettlebell training is missing is upper body vertical plain. Pull ups and dips can be a welcome addition to any kettlebell program, and are easily scaled or overloaded via bands/ concentric, or adding weight to a belt, respectively.

*The rings -* a unique piece of equipment, and one of the most convenient form factors that provides a huge amount of variety. The sheer number of upper body exercises that can be performed with the rings is legion, and the variety they can add to any program can be hugely beneficial. *QUICK TIP:* do not take pushing exercises on rings for granted, the instability when above the rings means you must work slowly and cautiously towards any vertical or horizontal pushing movement. Pulling movements however can be accessed immediately, and the free movement of the rings can actually be a huge benefit as they allow free scapula and wrist movement when compared to the closed kinetic chain of a bar.

*Straight arm strength -* here we start getting into the more unique benefits of the calisthenics. Straight arm strength can be defined as any pattern of movement in which the elbows remain in full extension throughout. Commonly, the high level calisthenics skills such as your levers and planches require the elbow to remain stationary, whilst the fulcrum of the shoulder joint moves through a range of motion. This type of movement puts extreme pressure on the connective tissue of the elbow (usually the biceps tendon) and scapulas, and without correct preparation and pre-habilitation, can result in serious injuries. A great way to get a sense of straight arm strength is to get into a push up position, fully protract the scapula and externally rotate your arms, and gently lean forward (this is called a planche lean). You will immediately start to feel pressure on the biceps tendon, as it works hard to stabilise the elbow joint. Some nice progressions include all the support positions on the rings, with the rings turned out as far as possible (just make sure to stabilise the scapula by depressing and protracting as hard as possible).

*Arms isolation work -* Whilst it is completely possible to perform isolation exercises for your arms with kettlebells, it's just way more convenient with calisthenics. The various curling and triceps extension exercises available with a bar and especially with rings are a worthy contender when compared to the equivalent kettlebell version.

*Scapula isolation work* \- calisthenics offers unparalleled ways to directly train the scapula. The scapula is the foundation for all upper body exercises and encompasses a huge range of muscles from the traps, serratus, rotater cuff, and many more. One of its role is to stabilise the shoulder blades relative to the rib cage and shoulder girdle, so a weak or poor connection to the scapula can result in any number of problems and injuries. Being albe to directly train the scapula in every plane of movement, with gravity acting in every direction (hanging, inverted, in a support hold, in a plank etc) will greatly improve strength and upper body health.

*Interoception -* something slightly more conceptual, but definitely worth mentioning is the ability to become closely connected to your body with calisthenics/bodyweight training. Learning to control a load through space via weight training has huge real world application, but having the ability to manipulate your own body through space cannot be understated. We are not perfect beings, we're clumsy and uncoordinated at times, and having a strong connection to the naturalistic movement patterns of your body can literally save your life in certain situations.

*Relative strength -* Something all calisthenics athletes understand is that having a lower body weight will make calisthenics easier. It just makes sense knowing that the load you are moving is governed by how much you weigh. Calisthenics athletes will strive to have as low body fat as possible to make up for this, however, the inverse is also true in lifting external weights. Often we are resisting against the weight, especially in things like kettlebell swings, so having more weight to resist against this will prove beneficial.

*Fun skills -* Honestly this isn't hugely important and highly individualised, but learning calisthenics skills is incredibly fun and fulfilling. Getting that first handstand hold, or your first lever skill is one of the most rewarding things you can achieve when pursuing calisthenics.

**And for the Calisthenics athlete:**

*The hinge -* The hip hinge movement pattern is notably missing in calisthenics/bodyweight training. There is just no good way to overload the hip hinge without weights. For a completely balanced system of training, no muscle groups can be left out, so it is vital that some kind of weighted hinging pattern must be included in a calisthenics/bodyweight program. It's non-negotiable, especially when you consider how vital the lower back and hamstrings are in their contribution to overall health and injury prevention (especially as we age!)

*Progressive overload for lower body exercises -* Continuing from the previous point about hinging, lower body training in general is not easily overloaded. Yes, it could be seen as a benefit to have smaller amounts of lower body mass when pursuing calisthenics skills, especially levers, but considering we use our legs in real world applications far more than our upper bodies, neglecting not only the most used, but also the largest muscle groups in the body will have detrimental effects to overall health as we get older. I live by the phrase ""to only train half of your body is to only experience half of what life has to offer""

*Rotational work -* Another missing component of calisthenics/bodyweight training is spinal rotation. It is hugely beneficial to the structural integrity and overall health of our spine. Things like bridge rotations and around the world leg raises can help, but have high points of entry, so it's worth considering the kettlebell alternatives. A programming that includes moving the spine in the rotational plain through a large range of motion, as well as resisting spinal rotation will fill in all the gaps here, so including windmills and single arm swings are well worth considering.

*Axial loading/spinal erectors -* Yet another missing component in calisthenics/bodyweight training modalities is the ability to load from the top down. This is another hugely important aspect of spine health and overall longevity or improved health span, so including goblet or racked versions of basic lower body compounds can be really beneficial here.

*Progressive overload for overhead pressing movements -* It's notoriously difficult to progress in overhead pressing movements with calisthenics/bodyweight training. First off, the point of entry for pike push ups is incredibly high, and secondly handstand push ups require a massive skill component. Pretty much every high level calisthenics coach online is in agreeance that working the strength and skill component of a handstand push up simultaneously is conducive to reliable progression. The fact that kettlebell weights are scalable down to the single kilogram will certainly help build towards the pike push up, and further progress strength when bridging the gap between a pike push up and handstand push up. I have also found, as the kettlebell sits on the outside of the arm, when performed with the right technique (external shoulder rotation, elbows kept to the front of the body as opposed to coming out sideways) the kettlebell press is quite reflective of the movement in a pike/handstand push up.

*Greater grip strength -* Something I have found in my own training, which may not be reflective of others, is that my grip strength increased hugely when using kettlebells. Something about stopping the bell flying away from you whilst using a more hook-like grip while performing heavy single arm swings is far more conducive to increasing forearm strength than simply hanging from a bar.

*Explosive (or 'ballistic') strength in the hips -* Upper body explosive strength is easily trainable in calisthenics/bodyweight systems - muscle ups, clapping push ups, and various other exercises offer a great way to train this. Explosive lower body training with calisthenics/bodyweight however offers a single exercise - jumping squats. The hips connect all the largest muscle groups in the body, and can generate the most strength through their movement, therefore training heavy swings and other such 'ballistic' hinging movements will teach you how to generate the most force or power, and has huge carry over to a plethora of real world and sports applications.

*Cardio, cardio, cardio -* another sadly neglected part of calisthenics/bodyweight training is cardio. Almost all kettlebell programs include an element of high intensity cardio, via the way of complexes, EMOMs, etc. Whilst this can be replicated through things like sprints, the additional quality of full body coordination whilst experiencing aerobic fatigue can have huge benefits for overall health, health span, and carry over to sports.

**For both:**

*A greater exercise selection -* without bogging yourself down in 'paralysis by over analysis', in which you fret mindlessly about the most effective exercise for the specific adaptation, or switch up exercises so frequently that you miss focussed work towards progression; having a greater exercise selection is great in circumstances where you are plateauing in specific movement patterns. Stopped progressing in your push up movements? Switch to floor press for your next mesocycle. Kettlebell rows not hitting like they used to? Try inverted rows. Having a larger selection of exercises can also be incredibly helpful in working around injuries, for example, when i had a shoulder tendinopathy and I couldn't press overhead at all, Turkish get ups came to the rescue, and allowed me to maintain my overhead pressing strength completely whilst the injury healed.

*Mobility training -* It can't be overstated how important having large active ranges of motion are over the course of our life and health span. The options offered by loaded mobility training can be woven into most programs, and having access to strength within larger rages of motion will also open up a whole new world of skills in calisthenics.

*Unilateral training* \- Something both modalities offer is unilateral training. As previously mentioned, we are not perfect beings, and having more coordination and strength when off balance can be life changing. Upper body calisthenics movements such as archer or single arm push/pull progressions, plus single kettebell loaded exercises such as single kettebell racked squats or single leg/single bell RDLs will teach you to better control your spine/core when off balance, reaping huge real world benefits.

***To conclude, It's fair to say that Calisthenics is an INCOMPLETE training modality. It's impossible to progressively overload certain movement patterns (i.e. lower body) to the same extent as others (i.e. upper body). Saying this, ALL calisthenics athletes should consider some form of weight training. I'm not saying kettlebells are the best answer here (it's wholly dependent on goals), but they could certainly be the most convenient or accessible. And a final point for Kettlebell athletes, it's worth considering the unique benefits that calisthenics offer in terms of upper body strength, connective tissue health, and your relative strength-to-bodyweight ratio.***

***How can you train both modalities simultaneously?***

A main way I am going to differ from [u/Prowland12](https://new.reddit.com/user/Prowland12/) post is I am not going to give you examples of how to structure your training. This is for two reasons - this type of training is highly specialised, and require a depth of knowledge that would require mountains of information being dumped into a single post, and I would like to keep this fairly concise (but please message me if you would like some specifics!). Second, each person has different goals and can allocate different amounts of time to each goal. The average teenager with no responsibilities is going to have much more time to dedicate to training than the average adult with kids and a full time job, plus everyones program will look completely different depending on their goals. It just feels counter productive to say, 'here is an exact programming method you can follow which will help you reach your goals' - progression is never linear in this fashion, and I feel we should all take it upon ourselves to be experimenters with our own body.

All that said, here are my main tips -

*Choose your goals wisely -* As combining the two modalities can cause conflicts in goals, it's best to choose fewer overall long term training aims. A good guide for a beginner would be to choose a single goal within each of the 4 main movement patters, i.e. 1 push, 1 pull, 1 squat, and 1 hinge goal. Conflicting goals are ones where the adaptations desired perhaps doesn't work towards the same end result - i.e. going for the planche will mean a whole lot of horizontal pushing work, so simultaneously trying to PB your overhead press might be conflicting, or trying to grow mass your legs whilst going for the front lever might extend the time it takes to achieve the front lever. Organising workouts to priorities the exercises that work towards your most desired goals will be really important here.

*Exercise order matters* \- understanding the effect of local muscle fatigue, and central nervous system fatigue during a single bout of exercise is key to programming for specific goals. Exercises placed later in the workout will be more difficult to progress due to the accumulated fatigue, so understanding how your body might react to certain periodisation methodologies is key to attaining long term goals

*Getting enough practice in -* When we talk about acquiring skills, frequency is the most important factor. Acquiring skills encompasses the ability to perform that skill safely, which should always be a priority when learning a new exercise. Getting enough frequency in a single movement pattern can be challenging when spreading your practice out over 2 modalities with multitudes of fundamental movements, after all, we only have a certain capacity for recovery, so it's stupid to think we can learn all the movement patterns and skills of even a single modality at the same time. Train smart - don't try take on too many skills at once. Especially when it comes to kettlebell training, learn to master one at a time and you will see much better long term development and SAFER practice.

*Step Loading* \- A form of progressive overload seen in both kettlebell and calisthenics/bodyweight training that relies on increases in volume prior to increases in intensity. It's great that this is seen across both modalities, as it allows for very similar structure to progressive overload between exercises in each modality, and can make structuring your programming much easier.

*Full body workouts -* Full body workouts can be an effective way to get frequent practice, however due to the fatigue generated over a single bout, are not great for long term development. Progress will stagnate over time due to not being able to get enough volume/stimulation in a single movement pattern/muscle group as your body adapts over time. It's also with considering the interference effect, in which certain adaptations can blunt others if performed in a single bout of exercise. Hence why, once you are out of the beginner stage and are proficient at the basic skills and movement patters, it may be a good idea to move on to...

*Concurrent training* \- This programming methodology relies on seeking specific adaptations on separate days through a micro/mesocycle. This could be set up as such over 4 days of training in a 7 day microcycle (note, this is my current programming!) - Day 1 - upper body strength focus, day 2 rest, day 3 full body cardio/endurance focus, day 4 rest, day 5 Upper body strength focus, day 6 lower body strength focus, day 7 rest.

*Change your technique to reflect your goals -* (I feel like this might be controversial to the purists out there). Much like i described with the overhead press earlier in the post, technique can be changed to better suite goals. First, It's important to distinguish the differences between FORM and TECHNIQUE. Form is a non-negotiable aspect of any exercise; it outlines the safest way to perform any given exercise, e.g. for a kettlebell swing, hinging not squatting, neutral spine, head and neck neutral, etc. Technique on the the other hand changes the movement pattern with the intension of emphasising a certain adaptation gained from the exercise without compromising form. For a kettlebell swing, this could be something as little as a wider stance, to something more unusual as adding a hard scapula retraction at the top of the movement to get more back 'gains'. I use this all over the place in conjugation with my training goals, and will be happy to share some specifics.

As per the title, I want to learn how to achieve body longevity. I am pretty fit and have been doing calisthenics & distance running for 3 years or so. I understand that everything will start to slow down as I age and approach my late 30s. I follow the NBA and my favourite player is Lebron because his longevity amazes me. Apart from eating healthy, drinking enough water, and getting enough sleep, what are some steps I can incorporate into my workout routines or external remedies to achieve long-term performance such as Lebron, except that I do not have 1.5 million to spend on my body each year haha. My joint conditioning is pretty good, I can hold a handstand for a minute without feeling pain, but long-term joint health & avoiding injuries is still my main concern. I have not had any major injuries but the usual overstraining of my shoulders and wrists, which has hindered my training from time to time. Any input is welcomed :)

yzxw30,bodyweightfitness,A balanced approach,"# G'day all,

I've been lurking in this community for quite some time and appreciate all the knowledge that is shared here. I've scrolled through the FAQs a number of times trying to find an answer to my question, so I'm hoping that I haven't inadvertently broken any rules posting here; apologies if I have.

I (30M) have been working out consistently for many years (I am in the military) and have recently completed Calimove's Level 3 calisthenics program, alongside Army PT. I would class myself as an early intermediate when it comes to BWF. 

Essentially, while lurking in the various fitness related communities on Reddit, I've found it difficult to find information on how to develop a balanced program, encompassing more aspects of performance than simply strength, simply endurance, simply cardio etc. I'm trying to combine it all, alongside the training I have to do in the Army, in order to hit multiple goals at once. I realise that means any such program wouldn't be *optimised* for a specific goal - but I am totally fine with more of a jack of all trades / overall balanced human performance type approach.

**Context / specific goals:**

I have a personal interest in getting some skills (muscle up, front lever, handstand); I want to be able to maintain my strength-endurance (smash out high rep pushups and pullups, which is relevant for the testing I have to do at work); maintain a decent cardiovascular ability (primarily for longevity purposes - I ain't getting any younger) and finally, be relatively comfortable when my heart rate is elevated to a zone 4 / 5 level, again relevant to PT testing. It's a lot, I know. 

As much as I have enjoyed it and have a tonne of respect for those guys, I'm unsure continuing with the Calimove programming right now is totally consistent with my goals (I'm not fussed by learning one arm pushups / one arm pullups etc).

As such, here is what I'm thinking - I'm curious about your thoughts. Any feedback is hugely welcome because it's my first stab trying to fit everything in together.

**Proposed Structure:**

1) Do the recommended routine 3x per week, however alternate between pure strength (lower rep range, harder progression) one day and strength-endurance (much higher rep range on the basics) another day. 

2) Box twice per week (I have a background in boxing) - hits the higher HR I'm after, again will transfer into the testing at work

3) Zone 2 cardio once per week

**Considerations:**

1) Yes, we do PT at work. However, the programming is aimed at the lowest common denominator. I'm by no means a fitness freak, but the programming doesn't do much for me. It looks like this: run once weekly (this would bring me up to two runs a week), play some low intensity sport once a week, do a combat fitness session once a week and do one strength-endurance session (which tends to be very easy). Then we get one day in the working week where we can do our own thing. Many of us will do additional training on top of this PT -myself very much included.

2) I've posted in BWF precisely because I'm interested in my strength work being primarily bodyweight (I have no problem with weighted dips / pullups though). I'm not keen on doing a 5/3/1 or a GZCLP style strength program - partially because I am nursing a lower back injury currently, for which I'm already seeing physio. BWF doesn't aggravate the injury, and the physio is fine with me doing it, which is why I initially started Calimove.

**Questions:**

I'm super curious as to what your thoughts are on the proposed structure. My initial concerns are: 

1) I've seen the RR referred to as a beginner program and I wonder if I'm regressing by moving from Calimove level 3 to RR?

2) A lot of volume - am I overcooking it? For reference, I always do PT at work and also train after work 5-6 times a week. So in terms of my conditioning, I feel comfortable that I can handle this workload. That said, on the surface it looks as if I've built in no time for actual recovery haha.

Again, apologies if I've totally missed where a question like this should go. It didn't seem to be an easy thing to answer; that or I could be super dense, which wouldn't surprise me!",2022-11-20 07:18:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/yzxw30/a_balanced_approach/
y2ztzz,bodyweightfitness,deload week questions,"Alright so I've reached the end of a 6 week basic rings program I've done for myself. I'd train 2x/week and gradually raise the reps and sets. It goes something like this:

‚óè1st week 
‚Ä¢pull ups 4√ó5 
‚Ä¢dips 4x6
‚Ä¢front lever open tuck/back lever tuck/L-Sit holds 2x15"" each
‚Ä¢Australian pull ups 4x12
‚Ä¢push ups 3x8

6th week:
‚Ä¢pull ups 5x8
‚Ä¢dips 4x10
‚Ä¢front lever open tuck/back lever tuck/L-Sit holds 2x15"" each
‚Ä¢Australian pull ups 4x12 (gradually decreased angle w/ floor)
‚Ä¢push ups 4x9 (same principle as A pull ups)

Now I'm looking to have a deload week this upcoming week because I figure I've put my body under a lot of stress and that's just a smart thing to do. I don't really know how much of an actual decrease in intensity I'm supposed to aim for though. 

Any recommendations and tips would be much appreciated, whether in terms of RPE or even clear reps and sets numbers even, or anything else. As a measure, my RPE was definitely around 8-9 on this last workout day of week 6.

Thank you so much!

TL;DR: I trained hard for 6 weeks on gym rings and want to deload for a week but Idk if I'm supposed to cut reps and sets in half or something else when it comes to concretely deloading.

Edit: Thank you all for your precious tips. Along with it I watched Jeff Nippard's video on that very subject (same same with weightlifting so i'll apply that). Someone said I shouldn't need a deload week if I only train twice a week. Maybe, maybe not. I train twice a week on the rings but also train bjj 2-3 times a week and always train early morning (around 6) next to my studies. So just for longevity's sake, I'd rather ""over-rest"" than injure myself. I will keep it in mind though and not drastically reduce reps, maybe only overall volume.",2022-10-13 14:14:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/y2ztzz/deload_week_questions/
svjaqu,bodyweightfitness,Straight arm strength and joint/connective tissue health,"Curious about anyones experiences with straight arm skills (front lever, L-sit, planche etc.) and tendon strength, particularly if you‚Äôve had joint/tendon issues in the past.

I‚Äôve dealt with elbow tendinitis for years that never got better until recently. I would either eternally rest it or hop back into my old workouts too quickly.
I‚Äôve finally been able to slowly rehab myself back and now I‚Äôm pretty much pain free and as strong as I was in college (26 now).

Naturally I‚Äôm determined to strengthen my connective tissue so I‚Äôm never plagued with an injury again. Is focusing on straight arm skills the best move?

rsgkt8,bodyweightfitness,This will be in my new website about holistic health:,"I would love some input:

""Intense Exercise including resistance exercise, weights, HIIT, calisthenics, and cardio could be the best holistic health practice ever,  by a wide margin.  Unfortunately too many people don't do the **intensity** part.  Most people can build a lot of health strength this way.  Intense exercise is actually more efficient  at triggering autophagy and apoptosis than fasting.

""There is definitely a ""too little"" and a ""too much"" when it comes  to intense exercise.  See the section about Hormesis.  Build gradually,  but don't be afraid of a little pain,  especially sore muscles.  Build your determination so that you  celebrate when you get to an authentic **failure**, when you simply  can't push or pull any longer.  Sometimes when I ""fail"" doing push-ups, my arms are so tired and so weak that I have to  roll over on my side and use my elbows to get up, while chuckling to  myself at what a victory that was.  Don't shy away from very long rest periods during the day.  The point of HIIT  (**H**igh **I**ntensity **I**nterval **T**raining, the best  way to exercise) is that you can put everything into your exercise.  Easy cardio is better than nothing,  but it does not qualify as intense exercise.  Intensity is the secret.  Intense exercise is insanely good for one's willpower, about on par with cold showers. 	   [ Dr. Peter Attia, MD on Joe Rogan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kYDVjX0G0)  Peter tells us in this podcast that intense exercise is the single best  'drug' for health and longevity. 	   	

""I actually spend very little time exercising.  I would guess  that perhaps 20 minutes per day, scattered all across the day.  But  those 20 minutes are down right heroic, like 100 push-ups in less than 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I  am resting.  Without adequate recovery, lots of people fail to progress.   I can't tell you how many young people I've seen on YouTube who complain that they aren't getting the  gains that they were hoping for, when they do 100 push-ups (or more)  every day.  They aren't giving themselves time to recover.  If your muscles still hurt, then rest.   This isn't rocket science.  It **IS** being excessively yang,  pushing one's self too hard and not allowing for recovery, which is an inherently yin or parasympathetic process.   No one should do intensity on the same muscle group day after day after  day.  Every other day is quite  sufficient.

pvtca1,bodyweightfitness,Creating a Program for Strength/Mobility Goals,"Hi guys, 

I finally started Body By Rings last week, and I really love the potential for strength gains and mobility gains, as well as the endless progression. While I‚Äôm super excited, I don‚Äôt want to just leave my work on weights behind as I‚Äôm still a beginner, and I also want to correct tightness in my hips, mobility in my ankles, and strengthen my joints in my legs and arms to avoid tendinitis and strengthen for longevity. 

Because of this, I‚Äôm toying with program splits that can balance these goals. But I‚Äôm obviously a beginner, so want some opinions and advice!

Here‚Äôs the basic overview of my plans:
(Specific Exercises aren‚Äôt chosen yet, these are just examples)

Day 1 = Upper Body w/weights. This will consist of Bench Press, Pull-ups, Pulldowns, OHPs, Flys, Rows, and strength work on my forearms, and wrists, as bicep/tricep work will be on rings later in the week. 

Day 2 = Lower Body w/weights. This will consist of exercises like Squats, Deadlifts, RDLs, Split Squats, Leg Presses, and traditional Ham/Calf work, with some leg raises. 

These above exercises are too much to do all together, so perhaps I could alternate each week, with a more chest focused Upper one week, and more Back focused the next. As well as Squat one week, and Deadlift the next.

After a rest day,

Day 3 = Rings Pull. This will consist of practicing Support Holds, then Pull-Ups, Rows, Pelican Curls and Facepulls one week, and then the next focus on Mantle Chin Ups, Archer Rows, and Bicep Curls the next week. 

Day 4 = Rings Push. This will consist of Support Holds, Dips, Archer Push-Ups, Chest Fly‚Äôs, and Tricep Extensions one week, and the next Dips, Pike Push-Ups, Bulgarian Push-Ups, and Tricep Dips the next week. 

Finally, 

Day 5 = Mobility day. This could incorporate some work off of Knees Over Toes Guy‚Äôs programs, specifically helping the joints of the legs, like ATG Squats calf raises, elephant walks, couch stretches, and some lower back stuff like back extensions. 

I‚Äôm sure this can amount to enough volume, and I‚Äôm hoping these workouts will amount to gains in strength on my presses and leg work, as well as improving mobility but also strengthening mobility once I get stronger in the ATG program. This also seems more interesting than just sticking with weights, and I can switch around the days depending on my schedule, as Ring days are shorter than weight days. 

Any advice from those who‚Äôve done this before would be great, and for any more info on my numbers or nutrition, just ask. Thanks x",2021-09-26 12:58:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/pvtca1/creating_a_program_for_strengthmobility_goals/
poau4s,bodyweightfitness,Are diamond pushups dangerous in the long run?,"When I (male, 22 years) first started doing diamond pushups (\~1 year ago), I used to get a lot of shoulder and wrist pain during my workout. Sometimes the pain continued even after the workout and that put me out of commission for a couple of weeks until my shoulders and wrists healed. Maybe my form was just bad, so I made sure I got my form down, and then after a few weeks of diamond pushups, got the same shoulder/wrist pain AGAIN. So I started doing the GMB wrist warmup and a shoulder warmup (a couple of sets before and after my workout). This helped me out A LOT, and for the past year, I NEVER HAD any wrist/shoulder issue ever again.

However, I noticed that when I'm near the end of my upper body workout, the final couple sets of diamond pushups cause *noticeable* (not anything unbearable but noticeable) pain on my shoulders DURING the workout. After my workout, I do my shoulder mobility stuff, and after a couple of minutes, the shoulder pain is completely gone. So, I didn't really think anything of this since it didn't impede my workout and I didn't have any post-workout pain. However, I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW03Vf4wH9I), and it claims (1:10) that diamond pushups have inherently bad form. And it got me thinking, am I setting myself up for major injuries in the long run? Will diamond pushups harm my shoulders if I keep up my current routine?

This exercise has helped me make significant gains on my triceps. But I am more interested in longevity and maintaining healthy joints, so if you guys have any suggestions please let me know!",2021-09-14 20:23:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/poau4s/are_diamond_pushups_dangerous_in_the_long_run/
onpw05,bodyweightfitness,Feedback on my Routine,"I have been working this routine for a while now, and have seen some decent results. I am concerned that I will not be able to maintain a progressive overload reasonably, and that maybe there is a way to slightly improve upon this routine. I hope to receive some constructive feedback on how to make this routine better, and also improve it for longevity. I really enjoy the repetitive nature of the routine and don't really feel like I'm neglecting anything major, but I hardly know what I am doing.

I am 36 year old male, 5'11"", 195lbs @ 12% BF. My goal is to lose another 3% BF (I know this has more to do with diet than exercise, so I am cleaning that up and nailing down my meal prep) and continue to grow muscle over time. 

Mon, Wed, & Fri:
10 rounds of
- 8 dead hang pullups
- 15 diamond push ups
- 15 shoulder shrugs with 2 x 35lb kettlebells
- 20 air squats
*Sometimes this is just 100 pull ups, 200 squats, 150 diamond push/Pike push ups, and 150 shrugs to spice things up.

Tue & Thur:
- 200 body builders style burpees
*I will mix up the variations occasionally to be 6 count, 8 count, Navy Seals, but pridomenantly do 6 count.

I typically run about 5 miles a week. Usually on the weekends.

I like to do 10min of jump rope or a 3/4 mile jog as a warm up each day.

Lastly, I try to do some accessory/supplemental work with bands (pull variations, bicep & tricep work, and shoulder stuff) and 100lb sandbag (hinge variations sandbag get ups. I will also do some ab work 2 times a week.

niii9j,bodyweightfitness,The 5 Pillars of Progress,"Most of us struggle to achieve our fitness goals for similar reasons. We hit a plateau with our training and find ourselves just going through the motions as our motivation drops off. Even worse, we get injured and struggle to just get back to where we were before.

Here are five points that are crucial to making steady progress and shaping realistic expectations around doing so.

## 1. Consistency

*‚ÄúYour success in training is the accumulation of effort over time. Any time you aren't adhering to a program is wasted time, so start, even if what you start with sucks. There is no optimal program.‚Äù* *‚Äî* u/m092

You‚Äôve heard it before and you‚Äôve heard it for good reason: consistency is key. Achieving any goal is simply a case of putting in the reps, over and over again. If you want to become a better runner, you must run; if you want to lift more, *you must lift more*.

Therefore, at any level of training, **consistency should always be the primary focus**. A good program and hard work are both important but they won‚Äôt do much for you if you quit.

The thing is, being consistent is hard. *Most people can‚Äôt do it.* Those who can reap all the rewards.

Whatever your goal, you must be consistent with the process (the set of habits that lead you to progress - more on this in Part 2).  If you‚Äôre just starting out, set the initial bar low. Don‚Äôt worry about the numbers, just focus on showing up and let time take care of the rest. You‚Äôre not special - it‚Äôs the same formula for everyone.

The mistake people make is wanting to be consistent with too much too quickly. This usually means that in the long run they burn out and return to old patterns of behaviour. Find a rate of progress that *you* can be consistent with as this will vary based on your prior experience.

If you‚Äôre not already in the habit of working out, you can‚Äôt expect to suddenly start hitting the gym five times a week.

If you‚Äôve never bulked up before, you can‚Äôt expect to start eating an additional 500 calories every day and not get sick of it pretty quickly.

## 2. Patience

If you‚Äôre a beginner getting into the gym, you‚Äôre probably going to be weak for the first 3-6 months. If you‚Äôre a beginner getting into running, you‚Äôre probably going to be slow as hell. Who cares? In a year or two, the difference will be night and day.

Would you rather be impatient and not achieve your goal at all or take a slower approach and *actually* follow through?

Alongside consistency, you must cultivate a greater degree of patience. Focus on gradual, sustainable improvement and you‚Äôll go pretty far. Focus on immediate results and you‚Äôll probably get carried away - think injuries, think burnout.

It‚Äôs easy to get carried away when you‚Äôre making progress. When it feels like you‚Äôre racing in the right direction, it‚Äôs wise to recognise that you‚Äôll probably at some point experience the other side of that coin. *Perhaps you don‚Äôt need to tick off all your fitness goals in the next three years but over a longer time frame instead.*

Impatience can obscure the bigger picture. Realise that as long as you‚Äôre showing up, you‚Äôre moving towards your goals and as long as you‚Äôre moving towards them, they are within reach. So make a commitment to yourself to stick with it; to take your time and to trust the process.

## 3. Recovery/Rest

When you‚Äôre committed to the long-haul, you don‚Äôt care about missing a day here and there. If you‚Äôve been consistent in showing up and patient with your expectations, taking a day to rest when something feels off (or you just don‚Äôt feel like training) isn‚Äôt an issue - in fact, it‚Äôs probably a good thing.

Don‚Äôt let perfectionism cloud your judgement. As Tim Ferriss explains in *The 4-Hour Work Week*, *‚ÄúFocus on great for a few things and good enough for the rest. Perfection is a good ideal and direction to have, but recognize it for what it is: an impossible destination.‚Äù*

Further, don‚Äôt buy into the idea that working hard means resting less - it‚Äôs the opposite. Pushing in one direction requires an equal push in the other. You can choose to consciously sustain this balance by taking the time to recover when needed, or you learn the hard way by getting injured. This is particularly important when you‚Äôre first starting out as your body isn‚Äôt acclimatised to the stress you‚Äôre suddenly putting it through.

More often than not, insufficient rest will lead to lower quality workouts which will then lead to less motivation on your part, less consistent effort, and ultimately, less results overall. Think long-term baby.

## 4. Quality Over Quantity

By lifting with your ego you‚Äôre doing your future self a disservice. Using bad form may get you a few more reps today, but usually at the cost of better results in the future. Those extra reps might make you feel like you‚Äôre killing it in the moment - but they could also lead to a week off as you take time to recover.

To reach our long term goals, we must place quality over quantity. Take pride in your ability to perform movements well. A clean set of pullups is more impressive than whatever they‚Äôre doing over in the CrossFit section. Again, you‚Äôre not above the process - using bad form will catch up with you, it‚Äôs a question of when it will happen, not if it will happen.

Realise that when you go on YouTube and see those guys making L-sit pull-ups [look effortless](https://youtu.be/j3MTqRWPiZU?t=124), it‚Äôs because they first learnt to do 1 with strict form. From there, 1 became 2, 2 became 3 and so on. They didn‚Äôt bad form their way to perfect technique.

## 5. Progressive Overload

Incremental progress. That‚Äôs the key to improving. Progressive overload is about gradually increasing the strain on your body so that it‚Äôs forced to adapt and come back stronger, faster etc.

For example, when it comes to lifting, we can do this in four main ways:

1. By increasing the weight on our lifts.
2. By increasing the number of reps or sets in our training.
3. By increasing the frequency that we train.
4. By performing exercises at a slower rate (i.e. greater time under tension).

*From comments* u/m092\*:\*

\- *Or at a faster rate for an entirely different adaptation focus.*

\- *Also increasing work density, e.g decreased rest times, or total sets/reps in a given time, or same reps/sets in less overall time, etc.*

&#x200B;

But if your goals lie outside of lifting (and some probably should for the sake of balance and longevity) the same concept applies - the general idea is to increase the workload (or stress) on your body.

To do this, find ways to challenge yourself ever so slightly. In turn, this will become a habit - you‚Äôll always be looking for small ways to improve and it‚Äôll show in the results you achieve.

I (34M) am a late bloomer with regard to exercise, having taken 30 years to find a form of exercise (cycling) I enjoyed. I didn't think of it as exercise since I was living in a beautiful hilly coastal city at the time, in a country that was also full of interesting remote places and incredible landscapes to explore. 

My bike was a means to fitness, transportation, and adventure all in one, although it was more like the adventure came first and the fitness was a great side benefit. I didn't get fitter to go further; going further made me fitter.

Well, my life took a very unexpected turn and I don't have access to cycling anymore. Thanks to a brain tumor (I've recovered), the pandemic, and travel restrictions, I'm now basically home 99% of the time with my parents in a suburb that is the exact opposite of my ideal lifestyle. I ""need"" to do strength training because of below-average bone density (had a DEXA scan in 2017) and want to fix my perpetually skinny-fat no-muscle physique, but strength training just seems... like a chore.

Mostly this is because the results I'm after (physique-related) are slow to manifest and the longevity benefits (osteoporosis prevention, not becoming an invalid) won't matter until I reach the median age of where I currently live (almost 60). Like, I didn't keep cycling because I could feel my likelihood of a heart attack go down; it gave me a runner's high and took me places. Then after a while my old clothes didn't fit anymore and that was pretty cool. 

So if you are in a similar boat as me, what have you successfully used as immediate-term motivation/benefits for your workouts?

I have a couple concerns that I wanted to ask about, when it comes to weight lifting and calisthenics.  

Does calisthenics offer itself to a long and healthy life more than weight lifting?  It's rare I see older weight trainers but I often see older people at my local park doing basic calisthenics.

Why is it that so many weight lifters are so beat up?  Is it the focus on weight at the expense of form or is it the fact the human body really shouldn't be lifting massive amounts of weight.  Something I've noticed about progressive calisthenics is that there are stop signs built in for mobility and flexibility that aren't really there in weight training.

Personally I'm into kettlebells but even when I perform them, I can tell maybe I won't be doing this in 50 years.....

hpw4h1,bodyweightfitness,4 years on Recommended Routine - in awe by it,"I've been doing the RR for some 4 years now (I've been a very long-time lurker and just recently finally made a reddit account). 

I haven't been doing the RR straight - maybe 6-8 months each year. I'd try another program, like Body by Rings or Antranik's hypertrophy program, or take time off due to an injury - but I'd always go back to the RR. 

After the first couple of months of doing the RR, I stopped doing the skin the cat & handstand progressions and the bodyline (core) exercises as my focus has been strength and hypertrophy. 

In late 2019, I discovered the updated RR, which doesn't have L-sits, so I stopped doing them altogether. I'd like to add that am male, months away from turning 40, and having had my share of injuries in my younger years, I focus strongly on longevity and go thru progressions slowly... after some 4 years, I was still on advanced tuck L-sit for 29"" for each set.

7 weeks ago, I decided to learn some skills so I got Calisthenic Movement's Complete Calisthenics (CC) program since it ""includes direct skill training."" The program has 5 levels and each level has a minimum requirement for how many reps/hold time are needed of 6 exercises. The pullups, dips, and pushups requirements for all the levels are no problem, but Level 3 and up have wall handstand, skin the cat, and L-sit requirements. I haven't trained them in years or achieved the full L-sit, so I started with level 2. It's pretty easy compared to the RR with only 4 exercises per day and a warm-up 3x a week, but I figure I can build up my wall handstand time.

Yesterday, I tested my wall handstand and held it for 42"". I realized I actually passed the handstand requirement for CC Level 4. I figured, why not see if I can meet the other requirements? Tried skin the cat, which I haven't trained in 3 years, and was able to do 5 reps with no momentum. I then tried the full L-sit, which I'd never tried and stopped with advanced tuck months ago, and held it for 17""!

I am in awe and beyond impressed by the RR. It had become quite routine (pun intended) and normal for me. I didn't think I'd get the wall handstand that quickly (7 weeks with 1x or 2x holding it per week) or be able to do the other two exercises - I didn't know my own strength at all... If I had never dropped those 3 exercises, I know I would've blown past the level 5 requirements. I hope the money spent on CC is worth the ""direct skill training.""

Anyway, the RR is really a great program. Good for years and years and, like it says, it really does give ""you a solid basis for most other things you might want to get into.""",2020-07-12 15:25:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hpw4h1/4_years_on_recommended_routine_in_awe_by_it/

Due to quarantine a lot of people have been building their own calisthenics gym, and I've [joined the trend.](https://imgur.com/a/r91oSJy) If you want a basic rundown on how to build this design, check out [this guide](https://youtu.be/29ESce1kqRc) and show some love to the creator (not me). Mine is modified in ways I describe below. That being said, this isn't a build guide, but a recommendation for certain design specifications that'll help you get the most out of your gym, what I learned in building it, and what I did right/imperfectly to help you construct yours the best you can.

I work as a construction/painting/deep cleaning handyman, so I brought my professional experience to this project and hope it provides you insight.

**Recommendations**

* Stall bars being perpendicular to dip bars. This simple design choice opens up amazing possibilities. Using the stall bars to support your feet, you can perform pike pushups on the dip bars with your feet at various levels. You can also support your feet on the stall bars and do regular pushups on the dip bars. This affords advantages over regular pushups: 1) your wrist position is healthier in neutral grip 2) you can go deeper than other pushup variations to activate pectoral muscles (be sure not to go too far and overextend your deltoids) 3) there is enough clearance between you in the ground to do weighted pushups with a dip belt.
* Five foot pull up bars. Long pull up bars give you enough room for wide pull-ups, or archer pull ups, which take the most space. By having wide bars it offsets the safety risk of having concrete feet around your posts (a negative I'll go into later).
* Dip bars 20"" apart. This may very well change depending on your shoulder width, but a good average distance between dip bars is 20"" for shoulder health. Common recommendations are between 18"" and 22"". Measure your shoulders and customize it to your needs! Don't just do what someone else tells you. This will effect the distance of your stall bar posts in this design, so make that calculation first!
* Low pulp bar. Not low enough for Australian pull-ups, which you should do on the dip bars, but low enough that you can jump on top of the bar and do a negative muscle up. This also allows you to do an assisted pistol squat to assisted muscle up, a huge benefit when transitioning into more difficult movements.
* Stall bars protruding from the post on one side, with rubber caps. Having your stall bars slightly longer than they need to be gives you grips at various heights. This allows for inclined one armed pushups, and handy places to grab and perform stretches, dragon flags, etc. Doing this makes sizing the dip bars easier as well, because the length of your stall bars doesn't need to be perfect in order to space your dip bars according to your personal preferences/shoulder width.
* Dip bars supported on one side by 90 degree angle joints, not posts. This allows for freedom of movement and paralette work. You don't want to come down from a planche too fast and strike your body on the edge of a fence post. You don't want to have to clear the corners of a post when doing a retracting your legs from a wide leg movement. Having the outside edges be galvanized steel pipe joints is safer, and it is cheaper than posts, mainly due to the fact that you don't have to use as much concrete to set them (more on that later).
* Dip bars require less concrete to stabilize. The width of your post hole, and therefor the amount of concrete you need to set the post, is based on the width of the pole you are trying to set. By having one side of your dip bars supported by steel pipe, not only do you get the benefits previously listed, but your post holes don't have to be as deep or wide. Save yourself the work, money and safety concerns by making one side of your dip bars supported by steel rather than wood.
* Bars supported by pipe flanges/wood screws on one side, supported simply by sitting in a bored out hole in the post on the other. Your bars don't need to be fastened down on both sides. They only need to be attached to one post and sit *inside* the opposite post. This saves you money on flanges, which ran me $13 a piece, saves you on the effort of installation, and allows you to easily level the bars by seating them in the hole, then only having to manipulate one side. Also, definitely go with coated wood screws over bolts! Bolts are expensive, require washers and nuts, and unnecessarily protrude from one end of the post, creating a hazard. Four 3"" in wood screws is more than strong enough, and remember: the other side is sitting inside the post itself, which is stronger than any fastener and keeps the bar from moving at all (except for the bar flexing under weight, which is minimal for a galvanized steel pipe).
* Hook screws to hang rings/dip belt. This is minor preference, but a very good idea if you live in a windy area. By putting round, rubberized hooks up (safely away from where you'll be working) you can hang your rings on them, that way the wind won't thrash them around, making unnecessary noise and causing dings in your posts or splinters in wood rings.
* Stain your posts. For $10 you can protect your structure and make it look beautiful with wood stain. Don't stick pieces of construction equipment in the ground and call it good. Stain or paint your posts before installing them! To avoid running textures while staining, have a few painter's cloths handy and wipe excess stains *from end to end of the post.* It's imperative when doing this that you start on one end of the post and draw the cloth all the way to the other side for a nice blended texture. This extra hour or less of work will make your gym look great! Also, be sure to paint your bars with an oil based paint. This will also only cost you about $15, and if you're following the recommendation of only attaching the posts with flanges on one side you are saving a ton of money. An oil based paint will survive the weather, stick to metal, and reduce heat absorption from the sun. Mine are black and I live in the tropics; it's still better than bare steel. If you have neighbors or cool landlords they will really appreciate it, you can make your gym your own. Calisthenics isn't just utilitarian; there's an element of personal style and aesthetics to it, so bring that to your gym.
* Use supports while the concrete sets. Don't just level your post and leave it! As the concrete dries the post will shift unless you support it. Use other pieces of wood and clamps if you have them to make 45 degree angle supports while your concrete sets for at least 24 hours, but waiting 2-3 days is recommended.
* You don't have to mix the concrete before putting it in the post hole. Having to mix the concrete first is a common misconception. You can fill the hole with around 6 inches of concrete, spray it with the hose, repeat. It's far less messy, and mixing concrete is work you just don't have to do. In rainy areas people putting up a fence can literally just fill the holes with concrete, support the posts and let the rain do the job. Don't premix your concrete.
* Drill extra wood screws into the base of your posts so they can grip the concrete. Take four of those coated wood screws you're using to attach your bars, drill them into the posts about halfway between the base and the surface, facing upward at a 45 degree angle. This allows the posts to grip the concrete similar to a rebar structure. It's incredibly cheap in the grand scheme of the project and will make your posts that much more stable.
* Bury your posts *at least* 1/4 of the way into the ground. The sturdiest post is at least 1/3 of it's length into the ground, but that's for building a fence that needs to withstand wind force. You're just a person, and your force is mainly driving the posts down, not to the side, so you can get away with burying a 10"" pole 2.5"" ft into the ground. This will save you on buying longer polls and allow you to have your bars off the ground so that you can dead hang and not touch the ground.
* Put a few inches of concrete below the post before setting it. This seals in the bottom of the post and prevents wood rot. It'll increase the longevity of the structure, and concrete is cheap. You will have to dig a few inches deeper, which is the most laborious part of the job, but it's worth it.
* Build away from septic tanks/buried cables! I didn't learn this through trial and error, but I can force someone making this mistake. Make sure it's ok to dig down 2-3 feet in the area you want to build your gym.
* Have your department store cut your posts and thread your pipes. First several cuts are generally free, after that it's $0.25 each. No more than $3 to avoid all that work.

**Things I would do differently**

Fortunately this is a short list, but there are a few things I'd have done slightly differently, so don't make these mistakes!

* Paint any bars that will be sliding through a hole after you install them. I only did this with a few stall bars, but don't paint your bar first and then scratch it off the paint by sliding it through the bored hole it will be sitting in. Definitely paint all your flanges, dip bars and pull up bars first, but in this design you should put the stall bars up before painting them. Or, you could paint them first, accept that they'll get scratched, and just touch it up when you go to do the second coat of pain (which you should be doing anyway).
* Concrete feet? They're pretty, but they are a safety hazard. Having differing ground elevations and sharp edges is not ideal, especially if you have children who want to play on the gym. Given that my pull up bars are so wide and there are no small children in my house, it's perfectly safe, but it still takes a few extra bags of concrete. The posts are sturdier, but I think that's negligible, while buying a footing tube costs about $10 and takes extra work. I'd recommend going without the feet.
* Buy more concrete than you think you need. I've set concrete before, but you can always return what you don't use, and I ended up using more. This was due to the concrete feet and the decision to put a few inches below the posts as well, which I didn't factor into my initial design. Concrete is pretty cheap, so just stock up and return what you don't use rather than making multiple trips.

**Conclusion**

Building your own calisthenics gym is fun and incredibly rewarding. Once you have it up you'll never have to pay for a gym membership, spend time and gas money going to where you want to exercise, can train any time without interruption or sharing equipment, and will have far more options afforded to you. I save about 3 hours a week, or 12 hours a month (that's 1.5 work days!), by working out at home rather than getting ready, stopping for gas, and traveling to my nearest gym. I save about 15$ a week, or $60 a month, by not burning gas in traffic. I save $25-$50 a month on not having a gym membership (depending on what gym I chose to go to). This project will pay for itself in four months. I can't recommend this highly enough; if you can build your own gym, do it.

If you have any questions I'm more than happy to answer them!

ghsf34,bodyweightfitness,"High volume squats are lubricant for our joints, I've realized","For background, I've been doing weightless squats since January in decent number. My flexibility felt great and I never had knee pain. I never had a history of it, either, though.

Anyhow, I stopped doing it for a month because I was focusing on burpees (I figured they counted because there's somewhat of a squat involved). Anyhow, during this month I had been noticing mild discomfort when holding a deep squat (which I had previously held very comfortably). Anyway, after 3 weeks of many burpees and a week off, I went to get back to the high reps and I found my legs were not having it. I realized that my abstinence from high rep squatting had stiffened my joints.

Basically, I intend to do at least 20 air squats a day for the rest of my life, if only for joint longevity.",2020-05-11 17:45:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ghsf34/high_volume_squats_are_lubricant_for_our_joints/
gej6dy,bodyweightfitness,Bodyweight resistance training regimen and muscle retention/longevity,"Hello everyone. Here's a topic that I seldom ponder over and would like to know what you guys know and have rather experienced. It's a thought simply out of curiosity.
Is it a possibility that muscles built out of calisthenics/bodyweight regimen have an edge over the ones built using equipment, even to a small degree in terms of longevity? Could it be thought and drawn parallel to be having done with rigorous volume in calisthenics that have a greater long term stimulus and endurance response? Considering a same level of naturally built physique, when built using calisthenics and other using equipment, calisthenics one surely calls of more volume overall.",2020-05-06 12:35:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/gej6dy/bodyweight_resistance_training_regimen_and_muscle/
g8flxd,bodyweightfitness,The Perfect Calisthenics Home Gym: My Top 10 Pieces of Equipment for Efficient Bodyweight Workouts and for Building a Well Proportioned Physique,"During the last 5 years I‚Äôve been training more than 90% of the time from home and I thought that now it could be a good moment to reveal my calisthenics home gym. You can watch all my equipment on this video:

[https://youtu.be/61l2jTUvOPo](https://youtu.be/61l2jTUvOPo)

I‚Äôll put below my top 10 pieces of equipment. I‚Äôve divided them in 3 categories:

1. The 2 Things Everyone Needs (Items 1-2)
2. Best Equipment To Maximize Strength & Muscle Gains (Items 3-6)
3. Bonus Equipment To Minimize Injuries & Master Calisthenics (Items 7-10)

This list will be great for you if you still haven‚Äôt don‚Äôt have a home gym. It will give you clarity on what‚Äôs more important and what you‚Äôll need for your specific training goals.

And if you already have some equipment I still think this can be useful and give you a couple of ideas to take your home gym to the next level.

Before getting started let‚Äôs bust the myth that you only need the floor to work your full body. Sure on the floor you can get pretty far with horizontal and vertical pushing (aka pushup and handstand variations).

However, the floor won‚Äôt be your friend when it comes to pulling exercises and giving your back and biceps a proper workout. 

Lately I‚Äôve seen some cool hacks to workout your back without buying any equipment (using doors, tables, broomsticks,...). This can be a good solution for a few days but over the long run you want to have the equipment from the list to make your training more enjoyable, secure and scalable.

# 1. Pull Up Bar

The pull up bar is key for working on the vertical pulling pattern and even the horizontal one once you get more advanced.

That‚Äôs what will help you strengthen and build your back and biceps.

There are lots of options in the market. The video is your friend but I‚Äôll do my best to describe them here:

* **Door Pull Up Bar (Top Anchor)**: to be honest I was surprised by how stable it was when I used it for the first time. But you still need to be careful and avoid swinging. Compared to the other options this one offers you the neutral grip which for some is easier and nicer on the joints than supinated. The con is that it can damage the top of your door.
* **Door Pull Up Bar (Lateral Anchor)**: this one can be less secure but the good thing is that you can adjust the height. This means that you can also do horizontal pulling (aka rows) and get a full back workout. It can also damage the contact surfaces.
* **Wall Pull Up Bar**: if you don‚Äôt mind drilling the wall and having the bar there 24/7 it‚Äôs a great pick lol (it‚Äôs normally used for garage gyms)
* **Mountable Pull Up Bar**: it‚Äôs similar to the one from the park but it‚Äôs not locked on the floor so it has a wider base to be stable. That‚Äôs the option it gives you the ability to perform more exercises safely (muscle ups, levers, ‚Ä¶)
* **Power Tower**: it‚Äôs a combination of a pull up bar and a dip bar. Great bang for your bang for your buck.

Generally the door pull up bars start at $20 and the bigger structures can go over $200. If you‚Äôre serious about building a strong and proportionate upper body that‚Äôs a crucial pick.

# 2. Dip Bars

While the pull up bar is great for working on the vertical pulling pattern, the dip bars (aka parallel bars) are great to start working the horizontal pulling pattern which is key for doing a complete back workout.

Moreover with dips bars you get the chance to standard dips. Even if you can get the vertical push from pike pushups (upward vertical push), dips are still useful as they are a downward vertical push).

Here you generally find 2 options:

* **Separate Dip Bars**: I‚Äôve these ones for two reasons. First, you get to adjust the width to whatever feels right to you. Second, once you finish the workout you can put them together and they take up less space. The con is that they can be less stable but it has never been a big problem for me.
* **Glued Dip Bars**: these are more stable but you will always have them in the same position unless you can disassemble them.

You can get cheaper options from around $50 but if you go the branded route it can get over $100.

# 3. Rings

That‚Äôs the first item from the category Best Equipment To Maximize Strength & Muscle Gains.

Rings actually offer you every key exercise described before but the thing is that you may struggle finding a spot to hang them. Once you‚Äôve a pull up bar this isn‚Äôt a problem anymore.

Even if you already have the pull up bar and dip bar, Rings can still be great for these reasons:

* **Ability to move freely**: you can experience it when doing things like chin ups as you don‚Äôt need to be all the time with a supinated or underhand grip. Instead you normally start with neutral at the bottom and you supine as you get to the top. This small tweak can pay you dividends when it comes to elbow health as close grip chin ups can put extra pressure on your elbows at the bottom position.
* **New exercises**: once you get the rings you unlock some new exercises like chest flies, tricep extensions and face pulls.
* **Adjustable resistance**: for some exercises like rows or tricep extensions you can adjust the difficulty by changing the distance from the floor. Normally the closer the rings are from the floor the harder it‚Äôs gonna be.

You can get rings from around $20 but it can get more expensive depending on the material and brand. I use the plastic ones as I train outdoors but if you‚Äôre indoors and your hands sweat easily, the wooden option will be better for you.

Finally, whenever it comes to dips I actually prefer doing them on dip bars. Sure, doing dips on the rings can be more challenging as you need extra coordination. But at the end of the day, muscle building depends largely on mechanical tension and you can get more of that combining dip bars with external resistance which I‚Äôm gonna discuss on the next item...

# 4. Weight Vest

If you‚Äôve already been training for a while a weight vest can be a great investment.

A weight vest will allow you to keep progressing with the main bodyweight movements without having to rely on one arm variations which I don‚Äôt particularly like because they take double the time to complete and they can create extra stress on your joints. I know too many people who developed golfer's elbow when training the one arm chin up...

Also the weight vest is the most **versatile** type of external resistance. You will hardly find an exercise that you cannot perform with a weight vest. I even can do handstand pushups with a vest or use it for my leg training.

Sure you may not be able to load it as much as a dip belt but that‚Äôs why the weight vest is a better place to start. 

Here the price will mainly depend on the weight. You can get the 10kg (22lb) vests for less than $50. If you can afford it, I would strongly recommend you to pick something over 25kg (55lb). This will most likely be over $100 though.

A good tip to make your weight vest last longer is to use slower tempos. For example using a 3 second negative and a 1 second positive. If you combine that with full range of motion you won‚Äôt really need that much external resistance.

# 5. Push Up Bars

If you‚Äôre someone prone to wrist pain I really recommend it to you.

In fact, thanks to push up bars I was able to get good with handstands really fast and master the different handstand press variations.

When using push up bars you get to put your wrists on a much easier position and you‚Äôll most likely forget about your wrist pain. But still I recommend you do some sort of wrist warm up before your workouts.

Push up bars will also give you an extra range of motion and the good thing is that they are more portable than parallettes as they are smaller.

This is probably the cheapest piece of equipment as you can get ones for like $5.

# 6. Dumbbells

I know this may sound a bit contradictory with the idea of bodyweight training but if you care about results I think they‚Äôre really worth it. 

After I started to use dumbbells I added in 2 months almost 2 inches to my arms, which sincerely is something that the ladies won‚Äôt regret. And for me this was a big deal as I‚Äôm someone with naturally long and lanky arms.

But most importantly dumbbells can help you address different weak links that can be hard to target with only bodyweight exercises.

Last but not the least, if you combine dumbbells with the weight vest you can get a pretty decent leg workout without much need for a squat rack.

The price for dumbbells normally starts at $40 for a 20kg (44lb) set. This means you get two adjustable dumbbells with a maximum weight of 10kg (22lb) for each one.

# 7. Yoga Mat

The yoga mat is the first item from the category of Best Equipment To Minimize Injuries & Master Calisthenics.

This is what I use before every workout to do my wrist warm up, if you‚Äôre serious about handstands you definitely should be doing this and even if you don‚Äôt I still think it‚Äôs a good thing to do to bulletproof your wrists.

Talking about handstands I‚Äôve also used the yoga mat countless times for the different bodyline drills.

What will surprise you is that I don‚Äôt use the yoga mat at all for ab exercises. If you do the main bodyweight exercises with proper form you‚Äôll already be working your core. Aside from that if I want to target my core I normally do exercises on the bar like hanging leg raises.

On the other hand, I used this a lot when I was learning the press to handstand as I had to do lots of stretching. But still today I try to do some daily stretches for the main muscles that usually get tight when sitting or doing any other daily activity.

Yoga matts are normally priced from $10. The cheaper options are normally thinner which means they can break faster. 

# 8. Elastic Bands

I use elastic bands all the time before my workouts to warm up my shoulders. If you want to have longevity in calisthenics it‚Äôs key to treat your shoulders well.

But also I use them to increase or decrease the difficulty of different exercises or skills. I especially used to make pushups and squats harder. Even if you don‚Äôt get that much added resistance this still can be great as you change the strength curve of the exercise and this by itself can be enough to keep progressing.

I especially use them to decrease the difficulty on exercises like front levers and front lever rows. By the way, if you want to use bands for front levers it‚Äôs extremely easier to set it up with rings but not that easy on the bar.

On the other hand, if you‚Äôre starting out bands can be great for pull ups or dips.

Finally, I also use elastic bands for high rep arm work to keep my elbows healthy. You can do bicep curls by anchoring one extreme of the band on your feet and you can do tricep extensions by locking the band on a pull up bar.

The price here depends on the resistance of the band. The lighter bands can cost less than $5 and the heavier can be over $20. Generally speaking, you can get a wide range of bands for less than $50.

# 9. Parallettes

Parallettes have a lot in common with pushup bars but still they offer some new things that are worth mentioning.

The first one is that they normally have a thicker grip than push up bars which creates a nicer grip and makes hand balancing a bit easier.

Another difference is that they‚Äôre not as close to the floor. This can actually have a huge impact when practicing different calisthenics skills. For example, it can make the transition from a handstand to an L-Sit achievable without having to develop insane levels of mobility. Also they‚Äôre great for leveling up your pike or handstand push ups as you‚Äôll have much more range of motion.

The takeaway here is that I would recommend you to get Parallettes if you‚Äôre someone interested with skills like handstands, handstand presses, L-Sits and planches. They‚Äôre normally priced over $20 but the branded options can easily go over $50.

Generally speaking, the bigger and heavier are gonna be more stable but they're gonna be more expensive. Wood here can also be an interesting option if your hands sweat easily.

# 10. Dip Belt

If you use a weight vest and you do your negatives with 3 seconds and full range of motion you won‚Äôt really need this until very long.

But at some point the weight vest won‚Äôt be enough because the heavier weight vest can normally carry up to 30kgs or 66 pounds. 

At that point it will be a good idea to get a dip belt which you can load whatever you want as long as you have the necessary plates.

It‚Äôs good to mention here that the dip belts work great for pullups and dips on higher bars. Normally the standard dip bars won‚Äôt let you get through all the range of motion with a 20kg (44lb) plate.

On the other hand, it‚Äôs much trickier to set up correctly a dip belt when doing rows or push ups. To do it correctly you will need to put your hands or feet on an elevated surface so that the plates can go down that level and still don‚Äôt touch the floor.

A dip belt normally costs between $20 and $30. But here it‚Äôs important to have in mind that you‚Äôll probably have to spend more with the plates. If you‚Äôve dumbbells you at least will already have the smaller plates covered. To give you some numbers a 20kg (44lb) plate can be around $25 on the lower end.

# Last but not least...

Finally, I don‚Äôt recommend you to go crazy and get all these equipment all at once. I think it‚Äôs better to add items one by one when you feel it‚Äôs the right time. Also the good thing of doing it this way is that it won‚Äôt hurt that much your pocket.

Anyways, I hope that this list helps you and you can keep progressing or start getting some serious gains from home.",2020-04-26 14:51:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g8flxd/the_perfect_calisthenics_home_gym_my_top_10/

eojoam,bodyweightfitness,Are Gymnastic Rings one of the best tool for longevity in training?

I just bought mine and been playing around with them and intuitively this does make some sense to me. I am becoming increasingly interested in healthy posture, and longevity(both celular and musculoskeletal and articular) aspects of training, injury prevention, and optimal alignment than 'Gains and looks' and some people have said that Rings might just be the perfect tool for training way into your old age and overcoming joint pains.

117dhtx,weightroom,531 BtFI Review," 531 Bomb the Fitness Industry Review

Background

I played sports in high school and lifted but when I went to college I lost the habit. My wife and I both joined a gym a few years ago and I started making it priority after our free one on one personal trainer deal had some feedback for me that wasn‚Äôt great. I had gotten pretty chunky so I began with Starting Strength and running, both of which I enjoyed. Ended up doing a bunch of different programs and ended up training for and running a half marathon a few years back and was lifting in conjunction with my running. A few months later, I ended up hurting my back during a deadlift and couldn‚Äôt run or so anything where my back wasn‚Äôt supported so I gained a bit of weight back but my pressing got decent. Got back into it all and just kind of spun my wheels program hopping and being very cautious with my back. Pandemic hits and ended up doing some running. Really missed the lifting aspect of it all but had to do something to keep the pudge down. Ended up becoming a dad and moving into a house with a garage where I built out a home gym and have fully embraced it. I have been running and lifting in tandem for the past two years. Mostly still taking everything slow to be able to make progress in both and have longevity but still doing it nonetheless.

Leading up to the start of running 531 BtFI, I had run a Garmin 10k training plan and the SBS hypertrophy RTF 4x and wanted to focus more on getting stronger. I had felt like I stalled a bit while trying to push both and wasn‚Äôt happy with it so I wanted to focus on weights after the 10k race I had planned. I also wanted to do something that gave percentages, since I am terrible with RPE, and immediately thought of 531. I‚Äôve run it in the past but have always been a little disappointed with results which lead to not being consistent with it. It always felt like my Squat and DL would do ok while my Bench and OHP would maybe move or maybe not. I had moved away from 531 for that very reason and wasn‚Äôt knowledgeable enough to know how to appropriately add more volume and practice in. This was changed after finding the post by u/TheMightyGullet.

Program

The program: [https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rudoce/program\_review\_531\_bomb\_the\_fitness\_industry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rudoce/program_review_531_bomb_the_fitness_industry/)

I wanted to run this after reading the post and seeing the combo of BBB and BBS as well as the extra volume and power days and decided to do it after my race. You can read all about the program in the post so I will just mention what I did differently. I ran a 5k on the power and volume days before lifting and also ran a 10k on non-lifting days for the Leaders. Once I got the Anchor I switched to Low Heart Rate Training to allow for more of a focus on strength realization. I only had time for one super-set of accessories after the main lifts instead of two like mentioned. I definitely didn‚Äôt get enough walking in outside of the running days so my conditioning probably could have been better. I also didn‚Äôt track how I ate but I made protein a priority and backed off drinking a lot which probably led to the slight weight loss. I am still fat so no progress pictures, sorry team.

How it went

Results first here for your enjoyment. The estimated nature of the 1RM‚Äôs get a little wacky with some of the higher reps that I got but I used the same calculator for all of the estimations.

  

|In lbs|Pre Rep Maxes|Pre E1RM|Post Rep Maxes|Post E1RM|Change in E1RM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Squat|275x3|291|265x12|371|\+80|
|Deadlift|330x1|330|320x8|397|\+67|
|Bench|225x4|246|215x10|286|\+40|
|OHP|125x5|141|125x9|161|\+20|
|Age||31||32|\+1|
|Weight||230||225|\-5|

I posted daily updates on the Daily Thread if you want a more thorough walkthrough but I thought it went perfectly. I know I‚Äôm not as strong as most around here and I was a bit nervous to jump back into weights after having truly split my training and not focused on them as much and I was met with a pretty darn good response from my body. Even though I probably had my TM‚Äôs too high for the first cycle, everything really got to moving well by the end of the first Leader and continued through to the second Leader. The only issue I had was dealing with some shoulder stuff after higher volume OHP and Bench days but that was relatively easily remedied by facepulls and more thorough warm ups for those movements.

I had hit the 1000 lb club earlier in the year last year but knew my strength had dropped off so I was very pleased to put almost 200 lbs on the big three total to get me back over 1k and 20 on my OHP. I still want a bit more which brings me to‚Ä¶

Things going forward

I have taken inspiration from 531 BTFI and combined FSL, BBB, and BBS into a 3x week lifting and 3x week running program to see how long I can ride this train. I know I can‚Äôt handle this volume forever so I am planning to back off after a bit. For running, everything is LHRT to allow myself to keep my conditioning up somewhat for lifting without hard runs getting in the way of recovery. I am doing a lot of supersets and giant sets and have spread out the accessories across all 6 days to allow for everything to fit into my available timeframe. My goal is to do 3 cycles of this and have a test week to see how I do (break 1100 lbs would be nice) and then back off on the volume, increase intensity and start ramping up on the running a bit leading into the summer. If anyone has any successful hybrid programs they are doing combined with running then I would love to hear about them!

Thank you u/TheMightyGullet for sharing your creation! I appreciate anyone who read this far and happy lifting!",2023-02-20 16:53:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/117dhtx/531_btfi_review/

_________Example of What's in the Notes_________

**Quick Intro:**

These are 6 months worth of reading books, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and trying new methods of training all in my pursuit to be more fit.  That said, I've decided to share notes I've taken on the three coaches I consider to be the top teachers and doers of the strength, conditioning, and nutrition industry, whose pedigree spread across the experienced  trenches of Olympians, US Special Operations, World Strongest Man, UFC, NFL, etc --just to name a few. Now, they are by no means the holders of the gospel of fitness, nor are they the only voices worth listening to, but here's why I chose who I chose:

**Philosophy of Choice:**

* Achievements in personal fitness - need to be fit, and have fitness results in their own life. Can't be all head knowledge or studies. No book worms or science nerds without the in-the-trenches experience.
* Achievements in client fitness - need to have produced results in others lives, because knowing what works for you is vastly different than being able to identify, correct, and advance what works for others.
* Renown and respected by the community - peers need to recognize contributions to the community
* Longevity - How long have they been in the game? How long have they stayed healthy? How long have they been training clients? All important questions in establishing reputation.


**Why I Chose Stan Efferding:**

> To me, Stan is the summation of an average guy with absolute discipline who's taken the best advice from the best gurushe's personally trained with from around the world for decades, and becoming himself an absolute beast. I chose Stan because of his humble demeanor, and because he's also one of the strongest bodybuilders in the world. Additionally, he has trained the Mountain to win his first Arnolds Strongest Man 2018 this past March.

>* Blue collar guy who presents some info. No tips or tricks. Turned over every rock looking for the secret. Spent loads of money, and there is only one answer: sleep, eat, and train.
* Matt Wenning calls him ""the strongest bodybuilder on planet earth.""
* Helped get Hapthorr ""The Mountain"" diet in check, where he set records in elephant bar (1000lbs+) and bag-over-bar, and take first as Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coached various bikini competitors, NBA, NFL, MLB, UFC, etc
* Worked with Brian Shaw's diet and helped him achieve second place at Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coaching Larry Wheels (aesthetic and powerful beast) and Dan Green. 
* Has trained with almost every guru in the business, directly or indirectly.
* Former bodybuilding and powerlifting competitor. 
* Squats in the 800lbs+ at 50+ years of age.


**Why I Chose Charles Poliquin:**

> One of the first world renown and truly experienced strength coaches of the modern era. ""Research catches up to Charles,"" has been said about his bleeding edge yet common sense approach to training. While considered by a few to be the king of psuedo-science, the ironic part of this claim is that from all my note-taking from the past 6 months --from books on Green Berets to interviews with the Mountain to 3-hour long seminars with various teachers-- Charles cites his sources and explains the history of what he's talking about more often than any other individual or source I've been reading, watching, or listening.

> * One of the best and most distinguished strength coaches in the world.
* Trained various Special Operations (Seal Team 6, SAS included)
* Coached the US womens team to win their first Olympic gold in history, and defeated Japan in their 20 year reign.
* 38+ years of Olympian training across 23 different sports, went to 3 different Olympics as a coach. Also have trained various high-level professional athletes and coaches in the military, Crossfit, NFL, NHL, MLB, etc.
* Researches studies from as far back as 1890's
* Ability to recall information, facts, research papers, all to the date, location of study, and to the author/researcher, a skill second to no other fitness expert (reminds me of the level of expert recall Robert McNaramara displays in the documentary ""Fog of War"").
* Lectures around the world with book authors like Jay Papasanas, Ed Coan, and world renown athletes like Dmitry Klokov.
* Always ahead of the curve (attributed as first in the US to recommend BCAAs, fish oils, German Volume training,  tempo training, cluster training, neuro transmitter profile training, etc).
* Stan Efferding, Matt Wenning, and Mark Bell have all implemented information from Charles into their personal training, and how they train clients, and all speak highly of him.
* Has huge biceps and abs for an old man.

**Why I Chose Matt Wenning:**

> I chose Matt because of his personal and professional achievements. Hired to train various Special Operations for the military and is the first to be implemented at a large scale. His methods have reduced injury rates across the board for fire, police, and military (and thus saved money for those organizations), and is a master of training and preventing overtraining.

> * Multiple records in the squat alone, including a 1196lb squat.
* Broke 4 world records; second highest RAW at 208 class with 2204lb total.
* Works with thousands of US military, including various Ranger regiments, 4th Infantry, and paratroopers out of Bragg. 
* Developed Mountain Warrior Athlete program out of Ft. Carson.
* Clients include NFL, US Special Operations, law enforcement, fireman, professional athletes, universities, elderly (difficult to train and yield safe results) and kids with disabilities
* His training with first responders and military has reduced site budgets significantly, due to decreased injuries and insurance claims.
* Attended university in Indiana where NASA funded the strength and conditioning programs and recruited top-tier professors.
* Top ten in the world for almost two decades with no major injuries (rare in the strength industry)
* Masters degree in sports biomechanics under Dr. Kramer
* Trained closely and mentored by various powerlifting legends like Louie Simmons, Ed Coan from his teen years, and was one of the youngest to squat 900lbs

**Notes on Notetaking:**

> Each section of notes will include everything I felt was noteworthy, even if it's repeated 3 times in 3 other podcasts. I did this as people will cherry-pick which seminars they want notes on, and I don't want them to miss out on key information just because I wrote it down elsewhere. Also, rehearing the same things over and over again just works as positive reinforcement and mentally conditioning good habits. Can't hurt to hear solid advice over and over again.

> Additionally, these notes are taken as a stream-of-thought process and later revised and edited, so they may seem short, fluid, or lacking in information. I reread the notes a few times and tried to expand and clean up, but I will have missed some parts.

> **Compilation of Notes Regarding Training Women:** (work in progress)

> * For the female lifter: 10-minute walks better than 40 minute treadmill. Doesn't breakdown muscle, still helps with fat loss. 
* If on a limited calorie diet, then the caloric limit will yield results in body composition and performance based on the choice of foods, not just calorie choice. Choose nutrient rich foods like steak.
* 3oz of OJ or milk a couple times a day: liver and thyroid stimulus for metabolism. 
* Long cardio has high water demand. Sends wrong message to body: body holds on to fat to endure the longer workload. Also, body thinks heavy muscle is bad, gets rid of it.
* Stan noticed how joggers carry fat.  Body holds on to fat for fuel, gets rid of muscle. Body responds to stimulus you provide.
* Still need to develop cardio. Recommends HIIT under load: improves cardio while stimulating muscle. Weighted exercises with higher reps (why Matt and Stan recommend loaded exercise under distance). Performing 20 rep sets, or 30 second rest between weighted carries, running stairs (all concentric loading), pushing prowlers, 30s sprint/rest on recumbent bike (ten mins) are all great examples of cardio development.
* ""How do you talk people into losing weight by lifting weights?"" Cites his 60 year old women who lift weights and are lean. They don't have prior exercise experience, and they're stronger than most men.
* How much weight you have on you is 80% diet. Cardio isn't what gets bikini and stage competitors lean, it's they eat better. ""Don't want to be huge? Don't eat huge.""
* When you start training weights you start to retain water, so swelling occurs. Hypertrophy occurs, diet cleans up, everything will lean out.
* ""Foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue."" Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* Research: Sleep loss limits fat loss. Insulin resistance goes up; blood pressure goes up; hunger goes up; cortisol (breaks down muscle tissue; decreases testosterone, effects your thyroid; etc)
* Juicing and detox is completely worthless. All you can do is optimize how your body filtrates toxins, which is the liver. Best way to detox is to just not put the processed foods and oils into your body.
* 10 minute walks for athletes wanting to gain weight, with caloric gain. Also female competitors in bikini, but with calorie deficit. Helps digestion and insulin resistance. 
* Stan trained 40-50 minutes morning, 30 mins at night.
* Women tend to restrict and end of missing much needed fats and nutrients. Ability to absorb nutrients depends on using fats as a shuttle.
* ""*There's no black and white, there's only gray. Find out what fits you and do that*""
* States foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue. Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* If not yet deserving then stick to glutamine, amino acids, and whey. Losing body fat will make you more insulin sensitive.
* Steady-state cardio will cause you to get fatter. 
* Restricting fats causes fat. Fats help with insulin sensitivity.
* **Common mistakes with trainers and female clients:** not wanting to get strong. Not enough time on overload with women (don't have goals for strength). Short term goals to comply to regarding big lifts. Lean muscle tissue leads to insulin sensitivity.
* Believes most women in the gym are busy, not productive 
* Better glute development: split squats, squats, deadlifts (all of which develop horizontal and vertical jump). 



**TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:**

There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.

1. **Carbs:** Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. 
3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
5. **Warm-Up:** Static stretching isn't the best option prior to a lift, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. Here's the warm-up in practice with Mike O'Hearn, Stan, and Matt. 
6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption.",2022-07-26 16:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/w8njnr/heres_70_pages_of_notes_ive_taken_from_20/

s8rf8d,weightroom,"RIP AND TEAR Program Review, and Discussion of Program Development.","**Introduction**: 

This week I am finishing the last week of my 12 week program, Rip And Tear. This post is going to take a look at the program, my run of it, and then cover some general thoughts about writing programs. 

I like to start every post I write with a brief overview of the sections included in the post so that readers can know what they are getting into and skip to what the want if they don‚Äôt have the attention span to read a few pages. 

*The Results*: This section is just a brief look at the results of the 12 weeks, mostly strength focused. 

*The Program*: This section will go over the program itself, with focuses on what it contains/ is designed to accomplish, who should run it, and some of my inspirations. It will also include a link to the spreadsheet for the program. 

*My Run*: This section will look at my experience running the program, what I liked about it, what I changed, and other aspects of my 12 week run. 

*How and Why to Write a Program*: The last section will look at what goes into writing a program. Why you should or should not do it, when you should consider it, and how to go about it. 

**The Results**:
Here are some of my results from the program, which is probably the part of most interest to many of you: 

Squat: [465 x 12]( https://youtu.be/0R6zViHMR0A), [500 x 10]( https://youtu.be/r1E3OkvdVTo),  [405 x 20](https://youtu.be/I7djdphzDK8), [525 x 10 Box]( https://youtu.be/0p_ZoMgI5VM), [655lb Box]( https://youtu.be/hI4P6J2Kb3I)

Bench Press: [365 x 4]( https://youtu.be/PYy_hxCpXLw), [415 x 1]( https://youtu.be/OpG-8_e6NTY)

Deadlift: [700 x 10]( https://youtu.be/TNfy-v5d92M) [800 x 3](https://youtu.be/WYshrJyg1oM)

Other: [805lb Deadlift 360]( https://youtu.be/_PQjjCKAqjU), [2 x 405lb Deadlift]( https://youtu.be/5Mrn8aDsvKg), [330lb Double Steinborn Squat](https://youtu.be/uQ3RPE2nIec), [365lb Single Leg Deadlift]( https://youtu.be/0zijYggfP-4), [365lb Scott Lift]( https://youtu.be/PYejvw04VTE)

Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift sets are all (or at least almost all) on program. The other lifts are side things I was able to do over the course of the program. 

I bulked for the entire period of the program but do not have specific weight numbers to share as I no longer find tracking my weight to have a purpose. I went from ~265 to ~275, give or take on both sides. 

I do not have before and after pictures, I am at a point where I could count the pounds of muscle I can expect to gain in a year on one hand, so I do not look for difference on a bulk to cut basis. [Here are some pictures from October for reference]( https://imgur.com/a/8NhJXWa). I have a strong sense of what is or is not an effective hypertrophy workout and I judge my success in that area by how many good hypertrophy workouts I can get in. I understand this is both subjective and internal, but you will have to take my word for it when I said that I was able to maintain solid and effective hypertrophy work through the 12 weeks. 

**The Program**: 

Rip And Tear is a 12 week program focused around high frequency, moderate volume, high weight Squat, Bench and Deadlift. [Here is a link to the Spreadsheet]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C4yiw7uNw1LSPlvWMDNnIlHcVQhXMzV4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104236994809501726559&rtpof=true&sd=true). Please do not ask for access to the master copy. Just make a copy for your own use. 

*Features of the program*: 

This is a 4-7 day program. It includes 3 bench days, 3 squat days, and 2 deadlift days a week. It covers programming only for these three lifts. All accessory work and the bulk of the hypertrophy work is up to the user. If you are not comfortable handling this aspect of your training yet this program is not for you. This program will also feature work for the same body parts on back to back days. If you do not have the work capacity or will to do that then this program is not for you.

The program is divided into 3 blocks that are 4 weeks each. Intensity ramps through each block then resets at the beginning of the next block. The primary mechanism of raising intensity is by an increase in weight used. This is coupled with a lowering of reps and increase in sets in most cases. Weights will reach as high as 90% of 1RM for working sets, and will go no lower than 70%. The highest rep range programmed is 7 reps, the lowest is 1. This is a program where you will be working with heavy weight. Weights are based off of a true 1RM. Do not use a training max, do not use an old PR single, pick a weight that you could confidently perform a single for at the beginning of the program. 

Every week except for the first week of each block features an AMRAP (as many reps as possible) set for each of the three lifts during the week. These AMRAPs are not used to moderate progression, progression is locked to your initial 1RM entries. These AMRAPs should be used to push yourself without fear of inflating future week‚Äôs weights. At the same time they are ultimately optional, all that is required on the final AMRAP set is the minimum reps. You are encouraged to use your best judgement and regulate yourself as needed. Keyword *needed*, not *wanted*. The final AMRAP of each block is dealers choice on weight. This is a chance for you to push for specific PRs if you so desire. 

Only 4 days a week include programmed lifts. The remaining 3 are listed as rest or hypertrophy days. How these days are used is up to you. I recommend at least 1 of these days be used for upper body hypertrophy work. Ideally a second one be used for extra work on small, quickly recovering muscles (shoulders, calves, arms, etc). I would not recommend using all three for lifting, save at least one for full rest. 3 of the programmed days include suggestions for additional hypertrophy work. You can choose to skip these if wanted, or work a different area. Again I want to stress that all accessory and hypertrophy work is *up to you*. 

*Who/What this Program is for*:

This program is designed to give you a framework for your Squat Bench and Dead (SBD) while leaving you room to still develop yourself through accessory/hypertrophy work. The high frequency on the SBD lifts and heavier weights will improve your specific strength on heavy SBD. If this is something you want, then this program might be for you. If you don‚Äôt care about heavy SBD then I hope it goes without saying but this program might not be for you. You should have a strong competency in these three lifts before attempting this program. If your technique is inconsistent or if it puts some stress on the body in an inappropriate way the high number of sets will exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to injury. **This is not a beginner program, this is not an ‚Äòintermediate‚Äô program**. This is program for experienced and competent lifters with a good handle on SBD.  

This program is probably best suited for periods of weight gain. You could potentially run it while cutting with appropriate moderation of your additional work but it goes against [my philosophy on cutting]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qj1ntt/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cutting_phases_by/?ref=share&ref_source=link). I would not suggest running this program back to back. I run a program like this once a year, and will probably continue to do so for the immediate future. It is a good opportunity to improve your SBD technique, while still leaving enough room and energy for an effective bulk. But it‚Äôs a very specific kind of stimulus and if you only train in this manner you are leaving a lot on the table. 

If you want to use an appropriate substitute for any of the three lifts you can. A trap bar deadlift would be fine to swap with the barbell deadlifts. A floor press would be an appropriate swap for the bench press. A leg press would not be an appropriate substitute for the squats. Etc. This lets the program be customized for individual preferences and limitations. You do not need to lift strictly barbell SBD to powerlifting standards for this program to be effective, but again *use your best judgement on substitutions*. If you have to **ask** if something is a reasonable substitute it probably is not. 


*Where the program came from*: 

This program is most heavily inspired by Layne Norton‚Äôs PH3. I ran PH3 at the end of 2019 and 2020. I ran it as written in 2019. I ran it with [modifications]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tCi26oYp8GvT7bJuoTGDvbqy8mazemFxD02Nl4xaFRQ/edit?usp=sharing) in 2020. I wrote about my thoughts on PH3 [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/eiz8uf/program_review_ph3/). In short, I felt that it was not suitable as written for the majority of lifters. The only population I thought could effectively keep up the loads and progression were those with substantial muscle and strength, but limited experience with lower rep, high weight SBD. Basically a population that was physically equipped for big lifts but missing the specific technical skill, leading to deflated 1RMs. Granted, *this is exactly who Layne wrote the program for*, so I can‚Äôt blame him for that. But I really liked the spirit of the program and wanted to adapt it for myself and a wider population. My first set of changes brought it into line a bit, I was not nearly as beaten up at the end of that run as I was the first, but it still wasn‚Äôt quite there. It also did not click with my current philosophy on bulk programming. 

Instead of further tweaking I decided to just take the aspects that I wanted to preserve, high frequency SBD with big weights, and rebuild from the floor up. I kept the core of the program (the 3x4 week structure, the split, and the positioning of the AMRAPS) and dumped pretty much everything else. I changed the percentages, the reps and sets, and removed the AMRAP based progression scheme. I also drew inspiration from Greg Nuckols 28Free Program Builder, with the increased weight coupled with lower reps but higher sets, as I really enjoyed that set up. 

I should also credit whoever was the original author of the PH3 spreadsheet on LiftVault, as I used the bones of that spreadsheet for this one. 

I credit DOOM for the name of the program. 

**My Run**: 

*Accessory/Hypertrophy*: 
I ran 2 additional hypertrophy days, one Upper-body and one Arm day on Days 7 and 4 respectively, with Day 2 as a full rest day. I initially took days from John Meadows Gamma Bomb for hypertrophy but quickly just started performing them how I wanted, using the GB workouts as inspiration only. 

On programmed days my additional work would look something like this: 2-3 sets of 2-5 movements, usually super-setted or giant-setted. I performed some arm work on Day 1, Leg work on Day 4, and Upper body on Day 5. I performed a more intensive Leg day on day 6. I did not keep movements consistent week to week, I performed whatever I was feeling like each day. 

*Changes, Choices, and Modifications:*
-I started with 585/405/785 S/B/D 1RMs.

-I cut the programmed squats on Day 6 pretty quickly. They did not really mesh well with how I wanted to run the rest of my hypertrophy leg days and hypertrophy took the priority over a bit if extra technical practice. 

-I skipped the deads on Day 1 as needed. Sometimes my back was just too fatigued for my heavy forward lean low bar and deadlifts back to back. I do not really need the technical practice on deadlifts, and saw little value in forcing uncomfortable clunky reps. 

-I took AMRAP sets either to PR or attempted PR, or to the minimum. I reasoned that if I was not in good enough shape to push for my best I was better off controlling my fatigue so I could keep up my hypertrophy work. 

-At one point I tweaked a knee on failing an off program lift. I skipped one sessions worth of squat and dead, then used block squats to just above parallel for the remainder of the program. 

-After the 415lb bench PR I felt a small pinch between my pec and my shoulder at the bottom of heavier bench reps. I subbed in floor presses from this point onwards. 

(I want to note that both of these injuries were basically gone in ~2 weeks and had a total impact of making me use some variations. Stop being terrified of injuries folks. Shit happens when you are trying hard). 

-I did a *lot* of off program nonsense over the 12 weeks. This seems to have a pretty minimal negative impact on my training. 

*Additional Notes and Thoughts*: 
During this bulk I consumed ~6,000 calories a day. I cut out my 5k rows the first week due to a head cold and never reintroduced them. I walked 6 miles with my dog most days, with that being reduced 3 miles or 0 miles on very cold days as I realized that I was barely gaining weight regardless of all the food, so there was little reason to try and expend more energy. 

Days 1, 3 and 5 I lifted in my basement. Days 4, 6, and 7 I lifted at the gym. I lift from ~9-11am, some days taking less some days taking more. 

I felt that every day‚Äôs programmed weights were challenging, but doable. Even on a bad day I could complete my reps if I put my mind to it. On the original program, near the end there was stuff I just could not do. Even during the first week where I had some very stuffy sinuses and a very dry throat I managed, including the first squat PR listed above. 

I think that I did betray my bulk philosophy a bit. My goals should have been primarily on the hypertrophy work, making sure that I left energy for these sets every day. But there were many instances where I had the potential to set a squat or deadlift PR and taking that set took the edge of my subsequent work. All the nonsense work also probably did not help. But ultimately I *wanted* do these things and that is what matters. 

I was very happy with how well box squats and floor presses, two movements I had never done before, slotted in when I needed them. The longer I workout the more I find that no specific movement is really needed and that expanding your horizons to try new variants and movement patterns ultimately pays off into similar lifts. I used to throw myself against barbell squat, bench and deadlift, terrified of any back slide. I kept the same training style and focused on the same accessory movements. This culminated in my least productive training year plus, where my SBD total increased 15lbs, or maybe even 10lbs with an arbitrary chip of a squat PR. It sucked, I was not excited to lift, I was not progressing, I worried that I was just done getting better. Then I sucked it up and tried a totally different type of program. I was forced to make more changes to how I worked out by the pandemic. I started trying other variants and goofing around with nonsense lifts. I took breaks from focusing on barbell SBD and it massively paid off. Since that plateau I have added almost 200lbs to my total and am confident I have room to grow on all three of the lifts. I realize I have gone on a bit of a tangent here but I think it is a valuable perspective. No matter what your goals are, or what you think that they are right now, a wider scope of training style, movement selection and programming methodology will help you. It‚Äôs good for your original goals, lets you experience new things you didn‚Äôt know that you liked and helps with training longevity, both physically and mentally. [I expand on these ideas a bit here, to plug some more reading.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qj1ntt/how_to_make_the_most_of_your_cutting_phases_by/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I don‚Äôt think anything needs to be changed before I run it next year, which I still plan to do. I am comfortable changing things as necessary, which means I can adapt to my needs in the moment anyways. Seeing as this program is directed to experienced lifters, I think that if you run it you can probably make changes within reason as well. Just take ownership, if you want to change something make sure you are confident about it. If you aren‚Äôt, you probably should not be modifying your programming. 

**How and Why to Write a Program**: 

This last section I want to cover some of my thoughts on writing your own programming. A lot of people *want* to do their own programming, but I do not think most of them *should*. If you are in the category of people who can successfully manage it, I‚Äôll give some general ideas on it. 
My first outing in writing my own programming was the plateau year I described above. I ran something I wrote for over a year and I ended up with jack shit to show for it.
 I had just finished almost three years of random bro split into nSuns 531 into nSuns CAP3, and I felt that I had outpaced both programs, but did not want to shift to something totally different. So I took a very loose understanding of 531BBB, and hit it with a hammer until it was a pile of scrap that covered 6 days a week. I did not know what I was doing, why I was doing it, and I had only every experienced one flavor of programming. Turns out that 531BBB is not meant to be a 6 day program. Doing 531 sets + 5x10 + accessories 6 times a week, doubling up on SBD and cutting out OHP is not a good programming decision. 
But I was not going to let that stop me, I was going to run that ship fully aground over the course of a year and wonder why I was not getting anywhere. I cannot stress enough that I did not know what I was doing and that I had zero business writing a program after only three years of training and in only one style. *Do not be like me*. This is not me telling you that I am special and can write programs and you are not so you can‚Äôt. This is me explaining my own personal failings in that endeavor so that you might understand why it might not be a good idea for you. 

So what has changed between then and now? Well now I have another 4ish years of experience with a variety of programs, including my failed program. I have a much firmer grasp of what does and does not work for me, and what my training philosophies are. I have much more nuanced ideas of what my goals are and how I can reach them. I am thinking in programming blocks, not in just in perpetual consistent training. I am much more experienced and have a much greater knowledge of how things work, and how they don‚Äôt work. The only thing that can give you the above is time under, over, around or otherwise in the vicinity the bar or other heavy object. I do not believe you can effectively ‚Äòstudy‚Äô these things from a theoretical perspective, particularly when it comes to you as an individual. 

What is the best way to accumulate this experience? Train with a large variety of someone else‚Äôs programs. Try to pick programs that are radically different, or at very least from different people in different disciplines. Even as I tell you this there are plenty of areas I have not looked into yet. Even if you want to be like me and run programs that generally gravitate around SBD, you should at least run a lot of different SBD based programs in order to broaden your perspectives on how to train these movements. No two experienced coaches are going to have the same outlook, and by experiencing their programming you gain the benefit of their unique approach to training. As you gather this firsthand experience, pay attention to what you like and don‚Äôt like. What works for you and what does not. These are the aspects you are going to want to take, or leave, in your future programming. 

So now you have run at least 10 different programs, you‚Äôve been at this for quite a few years and have a pretty solid grasp on how you operate, and *you have results to show for it*. Are you ready to write a program? Maybe. *Should you?* Well that is a totally different answer. Ask yourself these questions: 

*‚ÄùWhy are you writing a program‚Äù*: The answer probably should not be ‚ÄòBecause I just want to‚Äô. I can‚Äôt stop you if this is your only reason, but it‚Äôs not really a good one. There are people better at this than you, and they are offering up their programs. You will almost certainly be better off just picking one that aligns with your needs and using that. A better answer to this question is ‚ÄòBecause nothing I have found quite meets my current needs‚Äô. Now you are getting somewhere. Generic programs are just that, generic. This does not mean that they are bad, but it means that they are meeting relatively broad needs so as to apply to a wide audience. A custom program does not need to do this, it can focus on as narrow and obscure a goal as you want it to. It can be tailored to your needs and wants. Why did I write Rip and Tear? Because I wanted to run PH3 again, but PH3 was not really compatible with me. No other program that I knew of had the parts of PH3 that I wanted but with more compatibility. 

*‚ÄùCan you just modify an existing program‚Äù*: As a follow-up, if you have a unique need, can you fulfill it by just taking a program and making some minor changes? As far as I am concerned there is no shame in working off someone‚Äôs programming homework and changing it just enough that the teacher does not notice. This was my first step, as mentioned above. I tried modifying PH3 before writing Rip and Tear and still didn‚Äôt quite get it where I wanted it. 
*‚ÄùWhat is your program going to do, and how‚Äù*: Even if you have identified that no program can meet your needs, with or without modification, you still need to be able to explain to yourself how your proposed program will meet those needs. How are you going to structure your program so that it helps you reach your goals? What is is going to look like, in broad strokes, and why are those strokes going to lead towards your success? If you can‚Äôt explain why your program will work, it probably isn‚Äôt going to do so. In my case this was an easy question to answer. I wanted to lifted heavy SBD a lot. So all my program had to do was contain a lot of heavy SBD sets. If your goal is more specific or based on an actual result, you might have a harder time with this question.

*‚ÄùWhat are you basing your program on?‚Äù*: I don‚Äôt think that anyone should just sit down with a blank piece of paper and completely create a brand new program from scratch. The experience you are leveraging to write this program came from other programs. *Use those*. Take chunks of other programs shamelessly. Nothing is original, even if you do make up everything in your program it‚Äôs still going to end up copying parts of someone‚Äôs programming. Don‚Äôt make more work for yourself, work with the enormous body if existing programming. As I have also mentioned above I drew from both PH3 and 28Free when writing Rip and Tear. 

*‚ÄùWhat are you going to call your program‚Äù*: All the good programs have cool names based on cool shit like superheros, heavy metal, giant robots, or puns. If you are going to write a program you have to name it something suitably intense to properly represent how powerful it is. I named my program Rip And Tear [because it‚Äôs intense]( https://youtu.be/NgAm664NloA) [as shit]( https://youtu.be/zZMg9ryeWOw). 
If you have established that you can make a program, should make a program, and know what‚Äôs going into it, here are a few final thoughts:

-Everything does not need to have to have a precise reasoning. I just picked percentages because they looked reasonable. I picked 2.5% jumps because it seemed like a good number. Why did I up the jump to 5% for the 3rd week? I accidently typed it that way in week three and decided that it looked alright to me. This was all totally fine because the precise percentages don‚Äôt really matter that much. A little lower and I would probably just get higher AMRAPs and have more juice for accessories. A little  higher and it would be the opposite. Neither is a big deal. 

-Along similar lines you should have a good sense of what your program is going to do, and a reasonable sense of how it‚Äôs going to do that, but the precise mechanisms aren‚Äôt super relevant. You don‚Äôt need to stress over having a double undulating bilateral progression scheme or a reverse pyramid step back looping progression, or whatever the influencers pretending to be eggheads are talking about. Is the program moving generally forward in some manner? That‚Äôs probably good enough. You should know several progression schemes that you like from the experiences you gathered. Just pick one. Adding specific movements to your program? Just pick some, I promise the choice between a banded floor press versus a chained block press wont make or break your programming. Focus on the large scale, not the small scale. Your foundation matters, what color you paint the walls does not.  

-Don‚Äôt be afraid to audible. If you realize a third of the way in that something is not working change it. You aren‚Äôt going ‚Äòoff program‚Äô, you wrote the damn thing, you are *editing* it. If you have the experience necessary to write a program you have the experience necessary to make judgement calls to change things mid-program. Frankly the later requires less experience than the former. 

**Conclusions**:

I think I have covered everything I wanted to here. Again this is clocking in at north of 4k words so thank you for reading this far if you did. I will answer any questions in the comments to the best of my abilities. I am planning to work through a radically different custom program in the spring and will hopefully work out a similar writeup when I complete that.",2022-01-20 19:53:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/s8rf8d/rip_and_tear_program_review_and_discussion_of/
auotxl,weightroom,"Program Review: nsuns 531, 5 day","**Lifting History:**

I'm 27, 6'1"", 189lbs and been lifting for around 2 years. I started with ICF 5x5 for around 6 months. Then the beginner 3 day, full body 5/3/1 for around 8 months until I started to feel a bit beat up. Then I did reddit ppl and played basketball a lot. Not really focusing on getting stronger during ppl, just wanted to recover my beat up body and not push the main lifts as hard.

I ran nsuns 5/3/1 variation for 3 months with 2 deload weeks, one because of the flu and one regular deload. This is my first resistance program I've run since getting off the keto train for the last 2 years (240lbs down to 185lbs) because I thought I needed more carbs to push my body harder and build muscle.

**Results:**

Starting weight: 186lbs

SQUAT: 330 e1rm

BENCH: 235 e1rm

DEADLIFT: 370 e1rm

OHP: 145 e1rm

Ending weight: 189lbs

SQUAT: 345lbs x 3 reps

BENCH: 255lbs x 2 reps

DEADLIFT: 455lbs 1rm

OHP: 175lbs 1rm

**Modifications:**

I superset a lot with antagonistic exercises because of limited time before work and I wanted to increase my work capacity.

T1 supersets:

Between bench press on day 1 and day 5, I superset 9 sets of rows with bench. Typically at a lower weight than my bench for 8 -12 reps. Switching between overhand barbell rows, underhand barbell rows, and one arm dumbell rows. I really focused on squeezing at the top. I would do a higher rep set at the end for muscle burnout. Rowing and trying to build my back were a big focus of mine for this program. I superset 9 sets of 5(weighted)-10(bodyweight) reps of pull ups/chins on OHP days. Superset ab wheel and hanging leg raises between squat and deadlift.

T2 supersets:

front squat/sumo, superset with machine/tbar/pendlay rows

incline/ohp, superset with lat pulldowns (to give my elbows a break from chins/pullups), and facepulls

Accessories: as laid out in the program, lots of weighted & bodyweight dips, lateral raises, glute ham raise, hamstring curls, bicep curls. Didn't keep track of these too much. Just did them at the end of my workouts for burnout. On day 5 after bench/close grip bench I did a lot of farmers walks. 
 
**Cardio:**

2-4 days a week, nothing too hard on my body. Elliptical, airdyne bike, and 2 mile walks with my dog.

**Injuries:**

My ass/upper hamstring. Something weird going with my upper hamstring where it inserts into my ass. I think it was from pulling sumo for the first time using muscles I haven't worked before. I stopped doing sumo's 2 months into the program so I wouldn't hurt myself further. Focused on my RDL's and GHR's instead.

Upper quad. I felt tightness for around a week or 2 on my upper quad where it inserts into my hip on the outside of my hip. I did my top set of 345 for 2 reps then was working back down at 255x5 when I felt something tear or rip in my high upper quad. There wasn't a lot of pain, but enough to know I should stop. I deloaded the next week with no squats. I plan on going to the dr for this to see what the hell happened.

Pectoral. I think from all the benching I have mildly strained my left pec where it inserts into my shoulder. I did this my 2nd to last week. It feels fine when I OHP or incline, so I did those only. No flat bench the last 2 weeks.

**Conclusion:**

I enjoyed it, lots of variation. Adding a lot of rowing has made me thiccer for sure. I think my traps have grown from the farmers walks. I lost a good bit of fat around my midsection and can see the top of my abs which I've never seen before. My deadlift and squat were really shooting up until I had to stop squatting. My deadlift continues to feel great. Supersetting has increased my ability to do work. 1 arm dumbell rows are no joke at 7-9 sets of 10-12 reps in between benching on day 5. Overall, I'm happy with the progress I made. Pissed about getting hurt.

**Future:**

Going to start running the 6 week Prep and Fat Loss program outlined in 5/3/1 Forever in the next coming weeks. Really want to challenge myself to continue to build my work capacity, and lose some more fat before vacation. After that, I was thinking about 5/3/1 Building the Monolith, or 5/3/1 BBB but we'll see how I'm feeling.

One other thing that I would like to mention or inquire about. I've started listening to Matt Wennings podcasts and youtube videos. How in the fuck did he and everyone he trains at his gym not get injured and have ridiculous totals? I've been bit by the lifting bug and I know longevity is extremely important to having a high total. But for him and his clients, I just find it crazy to the progress they made without getting hurt/no serious injuries ??

If anyone has any advice, etc I would be glad to hear it! This is my first program review. I appreciate it if you got this far.

4/4 2pm MST Update: Check back for notes on sumo deadlift form checklift, squat form checklist, vertical diet summary, and an updated women's advice section.

**Quick Intro:**

Over the past 6 months I've been reading books, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and trying new methods of training all in my pursuit to be more fit.  That said, I've decided to share notes I've taken on the three coaches I consider to be the top teachers and doers of the strength, conditioning, and nutrition industry, whose pedigree spread across the experienced  trenches of Olympians, US Special Operations, World Strongest Man, UFC, NFL, etc --just to name a few. Now, they are by no means the holders of the gospel of fitness, nor are they the only voices worth listening to, but here's why I chose who I chose:

**Philosophy of Choice:**

* Achievements in personal fitness - need to be fit, and have fitness results in their own life. Can't be all head knowledge or studies. No book worms or science nerds without the in-the-trenches experience.
* Achievements in client fitness - need to have produced results in others lives, because knowing what works for you is vastly different than being able to identify, correct, and advance what works for others.
* Renown and respected by the community - peers need to recognize contributions to the community
* Longevity - How long have they been in the game? How long have they stayed healthy? How long have they been training clients? All important questions in establishing reputation.


**Why I Chose Stan Efferding:**

> To me, Stan is the summation of an average guy with absolute discipline who's taken the best advice from the best gurushe's personally trained with from around the world for decades, and becoming himself an absolute beast. I chose Stan because of his humble demeanor, and because he's also one of the strongest bodybuilders in the world. Additionally, he has trained the Mountain to win his first Arnolds Strongest Man 2018 this past March.

>* Blue collar guy who presents some info. No tips or tricks. Turned over every rock looking for the secret. Spent loads of money, and there is only one answer: sleep, eat, and train.
* Matt Wenning calls him ""the strongest bodybuilder on planet earth.""
* Helped get Hapthorr ""The Mountain"" diet in check, where he set records in elephant bar (1000lbs+) and bag-over-bar, and take first as Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coached various bikini competitors, NBA, NFL, MLB, UFC, etc
* Worked with Brian Shaw's diet and helped him achieve second place at Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coaching Larry Wheels (aesthetic and powerful beast) and Dan Green. 
* Has trained with almost every guru in the business, directly or indirectly.
* Former bodybuilding and powerlifting competitor. 
* Squats in the 800lbs+ at 50+ years of age.


**Why I Chose Charles Poliquin:**

> One of the first world renown and truly experienced strength coaches of the modern era. ""Research catches up to Charles,"" has been said about his bleeding edge yet common sense approach to training. While considered by a few to be the king of psuedo-science, the ironic part of this claim is that from all my note-taking from the past 6 months --from books on Green Berets to interviews with the Mountain to 3-hour long seminars with various teachers-- Charles cites his sources and explains the history of what he's talking about more often than any other individual or source I've been reading, watching, or listening.

> * One of the best and most distinguished strength coaches in the world.
* Trained various Special Operations (Seal Team 6, SAS included)
* Coached the US womens team to win their first Olympic gold in history, and defeated Japan in their 20 year reign.
* 38+ years of Olympian training across 23 different sports, went to 3 different Olympics as a coach. Also have trained various high-level professional athletes and coaches in the military, Crossfit, NFL, NHL, MLB, etc.
* Researches studies from as far back as 1890's
* Ability to recall information, facts, research papers, all to the date, location of study, and to the author/researcher, a skill second to no other fitness expert (reminds me of the level of expert recall Robert McNaramara displays in the documentary ""Fog of War"").
* Lectures around the world with book authors like Jay Papasanas, Ed Coan, and world renown athletes like Dmitry Klokov.
* Always ahead of the curve (attributed as first in the US to recommend BCAAs, fish oils, German Volume training,  tempo training, cluster training, neuro transmitter profile training, etc).
* Stan Efferding, Matt Wenning, and Mark Bell have all implemented information from Charles into their personal training, and how they train clients, and all speak highly of him.
* Has huge biceps and abs for an old man.

**Why I Chose Matt Wenning:**

> I chose Matt because of his personal and professional achievements. Hired to train various Special Operations for the military and is the first to be implemented at a large scale. His methods have reduced injury rates across the board for fire, police, and military (and thus saved money for those organizations), and is a master of training and preventing overtraining.

> * Multiple records in the squat alone, including a 1196lb squat.
* Broke 4 world records; second highest RAW at 208 class with 2204lb total.
* Works with thousands of US military, including various Ranger regiments, 4th Infantry, and paratroopers out of Bragg. 
* Developed Mountain Warrior Athlete program out of Ft. Carson.
* Clients include NFL, US Special Operations, law enforcement, fireman, professional athletes, universities, elderly (difficult to train and yield safe results) and kids with disabilities
* His training with first responders and military has reduced site budgets significantly, due to decreased injuries and insurance claims.
* Attended university in Indiana where NASA funded the strength and conditioning programs and recruited top-tier professors.
* Top ten in the world for almost two decades with no major injuries (rare in the strength industry)
* Masters degree in sports biomechanics under Dr. Kramer
* Trained closely and mentored by various powerlifting legends like Louie Simmons, Ed Coan from his teen years, and was one of the youngest to squat 900lbs

**Notes on Notetaking:**

> Each section of notes will include everything I felt was noteworthy, even if it's repeated 3 times in 3 other podcasts. I did this as people will cherry-pick which seminars they want notes on, and I don't want them to miss out on key information just because I wrote it down elsewhere. Also, rehearing the same things over and over again just works as positive reinforcement and mentally conditioning good habits. Can't hurt to hear solid advice over and over again.

> Additionally, these notes are taken as a stream-of-thought process and later revised and edited, so they may seem short, fluid, or lacking in information. I reread the notes a few times and tried to expand and clean up, but I will have missed some parts.

> **Compilation of Notes Regarding Training Women:** (work in progress)

> * For the female lifter: 10-minute walks better than 40 minute treadmill. Doesn't breakdown muscle, still helps with fat loss. 
* If on a limited calorie diet, then the caloric limit will yield results in body composition and performance based on the choice of foods, not just calorie choice. Choose nutrient rich foods like steak.
* 3oz of OJ or milk a couple times a day: liver and thyroid stimulus for metabolism. 
* Long cardio has high water demand. Sends wrong message to body: body holds on to fat to endure the longer workload. Also, body thinks heavy muscle is bad, gets rid of it.
* Stan noticed how joggers carry fat.  Body holds on to fat for fuel, gets rid of muscle. Body responds to stimulus you provide.
* Still need to develop cardio. Recommends HIIT under load: improves cardio while stimulating muscle. Weighted exercises with higher reps (why Matt and Stan recommend loaded exercise under distance). Performing 20 rep sets, or 30 second rest between weighted carries, running stairs (all concentric loading), pushing prowlers, 30s sprint/rest on recumbent bike (ten mins) are all great examples of cardio development.
* ""How do you talk people into losing weight by lifting weights?"" Cites his 60 year old women who lift weights and are lean. They don't have prior exercise experience, and they're stronger than most men.
* How much weight you have on you is 80% diet. Cardio isn't what gets bikini and stage competitors lean, it's they eat better. ""Don't want to be huge? Don't eat huge.""
* When you start training weights you start to retain water, so swelling occurs. Hypertrophy occurs, diet cleans up, everything will lean out.
* ""Foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue."" Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* Research: Sleep loss limits fat loss. Insulin resistance goes up; blood pressure goes up; hunger goes up; cortisol (breaks down muscle tissue; decreases testosterone, effects your thyroid; etc)
* Juicing and detox is completely worthless. All you can do is optimize how your body filtrates toxins, which is the liver. Best way to detox is to just not put the processed foods and oils into your body.
* 10 minute walks for athletes wanting to gain weight, with caloric gain. Also female competitors in bikini, but with calorie deficit. Helps digestion and insulin resistance. 
* Stan trained 40-50 minutes morning, 30 mins at night.
* Women tend to restrict and end of missing much needed fats and nutrients. Ability to absorb nutrients depends on using fats as a shuttle.
* ""*There's no black and white, there's only gray. Find out what fits you and do that*""
* States foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue. Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* If not yet deserving then stick to glutamine, amino acids, and whey. Losing body fat will make you more insulin sensitive.
* Steady-state cardio will cause you to get fatter. 
* Restricting fats causes fat. Fats help with insulin sensitivity.
* **Common mistakes with trainers and female clients:** not wanting to get strong. Not enough time on overload with women (don't have goals for strength). Short term goals to comply to regarding big lifts. Lean muscle tissue leads to insulin sensitivity.
* Believes most women in the gym are busy, not productive 
* Better glute development: split squats, squats, deadlifts (all of which develop horizontal and vertical jump). 



**TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:**

There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.

1. **Carbs:** Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. 
3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
5. **Warm-Up:** Stretching is apparently a waste of time, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. Here's the warm-up in practice with Mike O'Hearn, Stan, and Matt. 
6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption. 

Edit: lot of questions about this topic specifically, so I rewatched the video. It's about the 1:25:00 of the Komplettes seminar. Didn't specify the amount of fructose and dextrose. Just says a scoop of dextrose and some OJ. I'd recommend 3oz oj since he always used that number.",2018-04-04 19:29:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/89snua/heres_41_pages_of_notes_ive_taken_from_22/

2rb64t,weightroom,limiting weight for joint longevity?,"Over the last few years, I've built up to doing working sets with 2x bw on squats, 2.5x bw deadlift, 1.5x bw bench. These are good numbers for me, 'cause I've got some shitty distance-runner genetics (very small frame, bodyweight of 150, very slow-twitch dominant, etc). 

However, I just turned 40, and have noticed that my injury rate has slowly been getting worse for the past few years, even with careful warmups & prehab exercises. Strained adductors, lower back, shoulders - and they taking longer and longer to heal. 

I'd like to be active when I'm _really_ old, so I'm thinking of dropping the load and upping the reps, Jack Lalanne-style.

Older lifters (or anyone else), is there a rep range or weight limit that you favor to minimize the chance of injury while still remaining usefully strong? 

Are there any studies that look at this?",2015-01-04 16:46:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/2rb64t/limiting_weight_for_joint_longevity/
voadw,weightroom,Balancing Shoulders in Texas Method,I just finished reading Justin Lascek's e-book on the Texas Method and it was incredibly informative. He suggests alternating chin-ups and pull-ups on Monday (volume day) after benching/pressing but there's no horizontal pulling in the routine at all if left this way. I was under the impression that it was better for shoulder longevity to balance a horizontal push with a pull so will this present issues down the road? ,2012-06-27 06:48:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/voadw/balancing_shoulders_in_texas_method/

1lojpue,longevity,Seeking longevity researchers for brief interviews: How microgravity research could advance aging science,"**TL;DR: Author researching microgravity applications for longevity science. Seeking 15-minute interviews with aging researchers (no space background needed). ISS has hosted 3,000+ bio experiments; commercial stations coming in 2030s.**

Hi r/longevity community,

I'm Robert Jacobson, an author investigating how microgravity research platforms could benefit terrestrial longevity science. I'm looking to interview researchers in longevity & aging fields - **no space research background required**.

# Why this matters for longevity research

The International Space Station  conducted nearly 3,000 biological experiments from 4,200+ researchers across 100+ countries over the past decades. With multiple commercial space stations planned for the 2030s, these platforms may become more accessible research tools.

Current microgravity research relevant to aging includes:

* **Accelerated cellular aging processes** \- cells exhibit different aging patterns in microgravity
* **3D tissue engineering without scaffolds** \- gravity-free environment enables novel tissue construction
* **Therapeutic development** for age-related conditions using unique microgravity properties

  
Patents mentioning ""microgravity"" grew from 21 in 2000 to 155 in 2020, indicating increasing scientific and commercial interest.

# What I'm looking for

**15-minute conversations** with longevity researchers about:

* Current research challenges that might benefit from novel approaches
* Whether microgravity environments could potentially enhance their work
* What would make space-based platforms accessible and valuable



# What you get in return

  
Aggregated insights from other expert interviews

* Acknowledgment in future presentations
* Access to findings about emerging research opportunities

  
**No space research experience needed** \- I'm interested in your  expertise and fresh perspective on these platforms.

Mods approved  me posting this request. If you're a researcher or know one who be interested in a brief chat, please comment or DM.

Thanks for your time and consideration

1locmvp,longevity,"Meet Jim O‚ÄôNeill, the longevity enthusiast who is now RFK Jr.‚Äôs right-hand man","When Jim O‚ÄôNeill was nominated to be the second in command at the US Department of Health and Human Services, Dylan Livingston was excited. As founder and CEO of the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI), Livingston is a member of a community that seeks to extend human lifespan. O‚ÄôNeill is ‚Äúkind of one of us,‚Äù he told me shortly before O‚ÄôNeill [was sworn in as deputy secretary on June 9](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/jim-oneill-sworn-in-as-deputy-secretary.html). ‚ÄúAnd now \[he‚Äôs\] in a position of great influence.‚Äù

As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‚Äôs new right-hand man, O‚ÄôNeill is expected to wield authority at health agencies that fund biomedical research and oversee the regulation of new drugs. And while O‚ÄôNeill doesn‚Äôt subscribe to Kennedy‚Äôs most contentious beliefs‚Äîand supports existing vaccine schedules‚Äîhe may still steer the agencies in controversial new directions.¬†

Although much less of a public figure than his new boss, O‚ÄôNeill is quite well-known in the increasingly well-funded and tight-knit longevity community. His acquaintances include the prominent longevity influencer [Bryan Johnson](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/05/1116090/bryan-johnson-new-religion-body-is-god/), who describes him as ‚Äúa soft-spoken, thoughtful, methodical guy,‚Äù and the billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel.¬†

In speaking with more than 20 people who work in the longevity field and are familiar with O‚ÄôNeill, it‚Äôs clear that they share a genuine optimism about his leadership. And while no one can predict exactly what O‚ÄôNeill will do, many in the community believe that he could help bring attention and resources to their cause and make it easier for them to experiment with potential anti-aging drugs.¬†",2025-06-30 16:51:20,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/30/1119449/hhs-robert-f-kennedy-jr-jim-oneill-longevity-maha/?utm_medium=tr_social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=site_visitor.unpaid.engagement
