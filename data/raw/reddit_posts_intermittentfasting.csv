1m6fcqt,nutrition,The real secret of low obesity rate in East and Southeast Asia. It's not genetics or poverty.,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology\_of\_obesity#/media/File:Obesity\_rate\_(WHO,\_2022).png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_obesity#/media/File:Obesity_rate_(WHO,_2022).png)

It's water. Seriously, that's it.

Every few years, Western media cycles through the same tired diet trends: keto, paleo, intermittent fasting, carnivore, “cut the carbs!”  while completely missing the glaringly obvious factor that keeps much of East and Southeast Asia lean despite high-carb diets: **the cooking method**.

Nowhere else in the world eat like Asian. This is the land of noodle soups, steamed dumpling, steamed buns, hot pot, stews, curry, all sorts of water sauces and fermentation in brines. Almost all of the cooking methods revolves around water: steaming, boiling, brining, braising. No other countries outside of the region has so many dishes where water makes up most of the volume, EVEN THE DESSERTS ARE SOUP. Compared to the rest of the world where the most popular cooking method is frying, baking, grilling etc... All these methods remove moisture and to prevent the food from drying out, that moisture is replaced with fat: oil and dairy. Effectively making all foods denser than it has to be.

Let's take some example. A grain of rice is 70% water by volume after it's cooked. In fact, the short grain asian rice retains more water than other parts of the world where the rice is drier and only contain about 60% water. A liter of pho is about 1200g with about 500-600 calories while a burger is about 300g with 700-900 calories. And often a burger comes with fries and sugary drink to satiate your hunger, people don't often need to drink anything while eating pho.

Vietnam tops the list as having the lowest obesity rate in the world with the most water-centric meals out of all asian countries. Vietnamese people will eat some sort of noodle soup or rice soup for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Growing up, we had a bowl of vegetable soups every single meal. If you go to vietnam and eat a home cooked meal, it's often served with the broth that's just leftover from boiling vegetables. Even almost all the sauces are water-based. Hot pot is the rage all over asia. China's dim sum is literally all steamed dishes for breakfast and lunch. ALSO DESSERT SOUP. Seriously, please look into this. These are literally the healthiest dessert stuff in the world without sacrificing taste.

Edit: One thing I forget to add. Oil and water don't mix. So when often cooked with a lot of water, oil separates from meat, into the water. A lot of asian culture often wash the meat by parboiling it to remove the scum and impurities so the broth look clean, this also ends up removing a lot of the fat. Oil also float the top of all soupy dishes so it's easily removed.",2025-07-22 14:19:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1m6fcqt/the_real_secret_of_low_obesity_rate_in_east_and/

1gw0o3d,nutrition,Using the threshold amount of protein synthesis per day and the calories expended to synthesize it as a parameter for defining a diet is an appropriate approach?,"**First of all**, I ended up adding other things to the post besides my question, I apologize for diverting the emphasis of the post, but my intention besides promoting a good discussion and analysis, also involves sharing experience and knowledge

this starts from a precept based on the new ideas and refutations that current science has shown us, in general promoted by Milo Wolf and Mike. this includes: high volume, hard bulking and others. Which led me to think about adopting an approach based on the amount of protein I synthesize and the energy expended to eat only what is necessary to generate hypertrophy and have healthy gains / recovery without compromising vitamin / mineral shortages, hormonal health, and still having the possibility of intermittent fasting (which in turn promotes an increase in gh and igf-1) to have an advanced sensory and body perception and connection (results obtained by me were: consistent vigor, mitigated stench, all senses more refined especially smell, no loss of muscle mass noticed, even being ""ectomorph).

**Back to the topic:**

according to some superficial research:

we synthesize 5 to 8 grams a day (I believe there are people who have a larger margin) and synthesis uses **4 to 5 calories per gram of protein**. Therefore, to synthesize 7 grams of protein, the body would spend approximately: 7 g×4 kcal/g= 28 kcal

which is a very low amount, i.e. unless we cause a lot of muscle damage (leading to more energy expenditure) synthesis will certainly happen, so we can stop worrying about the idea of catabolism (which is more mediated by bad health and stress than food itself)?

\- thinking in this way we can eat only what is necessary (and avoid contamination, inflammation and not overloading our entire digestive tract)

\- delayed gains almost always come from overtraining, or non-optimized training

\- another point of view is that the body isn't ready for this, we're not bears that hibernate in winter

I believe that bulking will only contribute to the idea that the person is ""growing"", but they will be gaining muscle and more fat. But not with the actual BMI.

But in your opinion, evaluating your points of view, data, and the veracity of what has been said, is this an appropriate approach?

a very low amount as you can see, when the body is healthy, it doesn't need too much energy to meet general demands (even fasting improves this by eliminating old cells that consume more energy).

Getting off topic again, I believe that a metabolic approach is stupidly efficient for increasing gains, using mechanisms such as: improving nitric oxide production through beet, improving mitochondria, and myochondrial genesis (more ability to absorb energy = better).

some parameters that health books generally use to portray virility also involve lung capacity (the more oxygen storage, the better overall functioning)

but generally a total maximization approach ends up not being as (but not totally) impactful, as removing everything that causes damage to the body, resolving which is undoubtedly the biggest game changer",2024-11-20 22:05:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1gw0o3d/using_the_threshold_amount_of_protein_synthesis/

The idea of intermittent fasting is that you are only allowed to eat food during a specific time interval throughout the day. I have heard that this has many benefits, but I'm not here to get into the potential benefits of fasting.

I have also heard that people who work night shift tend to gain weight due to hormonal imbalances, and other factors.

My question is, does it matter at what time of day you consume your calories?

I have also read IF does good things for the body like raises IGF-1, which may be good for fat loss.

There are so many different processes that happen in the body that it's a bit confusing to a layperson.

As a student, I’ve found it really cost and protein effective to go to the grocery store, get a “meal deal” for £3.50 (about $4.40), which gets you a sandwich, snack and drink. I aim for high protein, and I get 70g of protein in it, with about 740 kcal, which is awesome.

I’m also intermittent fasting 16/8 so I leave without breakfast, buy 2 meal deals, and take a protein shake with me(2 scoops, 48g, 440kcal)

Is this healthy/ maintainable for my long term health, or should I reduce the amount I do this?

Is store bought food 3-4x a week going to be bad for me or can I safely keep at it due to its low cost and makes it easy to meet macro goals.

However, I've practiced a couple other forms largely as a form of convenience while traveling, although also with the express goal of losing weight. Both of these methods seem to be working, but I wanted to hear from others about them. I don't know what sort of research is out there about fasting in general.

1. Dinner-only (typical IF)
2. Miss _random_ meals.  Maybe you skip lunch, which is pretty normal to be fair, but maybe you eat breakfast and lunch, skip dinner, then only have lunch the next day. The idea here is that your body doesn't get used to a set eating schedule, preventing it from going into ""starvation mode"" where it conserves calories until you eat again.
3. Don't entirely skip a meal, but eat something closer to a snack as replacement.

So, what happened? Is it just a cultural trend type of thing? Has there been a recent shift in the literature? How did this meal evolve from one level of importance to almost the opposite?

riqgbk,nutrition,2021 Dietary Guidance to Improve Cardiovascular Health: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association,"The latest consensus statement from the AHA was published last week and can be found entirely free at https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001031

Abstract

Poor diet quality is strongly associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. This scientific statement emphasizes the importance of dietary patterns beyond individual foods or nutrients, underscores the critical role of nutrition early in life, presents elements of heart-healthy dietary patterns, and highlights structural challenges that impede adherence to heart-healthy dietary patterns. Evidence-based dietary pattern guidance to promote cardiometabolic health includes the following: (1) adjust energy intake and expenditure to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight; (2) eat plenty and a variety of fruits and vegetables; (3) choose whole grain foods and products; (4) choose healthy sources of protein (mostly plants; regular intake of fish and seafood; low-fat or fat-free dairy products; and if meat or poultry is desired, choose lean cuts and unprocessed forms); (5) use liquid plant oils rather than tropical oils and partially hydrogenated fats; (6) choose minimally processed foods instead of ultra-processed foods; (7) minimize the intake of beverages and foods with added sugars; (8) choose and prepare foods with little or no salt; (9) if you do not drink alcohol, do not start; if you choose to drink alcohol, limit intake; and (10) adhere to this guidance regardless of where food is prepared or consumed. Challenges that impede adherence to heart-healthy dietary patterns include targeted marketing of unhealthy foods, neighborhood segregation, food and nutrition insecurity, and structural racism. Creating an environment that facilitates, rather than impedes, adherence to heart-healthy dietary patterns among all individuals is a public health imperative.

Also, for the curious, note the comments on keto and intermittent fasting on CVD which is frequently discussed on this sub:

Some heart-healthy dietary patterns emphasized in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans include the Mediterranean style, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style, Healthy US-Style, and healthy vegetarian diets.5 Research on dietary patterns that used data from 3 large cohorts of US adults, the Dietary Patterns Methods Project, found a 14% to 28% lower CVD mortality among adults with high compared with low adherence to high-quality dietary patterns.6 However, most research on dietary patterns has been conducted in Western populations; future dietary guidance would benefit from research in non-Western countries. *There is insufficient evidence to support any existing popular or fad diets such as the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting to promote heart health.* 7,8

Figure 1 provides a simple and concise list of recommendations to lower CVD risk and can be used as a summary of the findings.",2021-12-17 20:44:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/riqgbk/2021_dietary_guidance_to_improve_cardiovascular/
qih4iy,nutrition,"How many calories can the body absorb at once? And following this, is CICO always relevant?","If someone (person A) were to eat 3000 calories throughout the day (breakfast, lunch and dinner), would more of these calories be absorbed by the body than someone (person B) who eats all 3000 calories in 1 meal?

Both of these people are eating the same amount of calories, yet surely person B is absorbing less of the 3000 calories than person A. 

Im asking because people often write-off intermittent fasting because the main relevant factor in weight loss is “calories in calories out”. However, if this example is correct and person B is absorbing less than person A, (despite eating the same amount) would this not demonstrate that food timing is also an equally relevant factor in weight loss?

Edit : Thanks everyone for your responses, they're all really helpful. It seems that most people are suggesting that your body absorbs 100% or close to 100% of the food you put into it, which would discredit the premise of my example.

q1h4pk,nutrition,Fat loss without low carb diet or intermittent fasting,"I've seen some medical professionals, such as Dr. Jason Fung, claim that fat loss only occurs when glycogen stores in the muscle are mostly depleted and insulin levels are very low, such as after fasting.

But plenty of bodybuilders and fit people don't follow a low carb diet and don't do intermittent fasting (quite the opposite - they eat small meals every 3-4 hours). I would guess their muscle glycogen levels remain fairly high and their insulin levels remain moderate.

However, these folks are still able to lose fat, as long as they eat enough protein in their diet, keep training, and maintain a caloric deficit.

This seems to conflict with the advice that fasting and/or low carb is the only way to burn fat. So my question to redditors is what really controls when fat is burned vs. when muscle glycogen is burned for energy. I don't doubt that having low insulin levels helps shift the balance to more fat burned, but clearly many folks are successful with fat loss even on high carb diets.

m8izts,nutrition,Our prehistoric eating habits," 

So i was watching an old joe rogan podcast video (forgot which one, i watched a couple of weeks ago) and something stuck with me. a doctor on the podcast claims that before agriculture, humans were nomadic and had to hunt/gather to get food. because of this, they sometimes went several days without eating food. like they might hunt a couple of animals in a week and see no more animals for the rest of the week, so they ate a lot in the first week and not that much after. and since they were nomadic, their diet was extremely varied. Maybe a couple of months they ate only meat (lean meat, organs, skin) and next months they would eat veggies and grains only. He also said that we like sugary/fatty food because it was limited back then, so if we found them, then we would be awarded with good taste. but nowadays, since their is an abundant amount, we eat too much of it. I was looking into this guy in other videos and he says that humans didn't have access to a lot of carbs back then either, so even eating a piece of bread a day is unhealthy.

He said because of this, he eats basically one big meal a day and sometimes goes days without eating (so i guess intermittent fasting?).

I practice intermittent fasting and have recently decided to increase my protein intake substantially. I go to to work at 6:30 AM and typically have my first meal at 4:00 PM. It took me a long time to find my perfect lunch box which basically includes the following:

* A bowl of mixed greens with a light dressing (balsamic vinegar & olive oil) on the side
* 2 grilled cheese sandwiches in Saj (Markouk) bread
* A fat handful of sliced coloured peppers and cucumbers
* A handful of almonds and walnuts
* An apple

This is the best combination of foods that I could think of that would be nutritious and safe to eat given that they'd be out of the refrigerator for quite some time. However, I've recently started weightlifting and I need to increase my protein intake significantly. Obviously, foods like eggs and meats are out of the question since they'd be out for so long so I've been trying to find some protein-rich foods that wont spoil by 4:00 PM. I don't want to double or triple my almond intake because they're quite dense in calories and also they'd get pretty boring pretty quickly. It's worth noting that I store my lunch in a *thermally insulated* lunch bag; however, I try not to rely on that too much.

le5brr,nutrition,Would it be better to eat fewer meals heavier on carbs vs more meals but lower in carbs for good insulin/blood sugar levels?,"First off, I'm wondering if there's any rule on how many grams of (complex) carbs you should/can eat in one meal and still keep being insulin sensitive (prevent insulin resistance (IR)/type 2 diabetes (T2D)). Also, my question kind of stems from intermittent fasting (IF)... Because, if people who do IF skip breakfast they basically skip a meal. So that would mean that they would ""have to"" eat fewer meals, but higher in carbs, during the day (and yes, I know people have different diets and it doesn't HAVE to be like that, but let's say that is in fact the case). I also know that some people already eat high calorie diets so they can skip a meal without compensating for it, but my question is more targeted to people that wouldn't meet their caloric needs if they skipped a meal without compensating for it in the meals they don't skip.

I've heard IF is good for blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity, but I have also heard that meals heavy on carbs are not good for blood sugar. I am really confused on what would be the best approach for people to prevent IR and T2D regarding this. 

So, is there a definite threshold or something on how many grams of carbs a meal can contain without affecting blood sugar/insulin in a negative way? And as the title says, is it better for blood sugar/insulin to actually have meals lower in carb, but eat more meals during the day.. Or fewer meals (as in IF) but that each meal is a bit higher in carbs?

ji33lo,HealthyFood,Are Yasso Greek yogurt bars good for you?,"The title pretty much says it all, but a little background about me:

Im a 21F and am currently cutting by doing intermittent fasting and eating caloric deficit. Currently I’m at 145lb and my goal is to get to 120, at a steady pace of -1.5lbs/week. For the most part I have been on track and have not eaten any sweets whatsoever. I’m currently trying to eat less than 1288 calories a day.  I saw there are frozen Greek yogurt treats that taste good (I’ve had them before) and I was wondering if they are good for you? Or if anyone has any experience or opinions on it? As long as I stay within the 1288 I figured I’d be good, but if anyone has any other insight I’d love to hear it?

i5qkug,HealthyFood,My cravings and how I overcame them,"Hey all,
So I used to do Intermittent Fasting and would eat my first meal around noon or 1:00, and then would eat a snack and dinner within my allotted eating window. I never felt like I was being overly restrictive- eating about 1500-1600 cals as a female. But, every night after dinner I would crave and crave and crave something sweet. It would start with one piece of chocolate and quickly turn into anything I could get my hands on- peanut butter, tortilla chips, random crap. But recently I’ve changed up my schedule and have loosened my deficit. I now eat breakfast around 8:00, even if it’s just something small, and then work out. I stopped fasting and increased my calories to around 1700-1800. As someone who is very active, I IMMEDIATELY felt better. I had more energy, my cravings were rare and not very strong, and I was able to eat when I was hungry. I felt better during workouts. I am still in a moderate calorie deficit, and continuing to lose weight. But it’s just been such a burden off my shoulders. Anyway, if you’ve been struggling with binging or cravings, I suggest changing things up a bit. At first, I was scared that increasing my calories would lead to me gaining weight. But instead, I’m losing MORE weight because I have stopped eating 500+ calories after dinner 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ never even noticed I was being too restrictive.",2020-08-08 01:36:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/i5qkug/my_cravings_and_how_i_overcame_them/

cuju30,HealthyFood,Looking for healthy breakfast ideas!,"Hi everyone!

I am looking for recommendations for healthy breakfast. Details:

I currently never eat breakfast. Not sure why, but food just doesn't appeal to me before 10am, usually. Some people would call this intermittent fasting or whatever, but I just worry it's not a healthy way to go.

Part of the problem is that, with my job, I often forget to eat lunch too... then I come home ravenous and have, like, 2 dinners. 

So yeah, not a healthy pattern. I am looking to lose a bit of weight, so I don't really want to increase my caloric intake, but I just thought having a modest breakfast in the morning might have a better metabolic effect than what I am currently doing.

Oddly enough, I bloody love food, work in a bar/restaurant and eat for free, so it's sort of a weird pattern to be in.

If anyone has any healthy, maybe high protein, low carb breakfast recipes they are keen to share, that would be great! I prefer savoury to sweet.

1) What do you eat to help you feel fuller?

45i7hd,HealthyFood,cognitive dietary restraint,"Have you previously been a more self-restricting eater (not necessarily eating-disordered, but just generally restricting) and found a way to be more balanced towards your approach to food? If so, how did you do it? 

I decided to post here because after seeing all these paleo/whole30/keto/intermittent fasting trends, I had to reflect... I feel like I don't relate very well to the American attitude towards food. It's so all-or-nothing, rigid, extreme. Every other week, there's a new ""superfood"" or a food that allegedly should be shunned. It feels like dieters are almost trying to invent a new religion or something. I am living in the United States, so I think that some of the attitudes towards eating have unfortunately rubbed off on me. The term for this-- ""dietary restraint"" -- which is when people (usually women, I guess) consistently try to monitor and somewhat limit their food intake -- certainly resonates with me. I feel like actually, the best diet I have ever had was when I stopped going on a diet and just ate when I felt hungry, and stopped when I felt full. I didn't pay attention to whether it had carbs/flour/sugar/dairy/whatever, I just ate when I felt like it. 

In other countries, it feels like food is simply a way to unite the family, some time to relax and enjoy with others and catch up on the events of the day, and they're just fine. ... Any thoughts?",2016-02-13 02:12:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/45i7hd/cognitive_dietary_restraint/

1ejwyxa,Fitness,42 Male Cancer Survivor 8 Months Progress ,"Start: 190lbs 8 Months: 154lbs

Around 3 Years ago in the summer of 21 I was diagnosed with stage 4b rectal cancer. I was 39.

Underwent 2 years of treatment which included radiation, chemo and 4 Surgeries. I had my 4th and hopefully final surgery in Sep of 23, I am currently in remission.

I used to workout in my 20's but lost track of my fitness and allowed myself to reach 36 waist size.

  
**Progress Pics:**

I don't know why i took this pic but this is me post covid, i probably weighed like 220+ at this stage

[https://imgur.com/a/ronPlvk](https://imgur.com/a/ronPlvk)

This is me in Feb of 24 - [https://imgur.com/a/u9b3FA1](https://imgur.com/a/u9b3FA1)

This Pic is from July 6th - [https://imgur.com/a/eK61dsX](https://imgur.com/a/eK61dsX)

I just wanted to help my body heal and repair the damage from the 2 years of treatment and made a commitment to myself to try and do some workout and hopefully make it a habit.

**Diet:**

**Dec - Feb:** The most important change was my diet, I was asked by my surgeon to start taking a high protein and as low carbs as you can diet to try and combat some post radiation issues in my GI tract.

I did intermittent fasting for 16 hours from 7pm - 11am

First Meal - Chicken/Fish , Sauté vegetables(more colors the better), 1 Bowl Fruit

Second Meal - Greek Yogurt With Handful of Almonds, 2 Ripe Banana's

Third Meal - Grilled Chicken/Baked Salmon, 2 Slice Sourdough Bread



**Feb - Current** : I stopped doing intermittent fasting and added a whey isolate protein shake. I target to eat my third meal before 7:30 pm each night

Right After Workout - Whey Isolate Protein Shake, Overnight Soaked Almonds

First Meal - 2 Whole Boiled Eggs, 2 Whole Boiled Egg white only, Greek Yogurt/Cottage Cheese

Second Meal - Chicken/Fish , Sauté vegetables(more colors the better), 1 Bowl Fruit

Around 3-4pm - Whey Isolate Protein Shake

Third Meal - Grilled Chicken/Baked Salmon, half cup or full cup of wild/brown rice.

**Exercise Routine:** 

I started with r/bodyweightfitness  minimal routine and a self made warmup routine in the third week of Dec 23. Following was the routine

Warm-up

All of these were done for 30sec - 1 min

Seiza

Deep Squat And Hold

Bear Walk

Crab

Horse Stance

Dead Hang

Minimal Routine

I did this like a circuit on an average i did 4 per day

Push Up

Squat(bodyweight)

Low Row(Two Bedsheets in a door)

Plank

Jumping jacks

I did this routine with a goal to be able to do 10 push ups 20 squats 10 low row 1 minute plank 35 jumping jacks.

Around Feb of 24 I started noticing some changes in day to day energy levels and it just felt good and my post radiation issues were also easing down.

I was not able to go to gym yet since i was still dealing with a lot of post treatment issues and i wanted to be able to challenge myself without needing to buy weights as I live in an appt.

Did some research and bought a cheap squat rack from amazon and a pair of gymnastics rings, parallettes, a set of resistance bands. The squat rack was for hanging the rings and getting a bar to do pull ups.

I went with a modified version of the beginner routine from r/bodyweightfitness wiki the warmup routine remained the same except i removed the dead hang.

All Pairs in Supersets with a 90 sec rest in the pair and 60 sec rest for the core superset pairs.

3 sets - rep number changed throughout, the below numbers are what i am doing currently

Pull Up - 5

Squats(Bands) - 10



Ring Dips - 8

Ring Hamstring curls - 15



Ring Inverted Rows - 8

Decline Push Up(parallettes) - 10



Core Superset

Hanging Knee Raises - 10

Palof Press - 10 each side

Superman - 10



I now have access to a gym and was wondering what would be a good program to start my goal is to build strength and get down to 14-18 % body fat range.

I was looking at the 5/3/1 for beginner and liked this following routine

Day 1:

– Superset Bench with: DB Row, Planks

– Superset Squat with: DB OHP, BW Bulgarian Split Squat

Day 2:

– Supserset OHP with: DB Curls, Paloff Press with Band

– Superset DL with: Pushups, DB Lunges

Day 3:

– Superset Squat with: DB Rows, DB Swings

– Superset Bench with: DB Lateral Raises, Leg Raises (on bench)

a set of  main lift, a set of both accessories, then rest 90s.

I plan to swim for 30 mins on rest days

**Diet**
My diet wasn’t anything I tracked, I had irritable bowl syndrome and one of the alternative methods of treatment I attempted on my own that I found to work wonders for me in multiple levels of this was intermittent fasting. My fasting schedule aloud me to eat 5 hours out of the day. I would front load with a dynamotized protein with extended release at the beginning of my window and at the end of my window which totaled to 120 grams of protein. I cut pop completely from consumption. I do a gallon of water At least a day. I attempt to eat every hour for the 4 hour window period I have and the results with my overall body composition as well as my IBS really did wonders. Oddly enough I did not really “track” my diet but stuck very strict to the fasting window. 

Example day-to-day meals:

Fast: 20 hours-
- only water

Eat: 4 hours-
- 60 g protien shake

- chicken breast/steak/fish
- broccoli/ asparagus/ salad

I can say I have noticed a difference in the size of certain muscle groups and I am open to critique and criticism (I welcome it as I’m trying to truly take this to the next level). Things I have noticed more so than size is strength in my lower half but size really hasn’t followed. This could potentially be in part because of the fasting but I am not positive. 

My goals moving forward:

- put on more muscle and size in my quads and hamstrings 
- find a bit of an alternative diet that allows me to grow a bit as I feel I’m limiting myself size wise with the fasting but am not sure if that is the reason

[Post workout pics](https://i.imgur.com/7GSlvYP.png)

It’s been just over two years since I started my fitness journey, mostly powered by the inspirational posts here and in other fitsubreddits, so figured I would contribute in case it inspires someone else. (using a throwaway account since my main has identifying info)

**Background:**

I was pretty sedentary for most of my life, not really into sports or physical activity of any kind. As I was approaching 30 I could feel my body slowing down, and going to a physical checkup made me a bit worried with my overall health especially with potential heart and diabetic genetics. So in early 2018 I decided to make a change.

**False start:**

I didn’t want to join a gym because I didn’t want to embarrass myself, so I started just by walking and occasionally jogging. Also bought myself a pull up bar and some bands. I don’t even know why I got a pull up bar because I didn’t even know how to train for it (although it would come in handy during a future quarantine). This wasn’t very helpful as I lacked the discipline and commitment to do this myself. After a few months of going no where, (plus some life changes) I decided to sign up with a personal trainer/gym.

**Start:**

I didn’t really do much research on gyms/trainers, I just wanted to start, so I found a nearby gym that had good enough reviews and signed up for 3 months. Figured paying money for a trainer was good motivation to keep going. I lucked out because the trainer I was assigned was pretty good at working with my fitness level. For the first month or so it was mostly cardio (treadmill walking) and bodyweight training, with some dumbbell work thrown in (starting at like 8lbs) 3 days a week. I’m glad it was a slow start because in the first two weeks there were multiple times that I ended up puking during the workout (I was pretty unfit). This was in July (and when the before pic was taken).

**3 months in:**

They do say it gets easier, and after the first month I wasn’t feeling as sick during workouts and I was able to go on a regular basis. I never missed a day, and I started doing walking/jogging on the off days. 3 months in I did notice a major change in mindset; I no longer had to force myself to go to the gym, I started going on autopilot.

**Diet:**

My trainer had me go on an intermittent fasting diet at the start, and we were doing weekly weigh-ins. I lost about 30 pounds in the first 3 months. I hated the diet because I thought eating healthy meant eating bland. I didn’t fully commit to what he laid out, but I was able to commit to the fasting, which definitely helped with the weight loss.

Around November, I started keeping track of my weight and started messing around with what I ate. I used an app called [fitmencook](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fit-men-cook-healthy-recipes/id980368562) which allowed me to make more interesting meals, and I used the calories in that to get a rough sense for how many calories I was consuming with each meal. It probably wasn’t very accurate but I was continuing to lose weight so I didn’t care too much about the accuracy.

**7 months in:**

I was feeling pretty great with my overall health, and even more impressed that I was able to commit to working out on a regular basis. However, paying for a trainer is not cheap, and it wasn’t something I could continue to do long term. But by then I was almost doing things by myself anyways. I knew what areas would be worked on each day, and what sort of exercises needed to be done, so figured it was time to move on. During the last month with the trainer I actually asked him to show me use of barbell exercises. During this month I signed up for a commercial gym and started going two days a week. So I was now working out 5 days a week.

**April through November 2019:**

I started following the [PHUL](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout) routine for a month or two and then followed with a [PHAT](http://simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) routine after that, because I enjoyed doing SOMEthing everyday of the week (weekends was for complete relaxation) Both routines are great, but I realized that I might be missing something in how I was progressing because I was increasing weight whenever I felt like it, and my form was suffering because of it. Chose both routines because they came recommended in the wiki; I just wanted something that told me exactly what to do without me having to overthink things.

**November 2019 through Mar 2020:**

After hearing about nSuns on reddit I decided to try it out. I never wanted to attempt it because It seemed like a LOT of volume, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted spend more than an hour at the gym. However having the progression built in was pretty helpful, plus really helped me focus on my form. I did end up spending more than an hour just doing weights, I had stopped running or doing any form of cardio entirely.

The values below are calculated from the [nSuns app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nsuns-5-3-1/id1265494052) and I never actually attempted my maxes, which is fine because gaining a lot of strength was not a huge priority for me. I also ran into some knee trouble, and basically stopped doing squats starting in January.

* Bench: 115 > 180
* Deadlift 220 > 295
* OHP 80 > 120
* Squat 150 > 215

[nSuns progression graph](https://i.imgur.com/6knUa9j.jpg) (zoomed in to show the values, so November is cut off)

**Quarantine:**

Once quarantine started I started doing the [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_strength_work_.2840-60_minutes.29) from r/bodyweightfitness. I think the pull up bar was the best accidental purchase I made, because it came in REAL handy during this time. I also got myself a pair of rings which I hung off the pull up bar to do things like rows. Going to purchase some dumbbells+belt so I can continue to increase my weighted pull-ups and use it for things like curls. I started doing some skill stuff like L-sits and handstands. I also got back into running and finished the [C25K](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/c25k-5k-trainer/id485971733) app. Then graduated to [C210K](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/10k-trainer-by-c25k/id511600311) and now I’m working on the 13.1 app.

Workout schedule:

* M/W/F(mornings) - Recommended routine
* T/T/S (mornings) - Running 5, 2, 10+ miles and focusing on increasing mileage
* Daily (evenings) - Stretching/yoga in the evenings
* Sunday - Rest

Some current achievements:

* \~10 weighted pull-ups (+35lbs using a backpack filed with books)
* \~10 pseudo planche pushups
* \~10 tucked ring rows
* \~2 sec kickup handstand (near a wall rather than completely freestanding)
* \~20 sec L-sit
* 12mi run in about two hours (9.50min/mi)

**Quarantine diet:**

Almost completely cut out eating out (for obvious reasons) so I started using [MyfitnessPal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718) to keep track of calories and to hit my protein goal (currently maintaining at 2000 calories with a protein goal of 126g). The recipes feature in MFP was a game changer when I discovered it as it was helpful when I started experimenting with different recipes. I do not track on the weekends, but I don’t necessarily go overboard either. Sticking to the calorie goal has intuitive taught me how much food I should be consuming, plus I can be flexible if I do end up eating out indulging in some treats.

**What’s next:**

The initial goal was losing weight, but currently it’s more about sticking to the routine and maintaining a balanced lifestyle. I never thought I would ever have the look of my current body. Not that it’s that impressive compared to what I’ve seen on here, but definitely something I’m happy with, and it's something I can probably maintain going forward. Having some goals is helpful to making progress (Want to do things like planche, levers, handstand walks…). Once gyms open up again in my area I will prob do a 3 day full body routine to start and continue with the running which I actually sort of enjoy now.

**Takeaways:**

* Getting into the habit is more important than waiting for motivation. Figure out what can get you started into a routine.
* If the goal is general fitness/weight-loss, then the exact routine, macros, accessories…etc don’t matter all that much as long as you do SOMETHING. I think people (including myself early on) tend to overthink this.
* Start small, start slow; give your body time to adapt. The weight, the speed, the intensity can increase over time.
* Accurately tracking calories is important for weight loss, especially after the initial drop of just eating less. Those 1tbsp of oil (\~120 calories) do add up over time.

fla1ka,Fitness,Here's a timeline of my fitness journey.,"TL; DR: I wasn't happy about my state and was uncertain about how to begin. I was all over the place and didn’t know what I was doing, the best thing I did was to get out of my head, over myself, and start. As a result, I ended up acquiring so much more than I could ever imagine.

**October 2017:**

Age: 29
Height: 5’7”
Weight: 185lbs

I started going to the gym

2-3x a week

Cardio: 5-10 mins at a comfortable pace, just enough to break a sweat.

20-25 mins on various machines.

Stopped completely after the 2nd week.

**December 2017:**

I saw a video, US Navy Admiral, William McRaven gave a speech about starting your day off by making your bed. I can’t remember which friend shared it but thank you. I was once in the military so this hit me real hard. Where’s the officer in me now? What the hell happened? I had an honest conversation with myself and I was disgusted that I gave up so easily. I went to the gym every day for a month until January.

*Workout:*

I worked on muscles that weren’t sore from previous workouts, utilizing basic machines. I mostly worked on the chest, back, biceps, triceps, shoulders.

During this month, there were days where I was sick, weak, and not feeling it at all, I still went anyway. On separate occasions I’ve spent only 5-10 mins on random machines, a few push-ups/pull-ups, I’ve spent < 10 seconds at the gym only to weigh myself and then leave.

*Lifestyle/Diet:*

My caloric intake was terrible because I was consuming anywhere between 3500-4500 calories a day with minimal movement. I knew I had to start with my eating habits, I didn’t want a diet, I wanted a lifestyle. Dieting didn’t make any sense to me because I didn’t want any dietary restrictions, I wanted a lifestyle that works for me, one where I get to eat and cook anything oily and flavorful without worrying if it would hinder my progress. I began ordering half of what I usually do when I ate out. I ate half of my usual portions.

E.g. 4 bowls of rice + various entrees per meal => 2 bowls of rice + leftovers for my next meal.

I love food a lot, I enjoy eating out and trying new restaurants. Ordering enough to feed 4+ people and finishing all of it in a sitting is my usual. I also enjoy cooking, my fridge, pantry, and cabinets are always full of food. I only throw out food that I don’t eat or can’t fix in the kitchen.

**April 2018:**

*Workout:*

3-5x a week for 1hr 30 mins.

Stopped cardio.

90% upper body exercises with machines. I included different exercises I found on [bodybuilding.com](http://bodybuilding.com/) and modified some of them to my preference, mostly for experimenting.

*Lifestyle/Diet:*

Started intermittent fasting, My window was 2 pm – 12 am. I ate out a lot for dinner, this included fast food runs especially when there was a deal. I loved the $1 Menus from Wendys, McDonalds, Taco Bell, Burger King, spicy dark meat only family meals from Popeyes. I would combine a bunch of patties and avoid some of the bread, when I ate 7 pieces of fried chicken, I would eat only 3-4 pieces of fried skin. I also developed a love for white sauced based pizzas, especially with unlimited toppings.

3000 - 3500 calories/day

* I don't usually do desserts except for specific chocolates and chocolate ice cream on special occasions \~1 - 2x a month.
* I snack at least 3x a week at night, I eat popcorn, cheetos, doritos, and more. I limit myself to 300-500 calories a day. I break this rule oftentimes, and I'll readjust my calories accordingly by eating 0.5 bowls less of rice the next day, 6 fewer pizza rolls or 1 slice less of pizza depending on what I eat. I  can't tell you the exact calories, but estimating calories is a skill I've acquired during my journey.
* Things I eat/cook :
   * My main proteins are beef, chicken, eggs, pork, lamb, fish, shrimp, squid, clams. I have most of these in my fridge/freezer at the same time and use some or all of them in my cooking. All Costco.
   * I don't always cook from scratch to save time, but it's still tasty as hell for sure.

*Goals:*

* Workout < 6 am
* Perfect my form for all exercises.
* Increase time spent on calisthenics from 30 – 40%.
* Allocate more time for free weights, rely less on machines.
* Find some way to incorporate squats.
* Hold a vertical handstand for > 40 seconds consistently.
* Straight front lever (currently at 70%).
* Straddle planche (70%).
* One arm pull-up (\~50%).
* Variations of getting to a vertical handstand, Pike, L-sit, V-sit, etc.

*Principles I live by:*

* Calorie in, calorie out.
   * What goes in my body has to come out someway, somehow.
   * If I'm trying to lose weight but I'm not, I'm either eating too much, working out too little, or both.
* Moderation is key.
   * I started exercising because I needed moderation.
   * There was no way I could've made any progress if I didn't fix my eating habits.
* Hit my daily protein intake as much as I can.
   * I grew the most when I ate the most.
   * It's really tough, shakes make up almost 50% of my daily protein intake.
* Try my very best not to stuff my face with too many carbs.
   * Carbs are devilishly tempting and dangerous, I check myself before I wreck myself.
   * I want to work out as little as possible and not regress.
* Use my ego as a strength, not a weakness.
   * I spent less time caring about why I could only do 7 reps today when I did 8 my last workout.
   * Focus on form, less on numbers.
   * I've wasted way too much time wondering and getting upset about why I can't progress another 2.5lbs. I would've burned more calories laughing at a video of my bad form, than exercising with it.
* Focus, purpose, form, and control.
   * I'm focusing on what I do at the gym, how I rest, and how I'm exercising unless I'm trying to learn from someone else through conversation or observation.
   * My purpose in going to the gym is to get good exercise and to push boundaries.
   * I developed my strength, knowledge, and awareness when I improved my mind to muscle connection to have better control of my body, this lead to an increase in strength.
   * I've seen myself with bad form and it's pretty repulsive.
   * I wasted a lot of time (months) on an exercise with no improvement because I wasn't doing it correctly.
   * Slowing down, taking my time to move the weight through the exercise properly gives my brain time to focus, visualize and engage the muscles correctly.
   * Slamming weights isn't completing the full exercise to me, my goal is to let is rest as gently as possible. There is no reason for me to slam it unless I'll hurt myself if I don't, it's nice to follow through the entire motion and be in control at all times.
* The day I don't feel like exercising, is the day I must exercise.
   * These days come frequently. I'll haul my ass to the gym, and spend at least 10-15 mins on light exercise, work on less fatigued muscles, stretch, figure out what's wrong with my form, or why I'm not hitting my goals at the gym.
   * I listen to my body, if I feel like I'm going to injure myself, I skip out altogether.

*My Inspirations:*

Gym stuff:

* Anyone that I’ve spoken to about fitness, most of what I do and know today is based on our conversations.
* The usuals I see at my gym. I learned so much from our conversations, exchanging tips, and your guidance.
* Others at the gym. We’ve never communicated before, but I’ve seen your focus, form, and types of workouts. I’ve tried most of them, incorporated and modified some.
* ATHLEAN-X: When Jeff says ANYTHING, I damn well listen. I go to him to learn about isolating muscle groups, form, understanding why certain exercises are good or bad, how to exercise, what to exercise, what not to do. If I have a question about a muscle group or exercise, I look to him first. Also, Jesse and face pulls.

Calisthenics:

* OFFICIALTHENX: Chris inspired me to get back into calisthenics, Osvaldo inspired me to take it seriously, I love the way Stefan explains, Zay, Paz, and John are beasts. Very cool dudes doing very cool things.
* Artem Morozov: Artem is ridiculously strong, incredible and inspiring guy.

I also follow SaturnoMovement, Tom Merrick, Calisthenicmovement and others. There are tons of great resources out there.

**OVERVIEW**

Hey all, like many others I've lurked on this sub for a while and found these progress posts very motivating, so here I finally am with mine. Up until 2019 I had never trained properly or learned about nutrition - I had goofed around in the gym a little bit but without any notable progress.

I started in January 2019, weighing 187 lbs, by doing calisthenics / bodyweight training along with keto and 16/8 intermittent fasting (as well as logging calories). I gained a bit of strength and achieved some calisthenics skills, but I ended up completely neglecting lower body strength during this time, which has still been a weak-point since. In terms of physique, I really just wanted to see a six-pack on myself for the first time -- I achieved this, weighing 170 lbs at the end, but retrospectively ended up looking very skinny.

Then in May 2019 I started my bulk and finally started lifting properly. I ran the [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), which I've seen great results on. During the summer, for a month or so, I was also biking 10 miles home from work every day.

I continued my bulk through the end of 2019 and ate big the whole time (that hasn't ever been an issue for me). I switched my routine to [nSuns LP 5-day](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/) in October 2019 because I was bored and stalling on the PPL. At the end of the year I was weighing 205+ lbs and feeling a bit too fluffy.

Finally, I started my current cut in January 2020 and have gotten down to 193 lbs so far, with a general goal of getting to 180 lbs by May (not sure if that's still happening). This time I've simply been counting calories and loosely intermittent fasting (just skipping breakfast), with a little more of an IIFYM approach. I was still running nSuns and enjoying it, but my progress slowed down (starting with OHP) during the cut and recently I had been having some trouble recovering (definitely wasn't sleeping well enough either).

Currently it looks like I'll be taking a break from lifting because I, like many of you, no longer have access to a gym (due to coronavirus) -- so I'll try to maintain by doing some calisthenics in the meantime. Who knows, maybe I'll even get some conditioning in by starting to jog regularly for the first time!

**ROUTINES**

**Calisthenics Upper-Lower Split (January-May 2019):**

Upper (Monday/Wednesday/Friday):

* Skill progressions: L-sit, back lever.
* Pushup variation 3x6-12, pick one of: (Decline pushups, wide/diamond grip pushups, archer pushups, clapping pushups, or one-arm pushups).
* Pullup variation 3x6-12: (Wide/close grip pullup/chinup, weighted pullup, L-sit pullup, commando pullup, head bangers, one-arm pullup progression, or muscle-up progression).
* Dip 3x8-15: (One-arm bench dip, explosive bench dip, or front dip)
* Horizontal pulling 3x6-10: (Tuck front lever row)
* Vertical pushing 3x6-10: (Pike pushups)
* Abs: Using Athlean-X six-pack app

Lower (Tuesday/Thursday):

* Skill progression: Handstand.
* Leg exercise 4x5-12: (Archer squats, pistol squat progression, lunge).
* Explosive leg exercise 3x8-15: (Squat jump, jumping lunge).
* Calf exercise 5x15-25: (One-leg calf raise)
* Abs: Using Athlean-X six-pack app

Looking back this wasn't the greatest routine, it was just something I got off Youtube but at least it got me started. During this period of my training I will admit I often skipped the leg days.

**Reddit PPL (May-October 2019):**

At this point I ran [Metallicdpa's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), which many of you are familiar with. Now that I actually started using weights, here were my stats **(5 RM weights, in lbs)**:

Bench Press: 135 -> 200

Deadlift: 135 -> 315

Squat: 115 -> 155

OHP: 75 -> 120

Row: 115 -> 195

At this point I know what you're thinking about, that squat. I want to clarify that I was no longer skipping leg days at this point, but for some reason I kept stalling and failing on my squats (later came to realize I've had horrid form).

**nSuns LP 5-day (October 2019-March 2020):**

Finally I switched to [nSuns](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/), which has been my absolute favorite. I love the volume and heavy sets, although it has definitely been harder to keep up on the cut than during the bulk. Here are the stats **(1 RM weights, in lbs)**:

Bench Press: 235 -> **260**

Deadlift: 365 -> **395**

Squat: 205 -> **225**

OHP: 145 -> **165**

I am happy with the progress I've made on bench, deadlift and OHP but obviously not with the squat. Throughout my training I've been discovering mistakes I'm making in my squat form, but it still doesn't feel dialed in yet -- at this point I might just go ahead and get help from a trainer, because this is seriously impeding my progress and frankly kind of embarrassing.

As for my nSuns accessory exercises, I've made some changes over time but most recently I was doing these:

Day 1:

* 3x8-12 pullups
* 3x8-12 incline dumbbell bench press
* 3x8-12 iso-lateral row machine
* 3x8-12 incline dumbbell curl SS 3x8-12 reverse dumbell curl
* 3x8-12 cable tricep extension

**DIET**

During the first cut phase, I was doing keto which I found to be effective for quickly losing weight, but it felt overly restrictive and I don't think I could train while doing keto anymore. I was also doing 16/8 intermittent fasting which made it easier to eat less. Finally, I was also counting calories and macros with Lose It! My protein goal was to get about 1 g/lbs, while cutting at a rate of about 2 lbs / week (don't remember the calorie count).

When I started the bulk I was initially still counting calories but soon stopped and just focused on eating big and frankly indulging myself. During this period I wasn't weighing myself either, it was all free rein, but because of all this my bulk may have gotten a little dirty.

Now in my current cutting phase I'm counting calories again and aiming for about 2100 calories, for a weight loss rate of about 1.5 lbs / week. This time around I haven't really been tracking macros or protein, for better or worse, but haven't had any issues yet. The reason for this is because during my first cut phase I was cooking for myself which made it easier to track, whereas I've been eating dining hall food since then.

**SUPPLEMENTS**

I've been supplementing with protein (whey and/or casein) throughout this period, although not as consistently in the past few months. I started supplementing creatine at the beginning of the summer although I honestly can't tell if it makes a difference. Since the start of my cut this Spring I've been drinking Amino Energy (contains EAAs and caffeine) before my fasted workouts. And no, I do not use any steroids.",2020-03-17 15:52:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/fk7jvp/my_1_year_transformation_calisthenics_reddit_ppl/

--

Finally came to the realization that I have become fat and lazy and decided why not perform an interesting scientific experiment (unfortunately with n=1) while I work to remedy one of those ailments.

&nbsp;

My plan is to examine the differences in body composition changes through the same workout routine but at differing caloric deficits with relatively same diet makeup.  I have completed the first four weeks of my experiment while under at least a 1500 kCal deficit (came out to 1637 averaged over the month).  I plan to in the following month decrease to only a 1000 kCal deficit while maintaining same routine and level of intensity and then compare the results.  After that I will continue to slightly decrease the level of deficit for future months and provide the resulting changes in my fat/lean mass ratio as well as a few other metrics like V02 max/RMR.

&nbsp;

Results

Here is the first round of results from 4 weeks of ~1500 caloric deficit.

[Regional Changes](https://i.imgur.com/cJHMNvc.png)

[Individual Part](https://i.imgur.com/vqdL0G3.png)

&nbsp;

Interestingly I saw that my weight change was 95% fat loss and only 5% lean muscle loss which frankly was well above even my most optimistic predictions which I credit partially to my fairly rigorous workout regimen and careful macro planning.

&nbsp;

Diet
--
I utilized the basic form of IF (intermittent fasting).  I would fast each day until after my workout and would then eat about half of my calories for the day which consisted of at least 40g of protein (generally more but this was my minimum macro goal).  Afterwards I would eat my remaining 2-3 meals of the day at least 2 hours apart which would consist of a minimum of 20g of protein.  (Never had any protein shakes as I love eating too much.)

&nbsp;

This would mean that I would fast for around 18 hours a day eating my meals within the remaining 6 hour period and I would always enter a workout in my fasted state (mainly due to convenience but I found this to be an excellent psychological motivator for wanting to do my workout as soon as I was free so I could eat.)

Supplements: Additionally I ingest about 200 mg of caffeine through beverages and take daily 5000 IU D3.  I also take a multivitamin because I enjoy having expensive urine.

&nbsp;

Workout Routine
--
Technically I have a full 7 day routine but I only lift for 6 of the 7 days.  Although I do at least 20 minutes of cardio on the treadmill at the start of every workout.  With an additional final 10 minutes of cardio on my back/bicep days.

&nbsp;

Thursday: Chest + Triceps #1

Friday: Back + Biceps #1

Saturday: Legs + Shoulders #1

Sunday: Cardio

Monday: Chest + Triceps #2

Tuesday: Back + Biceps #2

Wednesday: Legs + Shoulders #2

&nbsp;

Here are the exact lifts/numbers for each week, I've focused on relatively low weight but high volume trying to maintain slow controlled movement.  You can ignore the funny symbols after some of them they were a personal note for how the set felt that I used to decide if I should increase/decrease weight for next workout.

&nbsp;

Going Forward
--
Again I plan to for the following 4 weeks decrease my deficit to roughly 1000 kCal/day and then take additional tests at that end of that month to see how it influences change in fat and lean mass.  Any feedback or ideas on how to improve my experiment or current performance would be awesome. (form/workout tips always appreciated as I'm fairly inexperienced relying mainly on book knowledge/papers).

eun0f7,Fitness,Losing weight slower than before,"Hey everyone,   


I put myself on my first diet at age 28 and was able to lose 2+ lbs every week consistently and without much effort. I weighed around 200 and dropped to 182 in a few months with no exercise and a diet that was low on calories, but not exactly healthy. I incorporated 16-8 intermittent fasting but nothing else. No exercise, nothing. I still drank sodas, didn't focus on nutrition, I just kept calories low and intermittent fasted. Not a good, healthy diet, but it helped me lose weight.  


Not surprisingly, after losing the weight I took it for granted and gained it back slowly. As I turned 30 I was back to around 200 lbs. Before the new year of 2020 I finally pushed myself to diet again but this time much better educated and with a permanent plan that included a more healthy diet, regular exercise, strength training and endurance training, tracking my nutrition, drinking more water, visiting the doctor, removing all unhealthy food like sodas, sugars, etc.  


It's only been a month but I've got to say I am really proud of how well I have implemented these changes. I did not grow up in a healthy environment so this type of lifestyle isn't natural for me.  I am running miles again like I haven't since college, I am eating better than ever, my strength is returning fast, and my energy is back to levels it hasn't been for a long time. My body is thanking me in more ways than one. Friends and family who don't know what I am doing have also commented that I look better/thinner, etc.  


The only thing that is a bit disappointing is that I plan to be at my goal weight (168 lbs) by the end of April by losing an average of 2 lbs a week, but I haven't hit that weekly goal a single time even though I did before on my other diet that was not nearly as healthy.  


At first I thought it was simply from the lactic acid build up that I had the first week or two because of hitting the weights for the first time in years, but the soreness is long gone and on weigh in day this morning I only lost 1 lb, the least amount of weight I have lost so far. My body fat percentage also apparently went up, but I don't really believe the measuring device I am using. It's not very consistent.  


Is the lack of weight loss all due to the fact that I am preventing muscle loss through exercise and perhaps putting a little muscle on? Am I going too extreme? (I really don't think I am. I do not feel like I am pushing myself out of my comfort zone, but rather doing something I should have been doing all my life.) Is my metabolism messed up? Or is everything going fine and I should just be happy with around 1 lb per week? I am wondering if I should back off a little, keep going as is, or perhaps step things up a notch to hit my goals.  


Would love some input from r/fitness. Thanks!

elcx0n,Fitness,Anabolic Fasting,"I have a friend that swears by anabolic fasting, but I am very curious/skeptical of the science behind the idea.

To my limited knowledge about this, the main idea is to burn fat, become leaner, and also maintain or gain muscle all at the same time.

Can your body be in an anabolic and catabolic state at the same time? Is anabolic fasting scientifically proven to work or just another marketing scheme? I'd appreciate any references and studies as well.

&#x200B;

Edit: For those confused about the title or where my friend got this from, it's a combination of intermittent fasting and the anabolic diet. Cory Gregory came up with the idea and promotes it to his followers. He talks about it at the 37 min mark in this video.

Soo here's my story about how my life changed :). 6 years ago i was blessed with the birth of my youngest daughter and shortly after her birth i was cursed with a dislocated knee and MCL issue. I was a long distance runner averaging roughly about 90-100 miles a week. Since i was healing and spending time bonding with my daughter I kept eating like i was still running and not. Be hold 5 years later I went from 160lbs to 234lbs... I guess we can call that a dirty bulk? Either way june of this year my dad went in for heart surgery and I told myself enough is enough. Running didn't sound fun but a buddy of mine is a first responded and avid Cross-fitter. We chatted a lot about the benefits of strength training and it appealed to me. Since i'm not in my 20's any more and i like the time spent with my kids 1-1.5 hours at the gym seemed way more acceptable (plus there's a drop area for them) any ways it's not the crazy transformations you see within 6 months but i'm proud and I can still knock down a sub 20 minute 5k ;).

Here's the information on what i've done plus pictures.

Diet: I don't really count or look at my macro's. what' i've done is portion less and do a Paleo diet with intermittent fasting.

Workout: I'm on a 4 day split routine. I go to the gym 7 days a week but every 5th day is mobility workouts and 40 minutes of cardio. I don't know what my body fat % is as I'm not really trying to shred just lift and have fun. I'll probably try to shred in February or march once all the new years resolutions have melted away from the gym.

du4oyp,Fitness,Excess Skin: How slow should I lose weight? 200lb-130ish goal.,"I've went through the wiki, searched for some tips/answers on the sub and google doesn't seem to have the answers I'm looking for either so maybe someone can link me something I might have looked over.

I've always been over weight with a big belly since I was a little girl, my highest weight was 260 for about a year in maybe 2015. I lost the 60lbs over the course of a year or two and am now sitting at 196lbs (gained some weight last year due to depression/tragic events).

So I finally found the motivation, diet and exercise plan that works for me and I'm losing up to 2lbs a week (results are in inches and I'm certain it isn't just water weight) I know that, across the board, 1-2lbs/week is the recommended weight loss and I've seen plenty of people lose way more weight faster than the rate I'm going. However, my goal is to lose as healthily and steadily as possible. I'm trying to avoid too much excess skin and generally doing more harm than good.

I'm 5'2"" and my goal is to get down to around 130lbs, it looks like it won't take that long at the rate I'm going but I'm worried that, while I achieve my goal in under a year, I'll have not given my skin enough time to ""adapt"" and all the other concerns with losing weight too quickly.

The majority of my work out is bodybuilding/strength training with 15 minutes of light cardio (incline walking) 6 days a week. My natural diet has always been intermittent fasting, I usually only eat a couple of meals between 12 and 6pm.

I'll give myself a ""maintenance period"" for a couple of weeks where I focus more on maintaining weight as well. I slather on lotion, drink lots of water, and I'm pretty sure my genetics are pretty good as my mom who is nearly 50 just now started to look like she's in her late 30's.

Long post short, I see a lot of ""Lose the weight slowly"" advice but... *how* slow? Is 2lbs/week too fast or am I on the right track?

Although I count calories and use supplements to make sure I'm getting sufficient protein, a lot of my diet consists of fast food and prepackaged meat/meals. Because of my size, I'm gradually losing weight despite eating 3500 calories per day. My exercise is about 80% intense weight training and 20% mild cardio.

I started student teaching full time, so I've had a radical change in my schedule.

However, I've found that after I get out of school at 3:00, I'm starving, and the only real option is fast food, unless I want to make an hour and a half round trip back home to make a meal.

This post is going to be VERY detailed as I'm really searching for some aid here, my sleep is crap and I feel like I'm tanking on a daily basis.  


I practice intermittent fasting and tend to consume about 2200 calories on average per day.   


I workout 6 times a week with a routine that follows these principles: 

* Total of 8 exercises each day in the gym
* Each exercise is done 3 tiered reps what I refer to as pyramid down to mild/full exhaustion (10, 8, 8) with a total of 4 sets for each exercise. 
* I do two exercises at a time with a 2 minute break in between a group of 4 
   * This means I would do bicep curls pyramid three (12,10,8) to lat pulldown pyramid three (8, 6, 6) then back to bicep, back to lat and THEN break for two minutes, in which I repeat the bicep,lat,bicep,lat and move onto something else. 
* I  do 3 days on, one off then repeat. 
* I do a back and bicep day, chest/shoulder/tri, and then leg stomach, so I ideally hit most body parts twice a week. 

I recently started a new job which requires me to be on my feet for about 6 hours in a day (building and moving stuff), this is contrasted from being sedentary outside of the gym prior as a student. My main mode of transportation was and is biking or walking and my gym was about a 20 min bike ride to and from the gym so I was getting decent cardio on most days. 

In terms of food I would eat about 125-135 protein, 300-350 carbs and about 50 - 60 fat on average. The food I eat regularly would usually be rice, buckwheat, oats, sourdough bread, sprouted bread, avocado, bulk ground chicken, turkey legs and thighs, fish (smoked, canned, frozen), some frozen vegs (mostly cheap mixed bean greens, spinach and mushrooms), jarred olives, fairlife whole milk to go with the oats, almond milk, cream cheese, nut butter, powdered peanut butter.   
This list sounds varied but I'm eating two meals a day and to get all those calories in I'd rather not be scarfing down broccoli, chicken breast and rice every meal. 

I've always felt a little gassed regularly when I go to the gym, I chalked this up to not really eating enough so I tried to increase calories a few times only to feel lethargic if I increase carbs past 350, I tried increasing protein which lead to constipation and mad gas, I tried fast and started feeling weird pain around my body so I cut back (high carb, high fat don't mix which really isn't a shocker to me) but regardless of what I did I never felt like I had ""more"" or sustained energy daily or in the gym. 

Currently I supplement 3 things: **Glycine in powdered form 5g daily, vitamin k2 mk7 100mg daily and kelp 600mg every other day.** 

An unrelated note  is that I've frequently had an issue with being awake at night, often times I'll get up about 4 - 5 hours after I've fallen asleep, head to the washroom then come back and lie in my bed for 30 minutes before falling back to sleep, I believe it's something psychological keeping me up or even just sending me to the washroom in the first place but regardless it's annoying and I'd like some help on how to stop it, I don't drink liquids before I sleep and I make sure to hit the old dunghole before I sleep so I'm at a loss. 

If anyone has any insight as to what I should be doing, whether its increasing food/changing my food, sleeping more or otherwise I'd be happy to take your info and try something new. Thank you!

# Story (you can obviously skip if not interested):

I used to lift for like two years back in 2014, with severe fuckarounditis and zero diet or progressive overload knowledge, which resulted in almost no gains. Looking back, I am amazed that I did something three times a week without much results so religiously.

I decided to get back into lifting last August. I paid for a coach because I was not sure about my form. This was the best decision so far, because I was doing more than half of the lifts completely, and I mean *completely* wrong. He showed me the correct form for squats (I used to squat with lifted heels, sigh), deadlift, bench press (I did not retract scapulae) and all the isolation exercises.

For the first month or two, he was showing me correct form and how to exercise and I did not really run a specific program. Then I run program my coach gave to me, the cube. I saw some [decent](https://i.imgur.com/DlqniTl.jpg) progress in just this short time, as I was, for the first time in my life, actually activating hte correct muscles during exercises.

From the start, I did calculate my TDEE, but overshot the calories ""just to be sure"". Plus, my local tracking app (something like MyFitnessPal) has a default ""-10% for the thermic effect of food, which is already calculated within TDEE calculators, so on top of my surplus I was eating 10% more... This has resulted in my daily intake of about 4000 calories for my starting weight of 78 kg/172lbs - which combined with lack of progressive overload has resulted in me getting quite heavy on bodyfat - measured at [19% by a DEXA scan.](https://i.imgur.com/pCaGv5j.jpg)

This has resulted in me being in-need-of-a-cut-right-fookin-now. I decided to cut at the moment my belly was showing through my sweaters (I am a belly/lower back/ass fat storer) and people kept pointing that out.

I cut too rapidly and too quickly and also became sick for almost three weeks in the second week of my cut (it's very possible there were connections between my deficit and my illness). Despite that, I did lose some weight. That is because I was sick, therefore not exercising, but still being in a deficit (I had bowel infection - in other words, I shat everything I ate right out). This has probably led to a lot of lean muscle loss as well as strength. Despite that, I saw some [decent fat decrease](https://i.imgur.com/gVy4UoD.jpg) as well (please do not make fun of my EU46/US13 legs).

After a few more weeks of cutting, I was reaping all the perks of [seeing my abs for the first time](https://i.imgur.com/IdjmHPo.jpg) (and I was nowhere near shredded). Despite being skinny, I was always storing enough fat in my midsection that I never actually saw my abdominals. I felt quite happy about my ab veins and biceps veins along with the showing abs, but the long deficit was taking a toll on me. In the last few weeks of cutting, I only lost about 0,5% bodyfat according to my DEXA scan and based on articles I read, my body was saying ""stop cutting"". I was estimated at [13,5% bodyfat](https://i.imgur.com/I0Z42F1.jpg) which was close enough to my goal (I wanted to get below 13) so I decided to stop this torture. Despite eating not as low as at the start of my cut, I was having intense cravings, drank liters of diet soda daily and lost so much sex drive that I did not have any sort of sexual activity (despite having a girlfriend) for almost a month.

I learned from before and adopted a reverse dieting style to not regain all my fat back. This meant slowly increasing calories to find my maintenance, stay there for a bit (it was summer, so I did not intend on tracking religiously and exercising 4 times a week anyway) and see where it leads me. I have to admit I did gain some fat in this period (too many holiday nights and too much careless alcohol and food consumption), though my abs were still semi-visible after the end.

Since the start of August, I decided to bulk again at 3000 calories and [this](https://i.imgur.com/yesviOB.jpg) is where I am now. Since next week, I want to try out reddit PPLPPL split to see where it leads me - I feel like I am stalling on my progress and will probably increase calories by like 150 or so. Luckily though, I will never have to cut from such a ""high"" bodyfat again, so I hope to have more steady progress and shorter cuts in the future.

# Routine:

For the first month or two, I did not run a program and just learned the exercises.

**The Cube**

For 4 months, I run a program called ""[Cube](https://www.powerliftingtowin.com/the-cube-method/)"". It is too long and complicated to list here (it does change every single training) but it is a 4-day program, in which each compound is either run as high-rep, low-rep (power) or explosive. It works with 1RM% and looking back, it was probably way too intermediate for my coach to program this. I still did not apply progressive overload consistently, did not log my training and just tried to lift as much as I could.

**PHUL**

For the cutting and up until now (about 6 months), I run [PHUL](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout) (Upper/Lower 4-day split).

This has been a better training as far as I can tell than Cube, but it still has some things I am not happy with.

# Diet:

**Summary:**

My first bulk was about 4000 calories, my cut was 2100, 2400, 2500, then reverse dieting (slowly increasing by approx 100 cals a week) to maintenance at around 2700 for a month and a half (holidays etc.), then slowly increasing to lean bulk at 3000.

When cutting, i did IF (intermittent fasting). I only ate from 13 PM to 21 PM. This has helped me feel less hungry, but according to research, it has no added fat loss benefits. I will most likely not do this on my next cut, but who knows. I just never stopped feeling hungry in the last hours of my fast anyway.

I track everything every day in my app, I cook my own meals every day (with exceptions like restaurant visits, holidays etc.)

**What I am eating:**

From august to february, my diet consisted of large amounts of oats, chicken, rice, pasta, bars and protein powder.

Then, as I was cutting, my diet switched to more veggies, less calorie dense foods - quinoa, spinach, lean meats, lean fish, oil-free cooking, diet soda (not proud of that one).

Since May, I decided to go vegan, so I am mostly eating beans, lentils, tofu, seitan, tempeh, veggies, rice, quinoa, oats, peanut butter, nuts, fruits.

I cook everyday, so I have plenty of cooking skills that I acquired thanks to my fitness journey. If anyone wants me to share recipes which mostly average 35-45g of protein and 600-800 kcal per portion (they're vegan though), I will happily do so.

**Macros:**

I used a 2g protein for each kg of bodyweight for both cutting and bulking, just to be safe.  Then I had 25-30% of my intake in fats and the rest filled with carbs.

Now, I am steadily slowly bulking on 3000 calories daily with 160g of protein and 110g of fat (rest carbs).

**Supplements:**

I use daily protein powder, creatine, omega-3, b12 and calcium+magnesium.

# Numbers:

Now this is where most of you will probably be surprised - my numbers are not that good compared to other progress posts. I never cared about how much I can lift, but I understand the correlation between how much you can lift and how much muscle you have, so while trying to lift more each session, I do not have impressive numbers. I also never tested 1RM and all these numbers are my 4 sets of 5 repetitions. This is **not** an excuse, but as apparent from my pictures, I have very long humerus and very long femurs, compared to a short torso. This puts me in an advantageous position for the deadlift, but disadvantageous for the squat and bench press. Maybe it contributes to my numbers not being where others have them; but then again, do not compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday.

These are 4x5 with no reps left in the tank.

||Before|Now|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**DL**|50kg/110lbs|110kg/242lbs|
|**Squat**|35kg/77lbs|85kg/187lbs|
|**Bench**|30kg/66lbs|64kg/141lbs|

**Mistakes:**

* I started with too high of a surplus and that resulted in me getting too fat. Looking back, even 500 surplus seems way too high to me. I'd try to go for 300-400 instead.
* I did not apply progressive overload correctly - I only started with a training log months into my training. People, get a training log. Seriously. A spreadsheet on google docs worked best for me.
* I put too much emphasis on isolation exercises instead of compound exercises - progressing on isolations is not nearly as important and progressing on compounds. Besides, it is very hard to progress on isolation exercises as much as on compounds.
* Once I discovered progressive overload, I tried to overload too quickly on too many exercises. Adding 2 reps for every single exercise every single training has led probably to my stagnation with my numbers. Remember, increase only if form remains the same. If you sacrifice form, it is not progressive overload, but quite the opposite.
* I abused failure. Maybe this works for some people, but I went to failure every single training and it has probably taken a toll on both my form and my recovery.
* I had too much of a deficit when cutting & did not diet slowly. I changed from close to 4000 calories to 2100 in a single day. Probably I lost too much of muscle mass due to this drastic change. I basically did the cutting process in reverse - when I saw I was loosing too quickly and too much muscle mass, I had to basically up my calories. Instead of slowly decreasing, I slowly increased and this has led, again, to stagnation.
* I took everything too seriously. It is okay to miss a training due to a party once in a while. It is also okay to not reach your calorie goal or have 300 calories too much. What matters is consistency. Your muscles do not disintegrate the moment you feel hunger or your body does not store fat the moment you eat a big, fat meal.
* The body does not work on an hourly basis. If you get 1000 kcal over your goal due to a night out (or even more, assuming one stops tracking the shots after a certain amount), just eat 500 less each next day. Vice versa if you under-eat.
* Intuitive eating just does not work for me. I have to track - not at all times and at all costs, but without calorie tracking, I think that most people will have sub-par progress. I like to go all in on things and thus, I think tracking your diet is very important. Obviously we all have preferences and my priority was progress over convenience.
* Listen to your body. I had countless little pains, illnesses and always trained through them. This has more than twice led to some strained muscle (mostly trapezius or lower back), aches in my joints or wrist... if something hurts, **stop doing it**. If you feel sick, do not go and go when you feel like it. I am quite lucky honestly to not have injured myself worse in some cases.
* Cutting: my best friends were diet soda, pre-workout, veggies and nori chips. Also switching from rice and beef to chicken and quinoa really does make a difference.
* Bulking: peanut butter is your friend and big breakfast really makes it easier to reach your goal.

I hope my post has helped or inspired anybody.",2019-09-05 18:46:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/d04ymj/just_your_regular_1_year_progress_full_of_trial/

cucu5x,Fitness,Cutting while intermittent fasting ??,"Hey,

So today I almost fainted out in the gym.
I woke up extremely tired and out of energy and this might be because I am cutting and Intermittent fasting at the same time. 

Some background : I started intermittent fasting in early June and I’ve got quite used to it. I no longer feel the crave for food and I eat between 12 pm to 8pm.  (16h fast)

However I’ve been going to the gym for about 1 year and I saw some progress but not anything really substantial. So last Monday, I finally decided to get my shit down and learn about macros and calories intake. I also decided to start with cutting since I have a lot of fat to burn down and fixed a 1850 calories per day goal.

But like I said before, this morning (Friday) I woke up extremely dissy and had a small migraine. I wasn’t really feeling sick, just tired. Still went to the gym but during deadlifts I wasn’t feeling really well and started to see stars.

Anyway all that to ask if cutting at 1850 calories and Intermittent fasting at the same time is safe or should I consider other options ?

cpvkb2,Fitness,Question about Caloric Deficits and slow cutting,"I am curious about how much I should be working out and am pretty certain I am misunderstanding this.

(background fluff)

I started working out alongside my dieting (intermittent fasting and high protein) about a month and a half ago. The youtube channel Jeremy Ethier has given me a lot of good information so far and has helped out with learning new workouts and how to better perform workouts. One of his recent videos I have watched is his ""best science-based diet for fat loss"" and at one point he shows a graph describing a caloric deficit as burning more calories than you intake. 

(main question) 

 A caloric deficit is burning more calories than you intake as I understand it. At the moment (using a calorie counter phone app) losing \~1lb a week for me means I need to ingest at max 2.3k calories a day. Does this mean in order to effectively (fast or slow) cut, I need to manage to burn over 2.4k calories in a day? That seems excessive to me and I don't know if I could possibly do that. How does it change things if I am trying to slow cut (to be able to gradually put on muscle mass while I am also cutting the fat off)?

I'm on a bit of a cut and since not eating for long periods of time has always been really easy for me, I decided to give intermittent fasting a try and I'm doing fine, but I'm actually not sure how or why it is benefitting me. I track my macros to make sure I hit protein goals and whatnot, but is there some benefit to exactly the same amount of calories and macros in a small eating window as compared to through-out the day?

cgy1dh,Fitness,Question about working out while intermittent fasting,"Does weight lifting and workout out in general while you are in a fasted state make you lose muscle?

I started intermittent fasting mainly because my day is so much more productive if I skip breakfast in the morning. The science behind it was interesting too but the first part is the main reason why I started doing it.

My only concern is I keep seeing that you could lose muscle if you weight lift in fasted state. I'm usually in the gym by 9:30am and will have my first meal at 2:30pm. As long as I get my macros in with proteins and calories, I should be ok and not lose any muscle right?

cejav9,Fitness,How 6 months changed my body!,"**Tl;dr:** This sub helped me A LOT by improving my overall knowledge and I would recommend anyone that is just starting to read the Wiki as you will learn many things!

# Short Introduction

It's been actually 7 months now since I've been going to the gym, 6 of which I've been counting my calories and having a proper diet. During this period, I only skipped gym twice and those were only leg days. In the first 3 and a half months I followed the Ice Cream Fitness (ICF) routine, which I think is the best thing for a beginner to follow. During the first month I just learned the proper technique for all the compound movements as I started with an empty bar in almost all of them and I didn't count my calories. From the beginning of 2019 I started counting my calories and cutting the fat while increasing my newbie strength, although, as many of you will say that I should have just started bulking I wanted to see some improvement first, and also to begin the bulking phase with a lower body fat percentage. After finishing with ICF and the cutting phase I started bulking and I changed my routine to Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower (PHUL) which I followed until this week when I switched to Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training (PHAT).

Every phase of my transformation will be broadly detailed further.

# Pics & stats

([Progress Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/JOj3lJ3))

*Sex*: Male

*Age*: 23 years old (22 when I started)

*Height*: 180 cm/ 5'11''

*Weight*: (As I weighted myself daily, I'll write the weekly average in order to prevent any confusion)

Before I started cutting: 26/12/2018-01/01/2019 - average is 72.63 kg / 160.1 lbs

Once I finished cutting: 18/03/2019-24/03/2019 - average is 68.03 kg / 149.9 lbs

Where I am now 08/07/2019-14/07/2019 - average is 73,12 kg / 161,2 lbs


# Background
Right now I am doing a Master's Degree in Cyber Security Engineering and before I never played any sport in particular, I only used to play football, but that was in high school, 4 years ago. So, I was basically a couch potato, not including that I played World of Warcraft also :)). Basically, before I started going to the gym I never really cared what I ate meaning that I could stay until 5 pm without eating because I was too lazy to cook anything and then because I was too hungry I would put a lasagna or pizza in the oven. Next, before going to sleep I would eat a few more sandwiches and that would be all for a normal/typical day. 

Almost 2 years ago now I had a similar attempt in which I started going to the gym, but that only lasted for 2 months before I got bored of eating only rice and chicken because that's what I thought I had to eat. Although I didn't stick to it, it was a really good introduction into the fitness lifestyle and nutrition altogether as I learned a lot of things.

Starting last December, I was really motivated, and I had a few goals in my mind, one of them being that I really wanted to be more active and have a healthier lifestyle and another funny one was that I wanted to see my bicep veins. One thing that stood in my mind the whole time was that I will not give up before reaching 3 months into ICF.
*****
# Progress 
**Cutting** 01/01/2019 to 24/03/2019  

As you can see in the initial picture, I was already going to the gym for like 3 weeks and my muscles already got a ""toned"" appearance. From the first day I started counting my calories with the MyFitnessPal application and I kept a diary with my exercises. It was a pretty harsh period as I was cutting and doing intermittent fasting and during the nights when I was really hungry, I would stay at my computer and read or learn new recipes or things about exercises in the gym. One thing that was really helpful and remained within my mind till now was whenever I had any lust for something sweet or unhealthy, I would repeat the following: ""STAY CONSISTENT"", phrase that I learned from Buff Dudes on Youtube!

From the exercise point of view during ICF and cutting period I got my compound movements to the following levels:
(I'm sorry, but I never tried my 1RM in any of the exercises)

Squats: empty bar -> 77.5 kg / 170.8 lbs for 5 reps

Bench Press: 30 kg -> 67.5 kg / 148.8 lbs for 5 reps

Barbell Row: empty bar -> 55 kg / 121.2 lbs for 5 reps

Deadlift: 30 kg -> 100 kg / 220.4 lbs for 5 reps

Overhead Press: empty bar -> 37.5 kg / 82.6 lbs for 5 reps

As you may know in ICF/SS you always increase your weight by 2.5 kg / 5.5 lbs and overall Squats and OHP were the exercises which really made me struggle with progressing.

But overall was a great experience and I got my abs to show and my bicep vein to pop as I always wanted. 

From the nutrition point of view I used intermittent fasting 17-7(17 hours interval without eating, 7 hours interval of eating) and I started with eating around 1900 kcal(45% carbs/ 30% protein/ 25% fat) which I then lowered till 1750 at some point as I wasn't losing any more weight and I was doing High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) around 2 times a week in order to help with the deficit as at some point you should stop lowering your calories and increasing your cardio level. I still drank alcohol like once per month. Once I hit my lowest week of under 68 kg, I was still thinking of lowering my body fat, but that would interfere with my muscle I thought so I stopped and switched to a clean bulk.

**Bulking** 25/03/2019 - present

I think I should start from the beginning with how my strength increase in the last 3 and a half months, but I still didn't try any of my 1RM, so all I have to give you is my 4-5RM:

Squats: 77.5 kg / 170.8 lbs -> 105 kg / 231.4 lbs for 5 reps

Front Squats: 75 kg / 165.3 lbs for 10 reps

Bench Press: 67.5 kg / 148.8 lbs -> 82.5 kg / 181.8 lbs for 5 reps

Deadlift: 100 kg / 220.4 lbs -> 130 kg / 275.5 lbs for 4 reps

Overhead Press: 37.5 kg / 82.6 lbs -> 45 kg / 99.2 lbs for 5 reps (I feel like I'm still lacking strength in this exercise)

Barbell Row: 55 kg / 121.2 lbs -> 80 kg / 176.3 lbs for 5 reps

PHUL is an incredible routine and a great follow up for ICF as you have much more freedom with your number of repetitions/sets. During the bulk I started with around 2500 calories and right now I am eating around 3150 calories daily (55% carbs/25% protein/20% fat). I don't really have cheat meals unless I am on vacation and I don't really have any other choice.

**Overall diet** 

I always try to keep my diet diversified and try new recipes or at least change the spices that I use in certain meals, so I won't get bored. Here's a picture of what I had a few days ago ([Picture](https://imgur.com/a/Mvp0ETt)) and you can see that I usually have only one meal that contains meat and most of the times I eat oats twice a day, but cooked differently as I love it so much and as it is the most micronutrient dense cereal. The whole meal prep for that day took me 35 minutes with washing the dishes afterwards! 
I never surpass 2.5g of protein per kg and I try to keep my fats always in between 50-80g. 

It might be hard sometimes having to cook and preparing so much food, but in the end, you will be thankful for everything that you put into your body.

*Supplements*: I drink a shake containing protein(amount is between 15-25g depending on my macros for the day), glutamine (5g), creatine(5g), BCAA(5g) and I also take multivitamins whenever I feel like I didn't eat enough vegetables and micronutrients overall, fish oil which I take daily and I started to take zinc & magnesium about a week ago before going to bed.
***** 
#Conclusion 

Overall, I feel like this is the best period of my life thanks to how much I changed my lifestyle. Right now I will keep bulking as I just changed my routine to PHAT and I hope to increase my muscle mass and my overall strength. Right now, I am not really sure until when I want to keep bulking, but it will all depend on how I look, but probably I will keep bulking till I get to around 80 kg / 176.3 lbs. But yeah, this was my experience these last 7 months and I hope I motivated some of you to start TODAY, as we only have one life and EVERYDAY counts!

*Further goals*: Get my bench press to 100 kg / 220.4 lbs before 1 year of training and being able to do a single muscle up. (I will need to change my gym for this, as I don't have enough space in my current one in order to even try it.

ccf0ga,Fitness,My 2.5 yeara transformation (M18 74kg to M20 68kg),"First of all, my [progress pics](https://i.imgur.com/7H2FQw5.png).

I'm a 5'7 20 year old student (turning 21 next week) who decided exactly two and a half years ago he'd had enough of constantly going to the gym and only seeing mediocre progress at best. In my before pic, January 2017, I'd been going to the gym for a little over 3 years believe it or not. My gym knowledge consisted pretty much of whatever the other gym bros told me and I just followed a mediocre brosplit (chest/biceps, back/triceps, skip leg day, etc...), eating whatever my mom cooked at home and trying to get some cans of tuna in for some protein.

I decided I'd had enough and with me moving out for college, it was the perfect opportunity to get on the right track in my fitness journey. I started reading a LOT about everything fitness related and got on a decent program. I started tracking my macros, hitting at least 1g of protein per lb bodyweight and got on a 'decent' program. If I remember correctly, I started doing 5x5 compound movements and a bunch of isolation work and I quickly progressed a lot. I made a post here in september 2017 (you can find it in my post history if you want to read more about how I trained back then). It was about this time that I realized I was doing good, but I could do much better.

Those 9 months I'd been pretty much starving myself, eating 1500-1800 calories daily with around 150g of protein (half a kg of chicken every day lol). I got a lot of good feedback on my post and decided to start eating properly (slow bulk and cut cycles). Nowadays I'm slow bulking on 3200 calories. I usually run a slow bulk for around 6 to 8 months then do a heavy cut (about 1000 calories deficit) for a good 2 months.  

I also got on nSuns and pretty much fell in love with the routine; I still run it to this day although slightly modified (I use the rep scheme for my compound movements and then do my own thing for isolation exercises). 

Somewhere along the way I filmed myself and realized I was a major egolifter and deloaded pretty heavily (seriously, technique is everything guys). I can now hit the following weights for 1 to 3 reps with pretty good form:

- Squat: 355 lbs
- Deadlift: 315 lbs
- Bench press: 245 lbs
- OHP: 185 lbs (seated OHP)

For my routine, I run a 6 day PPL making sure to hit every muscle at least twice a week (usually go heavy one day and higher reps the other day). If you care for it, this is my current routine:

Push
- Bench press - nsuns
- Incline dumbbell press 5x8-12
- Pushups 4xAMRAP
- Dumbbell shoulder press 5x12-15

As far as supplements go I take 5g of creatine monohydrate every single day and eat plenty of whey protein (although not necessary, I just use it as a tool to hit my macros). Occasionally take caffeine pills as a preworkout. No, I do not and have never taken any PEDs and I do not care if you don't believe me (I weigh less than 70 kgs, seriously?)

I learned there's no magic recipe or shortcut for fitness. It's all about consistenly hitting your calories/protein goal and progressing your weights with correct form. For the last 2.5 years I've been in the gym an average of 2 hours a day, 6 days a week lifting heavy weights. I hardly do any cardio at all (I hate cardio lmao) as I prefer to just lower my calorie intake if needed.

I use intermittent fasting as a tool to manage my hunger (this is absolutely not needed and just my personal preference). I do NOT eat perfectly everyday. In fact I'm a pretty huge stoner and occasionally eat 5000-6000+ calories every other week or so but I do try to eat less the following days in order to average it out and eat a decent amount of calories weekly.

As for my future goals I think I'd like to compete in bodybuilding some time next year and just keep getting stronger, bigger, and leaner.

c8t66j,Fitness,How do you recover after a day (or three) of eating bad food/skipping gym?,"Holy hell. A couple days ago I tried getting back on intermittent fasting. It was going great until about day three where I ate a shit ton of fast food an hour before going to bed and ended up not sticking to my routine for the next two days. 

This morning I woke up feeling like a garbage can and went to the kitchen where I found twix white chocolate  bars, pre-made sandwiches and more. I ate everything. Side note: am not the one buying all the junk food. The people I live with always like a stocked up kitchen and are more than happy when I help myself. So it’s not a matter of not buying these things but just self-control. 

As of now, two hours after indulging, im sitting down thinking about my shame. Idk why I do this to myself lol.

bze0g8,Fitness,Weight Loss Update: 438 lbs to 260 lbs. ~ 180 pounds down in 1 year naturally with diet and exercise!,"[Before and After Picture (438 lbs to 260 lbs)](https://imgur.com/gallery/KnSMQOW) 

Since a young boy, I have always struggled with being overweight and have had countless failed attempts trying to lose it. On April 3rd of last year, I decided to finally commit and really push myself to the limit and beyond both physically and mentally. I knew this time was different; my mindset and determination to succeed were stronger than ever before. Over this past year, I have learned so much, about weight loss, exercise, dieting, and myself as a person. With the use of IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day), keeping CICO in mind, and a consistent workout routine, I have been able to lose 180+ pounds thus far.


Height: 6’2

Age: 20 years old

Weight Difference in Before and After Picture: 438 lbs to 260 lbs (178 lbs lost)


Exercise:

I have been doing a bodybuilding routine in order to try to maintain and build as much muscle as possible while I am simultaneously losing all the weight I am. So doing a muscle building workout routine has definitely been key for me to help with my physique and not have me looking flat with all the weight I am losing.  Also, I workout (both lifting and cardio) in a fasted state, mainly to help burn fat and build muscle more efficiently. 

Since I started working out in April of last year, I have tried out a variety of routines (Bro Split, 4-Day UL, 6-Day UL, 6-Day PPL, 5-Day ULPPL) and have had success with all of them but find the best and most efficient for my current schedule to be the 5-Day Upper, Lower, Push, Pull, Legs routine. I do this routine while incorporating cardio (usually HIIT) right after I am done lifting on at least 3 of those days typically. I also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball, soccer, boxing, or going for a jog whenever I can.

Here is the current routine I am following:

Day 1 (Upper Day):
Bench Press - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
Barbell Row - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
DB Overhead Press - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Wide-grip Pulldowns or Pull-ups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
DB curls - 4 sets - 8-12 reps
Straight-arm Pulldowns/Face-pulls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps

Day 2 (Lower Day):
Back Squat - 4 sets - 5-8 reps
Deadlift - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Hack Squat - 3 sets - 5-8 reps
Lying Leg Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Single-leg Leg Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Standing Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Core Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps

Day 3: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, go for a jog, etc.)

Day 4 (Pull Day):
Barbell Row - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Wide-grip Pulldowns or Pullups - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
T-bar, Cable or DB Rows - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Close-grip Pulldowns - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Straight-arm Pulldowns/Facepulls - 3 supersets - 10-15 reps each
Barbell Curls - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Hammer Curls, Cable or DB - 3 sets - 8-12 reps

Day 5 (Push Day):
DB Bench Press - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Overhead Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Incline DB Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Cable Crossovers (standing or seated) - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Lateral Raises - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Close-grip Bench Press - 3 sets - 8-12 reps
Tricep Extensions - 3 sets - 8-12 reps

Day 6 (Leg Day):
Back Squat - 4 sets - 6-10 reps
Deadlift - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Leg Press - 3 sets - 6-10 reps
Leg Extensions/Leg Curls - 3 supersets - 8-12 reps
Seated Calf-Raises - 4 sets - 10-15 reps
Core Workout - 4 sets - 10-15 reps

Day 7: REST / Do some form of cardio (Play sports, Go for a jog, etc.)


Diet:

I believe that finding a long-term sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight, but ensuring you keep the weight off! Finding the right plan is a person to person basis so I did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques (IF, OMAD, Keto, Atkins etc.) until I was able to find one that I was pleased by and could see myself doing long-term. Currently, I am doing OMAD/IF on a High Protein, Low Carb diet.

Macros: 

Currently I try to keep it roughly 40-45% protein, 30-35% fats, and 20% carbs. I am not very strict on these percentages but aim to keep within these ranges as much as possible.

Day of eating:

Most days I am doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and I have this meal usually right after I workout (workout is done fasted). A regular day of eating this one meal would be a post-workout protein shake/bar, Chicken usually as my main meat source of protein, or turkey, beef etc. when I can. A salad and veggies as well as often as I can to ensure I get my greens in and a good source of fibre! Then for desert or if I need to get more fibre in I will have a fibre bar, kale chips, granola bar, or protein ice cream, which are all high sources of fibre and taste great! If I am not doing OMAD, I will be doing Intermittent Fasting on usually a 2-4 hour window to eat, where I will have the aforementioned foods except more split up. I am not really a picky eater so this is what my diet mostly consists of.

Supplements:

-Ashwaganda (Pill form, one 650mg pill before workout when I need an extra energy boost)

-Kaizen Whey Isolate Protein (2 scoops @ 35g/scoop post-workout usually)

-ENGN Shred Pre-workout (1 scoop 15-30 minutes before workout) 


Conclusion:

I have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isn’t done yet (roughly 30-50 pounds to lose) I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far. Through this weight loss, not only have I been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health, but I have also found a true purpose and calling for once in my life. I plan to make as big of a positive impact as possible and help/inspire as many people as I can. This is just the beginning and I’m genuinely excited for what I have planned in the future! Thanks for reading, I have love for every single one of you and wish you all the most success on your journeys! :)


EDIT: Just got back from the gym to see all the support you guys left me... and wow... I truly feel so grateful and blessed. To see all the love and support from people I don’t even know, some who are genuinely happy and proud of me... it’s something I will never take for granted. What makes me even more happy and content is how many people who are struggling with the same issues I am/was and were positively impacted by this or got that extra push they needed to keep going... to keep pushing despite all the hardships they may encounter. I just feel so blessed to have this opportunity and seriously have love for all of you. Honestly, it feels amazing to not only be recognized for all the hard work, and literal blood, sweat, and tears that led me to this point, but also be able to inspire and motivate others to work towards a better and healthier version of themselves. I promise this is only the beginning, and I will do the best I can to lead by example and make as much of a positive impact as I possibly can. And for those who were inspired/motivated by my journey and are currently facing adversity, you have to do it yourself, you must realize your potential, that potential which we all possess inside of us, and become the best version of yourself you can be. I know it’s hard and might seem impossible at times, but trust me, it is very much possible, and very much worth it. Once again, thank you all for all of the support, I genuinely appreciate all of the love. Stay blessed, and best of luck on your journeys. 🙏❤️",2019-06-11 15:38:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/bze0g8/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/
byrj6l,Fitness,"M24 5'10"" - 155lbs -> 185 lbs -> 170lbs, a bit over 2.5 years progress","First off, photos...https://imgur.com/a/WmSiO3u

The first pic is from Oct 2016 (22yrs old). I had been to the gym infrequently throughout college but would usually just run 2-3 miles on a treadmill and fuck around with the dumbbells or machines. I drank often and didn't track meals, ate like shit, etc.

After deciding to take working out more seriously - I did cardio (running, HIIT), some light compounds, and used the machines 5/days a week for 6 months. I put on around 10 lbs before I found this sub and started researching ways to improve (2nd pic).

I then went to nSuns 6 day for around 5 months, PHUL, and a few other routines from the wiki. Nsuns brought my lift numbers way up but I eventually burnt out and started accumulating minor injuries. I switched to PHUL and bulked for the next ~1.5 years and reached my heaviest/goal weight of 185lbs, but I still didn't like the way I looked. After that I cut back down to 160, up to 175, down to 160, back to 170. I clearly can't make up my mind/diet self control is not always great.

Currently running J&T 2.0 (~4 days a week) for the second time, I've implemented some cardio a few times a week this time around. I mostly eat intuitively/around maintenance, but I have tried the whole intermittent fasting thing while cutting as a way to help with hunger (not extremely strict, just skipping breakfast). 

Right now I aim for around 3,000 calories and ~0.8g of protein per lb body weight, but don't calculate fat or carb ratios. I increase my intake if I stop gaining (trying for a lean bulk of 0.5lbs/week). When I was cutting my lowest was 2k calories/day at 160. 

My current diet is fairly basic, I eat a lot of prepped meals using a slow cooker: chicken thighs, rice, vegetables, pasta, peanut butter, beans, tuna, mac and cheese, overnight oats, tacos, eggs, etc. I have a bit of a sugar issue lately haha but working on curbing it back. 

Compound lifts on J&T I will usually do warmup sets of 5 reps increasing from 135 until I reach my working set for the day. Percentages usually follow for each lift but as an example for Squat:

5x135, 5x185, 5x205 -> Working set 245 x 5, 225x3, 225x3. 
* I don't set this type of schedule in stone and switch it up based on how I'm feeling that day. Below are my most recent max sets in lbs (I haven't tested 1RM in awhile, but will in a few weeks w/ my program) and a typical week (Sat/Sun sometimes interchanged). 

* Mon: Squat, Rom DL, leg/back accessories

* Tues: HIIT for 1 hour or run

* Wed: Bench, CG Bench, tricep/chest/shoulder accessories (dips, cable flies)

* Thurs: DL, Front Squat, Lat PD, row, bicep curls, leg ext

* Fri: Rest

* Sat: HIIT for 1 hour or run

* Sun: OHP, Incline Bench, shoulders/trip/chest

Starting and Current maxs:

* B: 135 x 5 -> 250 x 2
* S: 95 x 5 -> 255 x 5 (lingering hip flexor issue, this is my weakest lift by far)
* D: 95 x 5 -> 395 x 2
* O: 45 x 5 -> 145 x 3

Overall I'm really satisfied with my progress to date. I would love to get stronger and bump back up to 185 without getting into a dirty bulk, eat everything in sight mindset like my first go at it. I find it very tedious to track calories while bulking so definitely an area I could improve. A huge contributor to my progress was cutting out alcohol almost 9 months ago (shoutout r/stopdrinking), which gives me some room for extra calories from food.

First time posting so if anyone has anyone questions or if I can make the formatting better let me know! Reading this sub was great motivation when I first started out. Thanks!",2019-06-10 01:00:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/byrj6l/m24_510_155lbs_185_lbs_170lbs_a_bit_over_25_years/

bv8ms4,Fitness,Training in the middle of intermittent fasting and muscle loss.,"So, just a quick background, i've done a lot of weight training and bjj between my 20-25, was really fit and strong (had around 100kg and 15% body fat on my peak) (im 1,81m)

Due to work and study, i stopped training for around 5 years, in this period i put a lot of fat, around 20kg (120-125kg).

Last year i started training again to lose weight, so i started doing 18/6 intermittent fasting, It worked wonders, ive gone back to 100kg (probably around 20-25%bf).

At the start of 2019, i got kind of bored of doing weight loss, so i got back to some bulking, and now im sitting around 110kg (got around 8-10kg mass.

Now i want to get lean for the summer at the end of the year.

The thing is, i HAVE to eat at 12:00pm (I eat where i work), and i can only train at 09:00PM.

So i train Right in the middle of  my intermittent fasting (i eat from 12:00PM to 06:00PM), and althou it worked really well when i came back, im scared of losing  mass not eating for such a long time after training.

My question is, if i do the intermittent  fasting again, with heavy weight training, some cardio, along with good protein intake, will i risk losing my mass?

Slightly NSFW fat guy in boxers. 

https://imgur.com/a/ZEiP2db

&nbsp;

In early 2017 I actually was up to 420lbs (sadly I have no pictures from those days, I wasn't ahh very photogenic) and slowly without any real plan I started toward my goals with small steps like cutting out soda and cutting back on junk food and spending a little time getting introduced to the gym.  January 2018 I knuckled down and put a more disciplined routine in to effect.  January to December of 2018 I lost 107 pounds 377 to 270.  Off to a rocky start this year mostly on the diet side, but I've been kind of compensating by still killing it in the gym,  currently I'm at 245 lbs.  Lately as I've been getting lighter I've introduced some of the big compound lifts likes squats and deadlifts and it's been doing wonders I didn't know where possible on my posterior chain and general muscle balance.  Lately between compounding weight loss and muscle gain the difference I've been feeling in my overall physical capabilities has been staggering and of course, immensely motivating. 

Heres a breakdown of my routine. 

&nbsp;

-**Intermittent fasting** 16 hours fasted & 8 hour meal periods.  This has been a huge help in caloric intake management but I've also definitely noticed many other health benefits while I was maintaining I. F.  I had a very good experience using I. F. for a while and would suggest it to anyone looking to lose a lot of weight but I've had a harder time maintaining it in the new year as I've grown fond of morning coffee to help me get started...

&nbsp;

-**Weekly meal prep** with high protein, low carbs veggies and fruits.
https://imgur.com/gallery/5ZldALS
Heres a folder that showcases a lot of the meals I've made.  I worked toward a balance of nutrition but also being able to enjoy the meals so I certainly didn't maintain perfect discipline.  Always included fruit but it didn't always make it in the pictures.  This is the single biggest game changer in my routine, without my meal prep I absolutely never could have made this much progress on my weight. 

&nbsp;

-**Meal replacement shakes** for dinner. 3-5 times a week.  I've been through many brands, currently using Labrada High Protein meal replacement shakes, not the best flavor or nutrition, but balanced with price point I've found it pass-able.  Been trying to rely on these less as proper whole foods are priority but I've still found it to be a reliable crutch.

&nbsp;

-I use C4 Preworkout and Gold standard 100% whey Isolate for post workout shakes, sometimes with some fruits and stuff blended. 

&nbsp;

-5x days at the gym weekly. Usually the weekly routine is. 

Sunday: Cardio

Monday: Lower Body 

Tuesday:  Upper Body

Wednesday: Rest

Thursday: Lower Body

Friday: Upper Body

Saturday: Rest

&nbsp;

I'm not the type to catalogue workout routines or keep tabs on numbers. This means I can't accurately quantify my overall gains when it comes to muscle progress or cardiovascular health. That being said I will just kind of go through where I'm at right now with my workout routine and numbers to give you an idea.    
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Cardio Day:**
A lot of times I just go in stretch and hit the elliptical hard for an hour (heres my personal record on the elliptical atm https://imgur.com/a/x2S5QZz 
Lately I've been mixing it up using different machines mostly arc and treadmill and starting with some step burpies and high steps etc.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Lower Body Day:**
15 Minutes HIIT on ARC to warm up. 

**Squats** (Recently added this month, Smith machine, no squat rack, assuming Smith bar is 20lbs.) 
5x5 Working sets are 240 lbs, first set is 120 for warmup. 

**Leg Press** 5x10 (Dunno sled weight something like 80-100 lbs? Just including 45lbs plate count here) 
5x10 10x Plate Warmup 16x plate working sets, drop weight on last set if necessary. 
I do 5x step burpees in between each set here to try and keep heart rate up.

4x10 Superset

**Calf Extension Machine** 350lbs after warm-up set

**Leg Curl Machine** 100lbs

**Deadlifts** (Another new lift, chose leg day as upper body time table is pushing it.)
5x5 110lbs Warmup,  160lbs working sets, usually fail fifth set.  Got a lot of work to do here.. 

Thats about it, after the dead lifts I do a little core work like planks or leg lifts 3x10 and then spend some time on a full body stretching routine on the true stretch.  On my weekends(monday tuesday) if I'm feeling it I'll spend 30 minutes minutes on the elliptical after the workout as well.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Upper Body Day:**

15 Minutes HIIT on ARC to warm up. 

3x10 Superset

**Flat DB Bench Press** 60lbs

**Standing alternating DB Curls** 40lbs

**Standing DB Shrugs** 60 lbs

Usually sneak a lil super set of 3x5 Step Burpees and high knees here to keep heart rate up

3x10 Superset

**Under Hand assisted pull-ups** 55lbs of counter weight. 

**Assisted Dips** 10lbs counter weight(Recently become strong/light enough to do this w/o assistance but I find my legs swing all over the place..) 

**Ab Machine** 130lbs (the one with verticle handles ahead of you that you push forward with stiff arms as you lean forward.) 

Sneak in another single set of step burpies on the way to next super set. 

3x10 Superset 

**Rope pull downs** 60lbs

**Standing Barbell curl** 60lbs (max barbell weight at gym)

**Standing shoulder press** 60lbs

3x10 Superset

**Smith shrugs** 160lbs (my traps have been a bit neglected trying to change that) 

**Standing side lateral raises** 15 lbs (New lift, shoulders have been neglected) 

**Front plate raise** 25lbs (another new lift) 

Also considering barbell rows or maybe another back excercise?

Otherwise thats about it, I hit up a few more sets of step burpees then go to the true stretch for my stretching routine and if I'm feelin it on my weekends I'll do a recovery pace jog on the elliptical.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Every day:**  
School yard stretch routine & 5~10 minute jump rope session.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#**Closing:**

Right now my top priorities are weight loss, correcting muscle imbalances, gaining mobility & building muscle.  My routines tend to stay static too long as I'm a creature of habit so I've tried to develop a kind of all encompassing routine but I know how much my inflexibility is holding me back and I've been working on getting out of my comfort zone lately.

bjllu3,Fitness,Regarding Intermittent Fasting and Losing Weight,"Hello r/Fitness!

&#x200B;

I've been running an Intermittent Fasting diet for the past two and a half months (used to do 20/4, but doing 18/6 now), and it's allowed me to go from 210bs to 190lbs from when I started, but I feel that I've been plateauing lately.

&#x200B;

For the past few weeks I've been floating around 188-190, and I'd really like to get down to 180 by the end of the month, if not that, at least 185.

&#x200B;

My primary goal with losing weight is to reduce body fat, while maintaining muscle mass. I'm not too concerned about gaining muscle mass at the moment, although if I could lose fat AND gain muscle that'd be the best scenario for me.

&#x200B;

I'm currently taking in about 1800 calories, and my macro spread is 35% carbs, 40% protein, 25% fat.

&#x200B;

I lift 5 times a week (Mon-Tues, Thurs-Sat), with one day being my ""active resting"" day (Wed) where I do 20 min of cardio and 10 min of core, and the other day being my ""full resting"" day (Sun).

&#x200B;

I have a few specific questions:

&#x200B;

1. Will I continue losing weight if I workout this much and take in about 1800 calories a day, or do I need to reduce my calorie intake?
2. Is my macro spread influencing my ability to lose fat while maintaining muscle mass?
3. I'm still doing Intermittent Fasting, but I tend to have coffee creamer in my coffee in the morning. I also have a half serving of BCAAs that I drink passively at work. I know these break my fast, but I assume that since I'm staying within my calorie limit, I'll still lose weight. Is this true, or am I screwing up my ability to lose weight/fat by breaking my fast like this?

If you'd like me to provide additional info to better answer my questions, let me know.

**EDIT**: What the fuck I didn't expect so many people to respond to this LOL.

Since I originally forgot to put this in my OP, I'll put my personal stats here now:

&#x200B;

Age: 25

Height: 5'9""

Sex: Male

&#x200B;

After reading the comments, I've narrowed down the likely cause of my problem to ""I cheat my diet on some days so that may be fucking up my progress"". I also have a bad habit with changing up my diet a bit every week or so because I want to experiment with new macro distributions, food types, etc. I really don't stay as consistent as I make it sound.

Like I'll stay consistent with the food I eat and exactly how many calories I eat for about a week at most, but I always fuck it up somehow by the 5th to 8th day cuz I just really want a Chocolate Cake Shake at Portillos or something LOL.

I think the reason why I was able to make progress in the last 2-3 months is because I ate at *roughlly* 1700-1800 calories every day, even though I still cheated on some weekends. I really wasn't staying that committed to a strict regimen or anything. I just guesstimated a lot of the time.

I also went on a 2400 calorie diet last week or so cuz I just wanted to see if I could still lose weight at that many calories, but I wasn't so I moved back to 1800 calories about half a week ago.

bj42tp,Fitness,Feeling drained all day after morning run.,"I've recently began running in the mornings, around 3km, nothing to brag about. On top of this I then walk around 5km to work and then 5km home after work. 
I've been doing intermittent fasting (16:8) for around a year along with the walking to and from work 5 days a week. I have my first meal at 1pm and eat through till 9.
Now that I've added the running to my routine, I feel dead before lunch time, perk up a bit after lunch and then again when I get home until my dinner. When I say dead I mean like really drained, exhausted, I struggle a bit to concentrate and almost not with it...
Should I stop I.F and start having breakfast after my run? Will this help? Or should I just power through until I get used to it?

I should add I'm 28, 5ft 6 male, just under 11 stone (152 lbs), my only plan is to be fit, lose my little beer belly and feel good.",2019-04-30 14:39:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/bj42tp/feeling_drained_all_day_after_morning_run/
bek9l1,Fitness,I need to run a 10 k by next sunday (10 days).,"I need some advice here just to make sure I'm in the best possible condition by the day of the race.

To start with, 34 M, height 1,85 mt, weight 77 kg. I'm in decent shape, I do 16 flight of stairs most mornings, do a (mild) full body workout 3 times a week, intermittent fasting for a couple of years (I skip breakfast).

My brother (40) runs and wants us to do a 10 k that's held in my city april the 28th. I used to run a lot several years ago (10 k every day) but I've mostly stopped.

Last week I couldn't run at all because I had a nasty cold, yesterday was the first day I could go for a run, I wanted to run 7.5 k ended up running 8 k in 47.24, a 5.48 average pace. Not horrid, could be better but I'll take it. Today my legs are tired and I have DOMS, but not too much.

My aim is to complete the 10 k in 1 hour tops. I was thinking about running again saturday (8k), then tuesday (10k) and thursday (6k, but faster), which should allow me to get to sunday the 28th well rested but in decent shape.

bauqob,Fitness,Is intermittent fasting a good idea for runners?,"Hello;

I’m going to add personal context but really I’m just curious in general if IF is a good idea for runners or people who work-out regularly. Do you think it’s a good idea? What are your experiences with it? For context personally:

So I have been interested in intermittent fasting to lose weight. I’ve done it for a while now and I pair it with exercise, which typically includes running 4.5-5 miles 4 times a week, and various weight training exercise 4 times a week. I’ve gotten to a point where I notice I’m much more hungry on average than I used to be, but I’m also a lot more exhausted after going to the gym and at times I feel as if I won’t make it through a workout before running out of energy. Additionally, while I used to be excited to go to the gym for the most part, I’ve been experiencing almost a small fear of going to the gym due to my somewhat lower energy (I still push myself to go) and workouts feel more like a body strain than a pump. However, I’m also experiencing a plateau in my weight-loss that has been lasting roughly a month. I’m at a happy weight but I am still about 15-20 pounds from my goal.

ba7no1,Fitness,Guidance needed for a complete fitness novice - completely confused by all the conflicting exercise and diet info out there!,"Hi everyone!

My new years resolution was to get in shape, lose weight and strengthen my body generally. I'm 43, and decided that I need to act now before I'm too much older and find it more difficult.

I think I'm reasonably fit, I'm female, 163cm tall and 61kg. I'm rarely sat down day to day, and enjoy walking my dog daily.

As I'm a complete fitness novice I downloaded a free fitness app which encouraged starting with the beginners 30 day full body routine. I completed that, and now pick from the list of routines for targeted body areas. I also have a plank app, and although I struggle with plank variations still (my arm strength is pathetic), I can now hold a classic plank for over 1 minute.

I've lost an inch and a half around my waist, and 3kgs since the start of January, without dieting. My glutes have definitely become stronger, but this is the only physical difference I can see in 3 months. Am I expecting too much in only 3 months? Now that I've finished the pre-programmed routine I feel a bit lost, and struggle with keeping the momentum up.

Also, I'm considering intermittent fasting to limit calories as I've noticed that I feel much less hungry during the day if I skip breakfast.

Up to now, I've been doing the exercise app a minimum of 5 times a week. Originally I did around 15 minutes daily but now I'm up to around 50. Sometimes I wonder if I'm doing too much? My loses have definitely slowed down, despite upping the time I work out daily.

My stomach is my main problem area, in that it's flabby and although the plank has helped I feel I need something more. A complication with this is that I have a hernia, which causes me almost no problem in day to day life but I cannot do sit-ups or leg raises etc.

Any general advice would be much appreciated because despite my progress I'm concerned that my motivation level is dropping! Thanks everyone! ",2019-04-06 18:57:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ba7no1/guidance_needed_for_a_complete_fitness_novice/

b6dqdy,Fitness,Advice Needed: How Can I Maintain a “Competition Cut” Look for a Week?,"TL:DR // I need advice on how to maintain a cut/dehydrated look for a week. I am scheduled for a week of photoshoots that require *near* bodybuilding competition ready appearance. Current diet and training provided below as required by the FAQ section

I read the community guidelines and FAQ section on here and on the BodyBuilding subreddit but couldn’t find the answer to my question. 

#My Current Info, Diet, & Training
According to the FAQ, here are my post requirements:
* 164lbs, 5’6”, Female, 26, approximately 21% body fat 
* Preparing for a bodybuilding Photoshoots 
* No serious injuries
* I tried intermittent fasting, and dehydrating for my last photoshoot for the first time and worked well. My fat loss currently hit a plateau at ~21%

I keep a food journal and the last 4 weeks have averaged 125g Protein, 65g Fat, 75g carbs. Fasted  cardio 2 mornings a week. Rotate between weight lifting and HIIT on evenings 5 days a week. I do intermittent 16/8 hour fasting a few days a week as well. I workout frequently so I’m not sure if I’m too low on calories during this cut but I’m not seeming to lose anymore fat. 

#What I need help with
I wanted to know more about prepping and dehydrating before an event. I do amateur bodybuilding and have already researched how to prepare for a competition.

A few months ago, I had a photoshoot that required competition style prepping with dehydrating. This was totally doable since the photoshoot was only for a day and I could have time afterward to rehydrate and reintroduce carbs slowly over the weeks following. The dehydration, carb depletion, and fasting I did worked. 

However, I have a week of photoshoots planned with several photographers. I obviously can’t stay dehydrated for a whole week. My biggest concern is holding on to excess water weight and glycogen. What would be the best way to maintain looking trim and cut during a week traveling and photographing without upsetting my body?

b1nwn8,Fitness,SL 5x5 and Leangains/IF. Hitting a wall or should I power through? (Stats/pics included),"**Current Stats:**

* 6'3""/M/200lbs
* Squats: 260 (was up to 280 before self induced deload)
* Deads: 245
* BB Rows: 145
* OHP: 130
* Bench: 230

Started SL 5x5 on Oct 28, 2018. I was loose 225 (not fat/skinnyfat/etc - just kind of a meh physique teetering on dad bod). Was fit up until college (weightlifted), then life/marriage/parenthood, blah blah blah. Typical victim puke stuff. So when I started the present routine, I didn't miss a single workout or hit a single failure rep until January 21, or approximately 3 months in. My diet was pretty up in the air at that point, just basically eating clean when I was hungry with no attention to macros beyond hitting my weight in grams of protein. No alcohol.

February 1, or about 6 weeks ago, I started taking my diet seriously. I tracked every morsel of food in MFP, and weighed myself every AM at the same time after waking up. I was/am following a leangains caloric/macro diet, without the IF timing. I'm focused on cutting at the moment, but alas here I am wondering what the hell I'm doing to myself.

I'm kind of at a cathartic crisis and not sure if I'm doing anything right. I'm mentally still into my workouts, but my body feels like I'm hitting the rev limiter. I've been fighting chronic tendonitis in the knees the past couple months that's finally getting a little better. On good days I feel like I have more in the tank with squats, and for sure deadlifts, but the volume is a killer right now and hinders/stops me on my ""off days"". This morning - got up at 4 like I normally do, got my PWO and a couple oranges in me, and went through my squat warmups. Got to my first set of 5, finished it, but my body just couldn't do it. Felt off. Walked upstairs pissed off.

I'll throw out a couple options I've brainstormed, and hoping some of you can offer input:

1) Power through the fuckarounditis, get back onto the exact SL 5x5 program where my weights currently are for another couple months until I'm a solid ~15%BF, then clean bulk. My only concern is not listening to my body.

2) Call the linear gains a done deal and move onto a 531 variation. Keep cutting on my modified leangains (sans IF) diet, or clean bulk?

3) Look into adhering to the intermittent fasting portion of leangains, and lower my SL volume to 3x5 across the board.

4) Quit the fancy leangains/IF stuff, and go by a simple -500 cut/+500 bulk

**Sleep:** Min 7 hours, no more than 8. Quality is shit. Wake up at least once a night between 12:30AM and 2:30AM)

**Special factors:** Just finished 8 weeks of an EC stack, and will titrate my caffeine intake back to 0/minimal starting tomorrow

**Leangains Diet:**
Workout Days (Mon,Wed,Fri): 2615 kcals (281C, 186P, 83F)
Rest Days (Tues,Th,Sat,SunO: 1741 kcals (40C, 186P, 93F)

**TL;DR** I don't want to give up on ""beginner gains"" if there's more in the linear progression tank, but I don't want to keep feeling this way either. I know the SL app is supposed to hand hold through failure sets/deloads, and at this point, I'm not really doing SL. I'm drunk driving my own routine. Help on everything.

(Words in bold are the main pieces of information for those who don't care to read my entire post.)

&#x200B;

**I've been following Martin Berkhan's paradigm of leangains (reverse pyramid training, intermittent fasting, extremely-high protein, and carb/fat/caloric cycling) since last June and while I've obtained decent results, I'm unsure how I should proceed from my current state and I'm posting to ask for advice and suggestions.** Please bear with my lengthy post -- I'm an overanalyzer and overthinker, and I sorely need some advice/constructive criticism to set me straight. **For reference, here are some pictures I took this morning of my physique, without any water/food consumption and after using the restroom:** [**https://imgur.com/a/UeEjoUL**](https://imgur.com/a/UeEjoUL)

&#x200B;

**I have a history of fuckarounditis and I understand my current physique and strength is mediocre given that I started lifting 5.5 years ago and have been tracking calories for the past 2+ years.** When I began adhering to RPT ([https://leangains.com/reverse-pyramid-training-guide/](https://leangains.com/reverse-pyramid-training-guide/)) in early-June 2018, I was roughly 170 lbs and cut to 155 by October; and then I bulked to 159 between mid-October until the New Year's. I've been on a cut again since the start of the new year because I realized I was at a much higher body fat percentage than I had thought myself to be (around 15% by my visual estimation.) Now, I'm sitting below 150 for the first time since I was a junior in high school. I think I am currently at 10-11% body fat and I am internally debating whether I should cut for a few more weeks or start to increase my calories and ease into a lean bulk.

&#x200B;

**My current stats are 5'8 and 149.3 lbs** (today's weigh-in)/150.6 lbs (latest weekly average), and **my most recent topsets for the major lifts were: 8x245 Squat, 6x370 TnG Conventional Deadlift, 3x185 Bench, 6xBW+80 Chin-Ups, and 4x125 Overhead Press**. My strength has regressed likely due to my physical activity (I bike-commute everywhere) and do yoga 3-4 days a week on top of low-intensity cardio (incline walking at a 13 grade and 2.8 mph on a treadmill) 4 days a week all the while eating at a caloric deficit. **I've been steadily losing weight at roughly 0.6 to 0.7 lbs a week with a weekly average caloric consumption of 2200, and this corresponds to an average TDEE of \~2675. I am carb and calorie cycling; 2700 on workout days and 1800 on rest days - generally hitting 400 carbs/220 protein/20 fat in the former and 40-70 carbs/180-190 protein/90-100 fat in the latter.** I track all the food I consume down to the gram and maintain a spreadsheet of my daily body weight.

&#x200B;

**Current routine:**

Mondays: bike commute (35-ish minutes of cycling); active rest day - easy yoga routine  
Tuesdays: bike commute, 1 mile on treadmill @ 13 grade and 2.8 mph, easy yoga routine  
Wednesdays: bike commute, lifting + 1 mile on treadmill @ 13 grade and 2.8 mph  
Thursdays: bike commute; active rest day - 1.5 hour slow-flow yoga class at a studio  
Fridays: bike commute, lifting + 1 mile on treadmill @ 13 grade and 2.8 mph  
Saturdays: bike ride (25-ish minutes of cycling) - if no bike ride, 1.5 mile on treadmill at same settings; deep stretch yoga routine at home (30-40 mins)  
Sundays: bike commute, lifting + 1 mile on treadmill @ 13 grade and 2.8 mph

*Wednesdays:* 2x6 RPT Deadlifts, 3x8 RPT OHP, 2x10 RPT Curls  
*Fridays:* 3x8 RPT Bench, 3x8 RPT Chest-Supported Rows, 2x10 RPT Close Grip Bench Press, 3x20 Face Pulls  
*Sundays:* 3x8 RPT Squat, 2x15 Seated Calf Raise, 3x8 RPT Weighted Chin-Ups

On RPT, my best working sets were (Nov-Dec lifts):  
TnG Deadlift: 405x11  
Low-Bar Squat: 8x260  
Bench Press: 7x180/6x185  
Overhead Press: 6x125

My personal all-time PR's are:  
Touch-and-Go Sumo Deadlift: 405x11 @ \~156 - back in mid-November  
Low-Bar Squat: 8x260 @ 158 - January 6, 2019  
Bench Press: 1x235 @ \~165 - back in January 2015  
Overhead Press: 1x165 @ \~160 - back in August 2016

**All of this is to say, I'd like to hear thoughts about where I should proceed from here: do I keep cutting to set myself up for a longer bulk or stop cutting and start bulking - I would say my utmost priority is to increase my muscle mass especially with a focus on the upper body while staying lean and strength is secondary to my current goals (although I know they're not mutually exclusive)**; and while I understand gaining fat inevitably accompanies muscle synthesis, even getting to 13-14% destroys my confidence -- and this has contributed to my fuckarounditis and me spinning my wheels. If I am to lean-bulk, I've been considering Martin's 4-day RPT program, PHUL, Fierce 5, and PHAT, and I would be open to any other programs. However, time is a major consideration for me given my obligations as a PhD student -- 4 days is doable for me and I'm hesitant to commit to a 5 day program, but summer break is coming in less than two months so I should have more time for the gym then. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Should I be on a caloric defecit on account of the extra fat I need to lose? Or is that going to kill my gains?

aorzzi,Fitness,Review of Recent Fitness Studies IV: Caffeine Tolerance? Is Too Much Sleep Harmful? How Much Protein Per Meal?,"Hey guys, it's been awhile! Hope you are all having a wonderful Chinese new year for those who celebrate. As usual, I've collected a few interesting studies and wrote short summaries of them for all of you to read. All for educational purposes and to spark some discussion. The paper on sleep is not entirely related to fitness but it is health-related and I thought it would be interesting nonetheless.

The first study we will look at is a review written by Schoenfeld & Aragon (2018) and it asks the question: how much protein can muscles use for growth in one meal? This is actually a common question thrown around in the fitness world as a lot of people want to be as efficient as possible and want to maximize protein’s effects on muscle growth in each meal. However, as odd as it sounds, sometimes the question is asked incorrectly. For the question above, some people will ask how much protein can be absorbed in one meal as opposed to how much can be used for muscle growth maximally. All protein will be absorbed but the real question is what happens to all of it afterwards.

The review highlights the study conducted by Areta et al. (2013) which is commonly cited to say that 20–25 grams of protein is the maximum number that muscles can use for hypertrophy (muscular growth). In this study, trained individuals were given different amounts of protein in a 12 hour period post-workout. Some were supplemented with 10 grams every 1.5 hours, some 20 grams every 3 hours and some 40 grams every 6 hours. In this experiment, the group that consumed 20 grams had the greatest rates of muscle protein synthesis (a fancy term to describe the building of muscles with protein). This would suggest that eating around 20 grams of protein at a time would be the best for building muscle. The biggest limitation that this review noted in the aforementioned study was that the total protein amounts used over the 12 hour period were quite low practically. Individuals training for hypertrophy would be consuming much greater amounts of protein overall.

To challenge the previous study, the review presents a paper done by Macnaughton et al. (2016) in which 40 grams of protein elicited greater muscle protein synthesis than 20 grams in the context of full body training. Another experiment carried out by Kim et al. (2016) found that 70g of beef protein showed a more significant anabolic response than 40g of beef protein. However, it should be noted that this response was measured as a whole body response and not just for muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it is impossible to say which amount is better for muscle protein synthesis in the context of this study.

For women, Arnal et al. (1999, 2000) found that one meal with a large amount of protein was better than the same amount spread across several meals in regards to muscle retention. These results are interesting but a limitation to extrapolation is that no resistance training was taking place amongst the subjects.

Muscle retention is also similar between those who follow intermittent fasting and those who diet continuously (Seimon et al., 2015). This would suggest that daily protein taken all at once would have the same effects on muscle as spreading out your protein intake across the day.

In the end, the authors of this review recommend 0.4–0.55 g/kg/meal which follows daily recommended intakes stated in a meta-analysis produced by Morton et al. (2017).

**TL;DR:** It still is not clear what the optimum number of grams of protein per meal for maximizing muscular growth is but 0.4–0.55 g/kg/meal appears to be a safe recommendation based on the current literature.

We will now eat into a study done by Lee et al. (2018) in which differences between the conventional deadlift and the Romanian deadlift were investigated. For those who do not know what a Romanian deadlift is, it is essentially a normal deadlift starting from the top (barbell at waist) and then descending the barbell down until the hamstrings cannot stretch any further while not flexing at the lumbar spine. The knees cannot bend further than roughly 15 degrees. It may sound like a stiff-legged deadlift, however, in a stiff legged deadlift, you generally start from the bottom and your knees are allowed to bend more allowing you to bring the barbell to the floor. If you are referring to the straight-legged deadlift, the knees would not flex at all and the barbell would not drag along the legs in the descent.

The study recruited 21 males with at least 3 years of both conventional and Romanian deadlift experience with their training occurring at least twice a week. The first day involved 1 repetition maximum testing as this would facilitate selecting the appropriate load for the participants during the trial (subjects would be doing 5 reps of each lift at 70% of their 1 repetition maximum). To examine muscle activation, the scientists used electromyography. To put it simply, this is where electrodes are pasted over certain muscles to measure the electrical activity from the muscles.

The conventional deadlift showed more activation in the rectus femoris (a quadricep muscle, one that helps extend your knee and flex your hip) and slightly more activation in the gluteus maximus (your butt). Activation of the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) was similar between the two lifts which is interesting considering that many believe that the Romanian deadlift helps target the hamstrings better compared to the conventional deadlift.

Torque (force produced about a joint) was much higher in the knee for the conventional deadlift which was probably expected considering the knee goes through a much larger range of motion. Similarly, the torque measured at the ankles were also higher in the conventional deadlifts which may suggest higher calf muscle activity though this was not measured in the study.

Some important design aspects to note that affect generalizability is that we may see different results with different loads/intensities. Another issue regarding intensity is that the loads were selected according to the 1 repetition maximum of the subject’s Romanian deadlift. Therefore, the conventional deadlift loads may not truly be 70% of their conventional deadlift 1 repetition maximum. It is safe to say that the intensities in this study were likely not matched. Finally, the hamstrings consist of several muscles but only one hamstring muscle was observed during the experiment.

**TL;DR:** The conventional deadlift may be better at targetting the quadriceps and the gluteal muscles. Against what is commonly thought, the Romanian deadlift may not be better than the conventional deadlift at hitting the hamstrings, however, more comprehensive electromyography analysis should be done before making a solid statement.

EDIT: As pointed out by u/bleearch, the Romanian deadlift may be beneficial for those who have knee problems as you get to enjoy the same hamstring activation while going through less knee torque.

A large study conducted by Wild et al. (2018) explored the effects of duration of sleep on cognition. The team created a questionnaire which tested various human cognitive aspects like short-term memory, reasoning, spatial working and planning. However, the main areas that were being observed were short term memory, reasoning and verbal ability. At the same time, questions about sleep were asked to see the relationship between the person’s sleep and their cognitive ability. The questionnaire was set up as an online survey in which they were able to gather 10,886 subjects.

Firstly, it appears that as a person ages, their sleep duration decreases.

All areas of cognition were affected by sleep duration except for short term memory. This is likely because short term memory is a low-order cognitive process, it is not as complex as something like problem solving. Looking at the graphs below, we can clearly see an inverted-U for almost all cognitive areas which tells us that both too little and too much sleep has negative effects on cognition. Even when the authors thinned the analyzed subjects by removing extremes from both ends of the results, they still saw the inverted-U.

https://imgur.com/NFHXzuV

The most optimal sleep duration for overall cognitive ability according to these results is 7.38 hours. Any duration over 8 hours likely has a negative effect on cognition and the authors were able to reliably find negative effects below 6.26 hours of sleep. It was also highlighted that even a single night of sleep had effects on cognition the next day. People who are chronically poor sleepers can benefit from just a single night of good quality sleep and the same vice-versa (good sleepers are affected by one bad night). Sleeping less than usual or sleeping 2.76 hours more than usual on one night showed negative effects for cognition on average.

Despite sleep duration decreasing with age, the results showed that age has no effect on the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive ability. An interesting fact illustrated by this study is that if one were to sleep less than four hours in a night, you would experience a cognitive impairment that is the same as adding 8 years to your age (cognitive ability worsens with age).

Clear limitations of this study include the cross-sectional nature of the study (we are only looking at a snapshot of these people’s lives, long term effects of sleep duration are not seen), the lack of people over 70 years old as well as children / adolescents and the fact that all these results were self-reported. Regarding the last point, the authors explain that the self-reporting still has moderate correlation with objective data.

**TL;DR:** Getting 7 hours of sleep appears to be optimal for cognition. Sleeping any less or more shows some cognitive deficit. Even a one night’s sleep can show acute effects on cognition.

The next study is a new meta-analysis done by Grgic et al. (2019) seeing whether or not the time of the day you do your training has an effect on muscle growth or strength. A meta analysis is where you pool the results of several studies together and is generally seen as the greatest form of scientific evidence. Previous research appears to be equivocal in regards to the effects of training time and muscle strength/growth with some studies showing a more positive effect in evening training and some presenting no difference at all between times.

In total, the authors collected 11 studies for analysis. At baseline, people were stronger in the evening which suggests that people are naturally stronger in the evening. The authors postulate that this could be due to increased body temperatures in the evening or perhaps some hormonal reason. People who trained in the morning had no difference between strength tests in the morning or evening. However, those who trained the evening were stronger than they were in the morning. This introduces a benefit to morning training as it will make you stronger throughout the entire day in contrast to evening training which would only make you stronger in the evening. In terms of muscle hypertrophy, no differences were found at all.

Unfortunately, all of these studies used maximal voluntary contractions to measure strength instead of 1 repetition maximum tests. 1 repetition maximum tests are more practical because they test the strength of movements that you actually train in the gym. There are also not many studies looking at time of training and muscle hypertrophy thus presenting a gap in the literature. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of participants’ ages.

**TL;DR:** People seem to be stronger in the evening at baseline, however, unlike evening training, morning training will make you stronger throughout the entire day. Any conclusions regarding muscle growth is difficult to make due to the paucity of research on the subject though for now there appears to be no relationship.

The last paper we will look at was written by Gonçalves et al. (2017). Caffeine is a stimulant that is often consumed prior to training to boost muscular strength and endurance. Its effects are well documented and the research strongly supports caffeine as a valuable ergogenic aid (Grgic et al., 2018). The paper at hand investigated the effects of habitual caffeine intake on its efficacy during training. In other words, they ask if one were to consume caffeine regularly, would they build a tolerance to it and experience less of its benefits in training?

The most likely theory for the way caffeine works is that it binds to adenosine receptors in the body. Amongst many functions, adenosine can make one feel sleepy and even bring down the heart rate of the body. Now, the worries that caffeine may have a reduced effect with habitual intake stem from the process where caffeine use will cause the body to create more adenosine receptors which allows more adenosine to bind to its receptors.

The scientists recruited 40 male, trained cyclists to take part in the experiment. The study was designed in a crossover manner and in a double-blinded fashion. A crossover study means that all the participants got to try all treatments. In this case, every subject was supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine for a week, was given a placebo for another week and was given nothing for another week. A double blind simply means that neither the scientists nor the subjects knew which treatment was being administered which helps reduce bias.

The cyclists were grouped according to their caffeine intake prior to being recruited into the study. The low intake group consumed 58 mg/day on average, the moderate intake group at 143 mg/day and the high intake group at 351 mg/day. To put these numbers into perspective, the high intake group is worth about 4.5 250ml cans of Red Bull in terms of caffeine.

The first day involved some simple body measurements as well as some testing to determine how much the cyclists needed to perform during real testing later on. The next couple of days consisted of familiarization with the time trial tests that the cyclists would have to do. The time trial basically required each cyclist to cycle a certain amount and then the time to completion would be measured. Caffeine 24 hours before the time trial was restricted and a 24 hour dietary recall before each test was also implemented to control caffeine intake. Subjects fasted 6 hours before each time trial and if they were being supplemented with 6 mg/kg of caffeine, it was done 1 hour before the time trial. Rate of perceived exertion was also measured throughout the trial.

Cyclists performed 2–3% better when on caffeine compared to placebo/control. There was no difference between placebo and control. Rate of perceived exertion was similar between all treatments.

The same trends were seen regardless of caffeine intake habits. That is to say, even they were in the high habitual intake group, the benefits from caffeine were the same.

It would appear that regardless of whether or not you consume a lot of caffeine, you can still reap all the ergogenic benefits of the stimulant. However, I am curious to see if we would see the same results in a strength training context. Also, it is worth noting that these results can only be generalized to males.

**TL;DR:** Whether you use a lot of caffeine or not, you will not build a tolerance and not experience less benefits during training.

amspkg,Fitness,Question about energy drinks,"I drink Monster Absolutely Zero, which lists zero sugar carbs on the can.  I've cut out all tea, coffee and soda and my weight has been dropping steadily the last 2 months.  I've heard the FDA (in the United states) doesn't require everything to be on the can and for myself, Keto has been working very well.  

I'm sure a few will say there are better ways to do this, buy I need SOME source of caffeine to get going daily.  I use water and crystal light for the majority of my water intake per day, but I'm drinking 3 to 4 of the 16 ounce monsters to 'get going' or wake up since I currently work 12 to 16 hours per day. 

Does anyone know anything detrimental to my diet or weight loss journey.  I have been addicted to caffeine for over 30+ years and I've completely 'stopped' twice for over 200+ days at a shot, but it takes over a full month of feeling like I can't get any energy at all to get there.  I can't do that at this time, so I'm hoping for 2 things.

1.  Is there any info people can give me about Erythritol (the main sugar substitute for Monster) I'm watching EVERYTHING like a hawk this time and I've been able to drop 27 lbs so far, I'm hoping by planning and watching as well as educating myself I can keep this going to my goal of 100 lbs gone (which would make me 'normal')
2. Secondly, if there is anything anyone can suggest to keep this focus going and to avoid plateaus I'd appreciate it as well. I have looked at intermittent fasting and it seems to help me bust through so far, but it's not a fun time.  I will be adding exercise back into my routine (slowly) starting middle of next week. 

Thank you for any info and suggestions, I'm tired of being the fattest man in the room and hope getting info from others will help this journey to actually work this time.  ",2019-02-03 19:04:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/amspkg/question_about_energy_drinks/
am5tcx,Fitness,Intermittent Fasting while trying to build muscle?,"Hi there,

I'm relatively new to fitness and recently have been focusing on my diet more. I have started IF and only eat from 12:00 - 8:00, and not eating for the other 16 hours.

Within these 8 hours, I try to eat as much as I can, often eating 3 meals a day. I have also incorporated a lot of healthier foods, such as eating: oats w peanut butter, almond milk, chopped almonds, fruits, and adding leafy greens veggies for my ""dinner"", and finishing the day off with Greek yogurt w fruits and nuts. I also have a baked sweet potato as a snack sometime in those 8 hours.

I'd like to think that I'm meeting my daily calorie count and have been eating healthier in general.

The question that I have is: is it worth doing IF when I'm eating all of this? Or should I just disregard IF and eat my oats when I wake up?

I'm still a bit uncertain on what IF 100% does but apparently it allows your body to burn more fat because of the fasted state?",2019-02-01 19:31:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/am5tcx/intermittent_fasting_while_trying_to_build_muscle/

n0y99d,veganrecipes,Salad Ingredients to go with Hemp Seeds and Apple Cider Vinegar,"Hi there, couldn't find the small questions general thread so thought I'd expand my question.

I'm looking to get back to a vegan diet, my health has suffered since I stopped years ago from depression and financial issues, but I'm in a better place now and want my diet and health to reflect that too.  Plus it's easier on my mental health not feeling like I'm contributing to pain and suffering in the world...

I'm gonna be doing a combination of intermittent fasting with a vegan diet so I'm looking for simple ingredients to do salads (mainly) that'll still have a great taste to help get over the addiction factor that'll kick in once I cut down on sugar, oil, fat, and all of those artificial tastes and chemical preservatives.   Organic would be best to avoid the various pesticides/herbicides too.

My base ingredients for salads are going to be Hemp Seeds and Apple Cider Vinegar, I would love if anyone had any extra yummy salad recipes to share that would pair well with these.  Whether fruit or normal leafy greens, just need some ideas to make some variety across a week.

The only other ingredients I'll have on hand are a mixture of nuts (cashews, pecans, almonds, etc) and Coconut Oil.

Anyone care to share any recipe ideas with those ingredients in mind?

Small snack recipes would be nice too.

I'm not exactly the brightest star in the sky so don't be afraid to make even simple suggestions, I probably wouldn't have thought of them as fast or found them as fast as just having someone mention them to me since I'm looking to start transitioning this weekend.  I spent a week sick from food poisoning and finally recovered from it fully today so, it was the wake-up call I needed to kick myself back into a better way of life.

1dy1v7s,gainit,"Year 1 -> Year 2 (M25, 6'0: 183 lbs -> 217 lbs -> 195lbs)","# PROGRESS PICS: [https://imgur.com/a/kqpXGyv](https://imgur.com/a/kqpXGyv)

# Preface

* Starting weight: 183lbs
* Ending weight: 195 lbs
* Age: 25-26 years old
* Height: 6'0

Hi everyone, so if you've visited this community some time last year you might recognize me from a previous post where I shared my progress for the first year of my training. The first imgur picture is a bit misleading. I went from the 2nd pic (183 lbs) to the 3rd pic (195 lbs). The first pic (164 lbs) is from my previous post but I thought I'd show it this way so the whole 2 year progression can be seen. Since my previous post received a lot of attention and people were interested in my progress, I've decided to make a sequel with even more detail.

# Diet

For my diet I followed the same method of calculating my TDEE from last year. For those unfamiliar, TDEE is a number that is calculated based off weight and height, and it gives you the number of calories you need to hit every day to maintain my weight. For example, for my current height and weight (6'0 and 195 lbs) I would need about 2616 calories per day. This means if I ate exactly that amount of food everyday, my weight should not change. This tool is great because depending on whether you plan to bulk or cut, the number you need to hit is very easy to find out.

**\*Supplements\***

For supplements I only take protein powder, creatine, and preworkout. You don't really need supplements tbh but they can help alot for hitting macros or energy and they're pretty cheap if you know where to look. I also take melatonin gummies sometimes but that's just because I have trouble sleeping due to irregular sleep schedules when I'm very busy.

**\*Approach\***

For my meals I tend to keep them as simple and consistent as possible. This is definitely the biggest hurdle for people to get their diet right. They know what they should eat but it's not easy for them, like how do you expect to eat rice, broccoli and chicken breast everyday? The answer is you don't (sort of). I'm going to talk about the foods I used for bulking and cutting below but the secret of my consistency is to eat ALMOST the same thing every day. I try to change the variations up all the time with each variation of meals hitting my calories so things aren't boring all the time. You can do this in many clever ways like substituting rice for noodles, chicken for beef/pork/fish, broccoli for other vegetables, and trying new sauces. There really isn't much variation in macros as long as you get a decent amount of protein in. You might say ""Oh but don't chicken thighs have worse protein to fat ratios than chicken breast so it's not as good?"". You are correct but would you rather have a bland flavourless chicken breast or a juicy chicken thigh covered in low calorie sauce for dinner? Even if you do stick with chicken breast all the time, you'll probably stop at some point and relapse to unhealthier foods just because having that everyday is so difficult. It's better to accept some variation and flavour if it means consistency. A moderate consistent diet is better than an overly optimal one that is a chore to maintain. If you need help with finding food macros I suggest MyFitnessPal (also I don't factor in calories burned when using this app)

**\*Bulking\***

For bulking my strategy is to lean bulk at approx. 0.5 lbs per week for as long as possible. This means taking my TDEE and adding about 300 calories. In this case if I wanted to bulk now I would need to eat on average 2616 + 300 = 2916 calories everyday. I don't have a goal number to end the bulk necessarily but I try to lean bulk consistently for as long as possible, most likely 9+ months. This is because lean bulking (slowly increasing calories as weight increases) is the most effective method for gaining muscle without excess fat. Lean bulking is so effective in fact that even if I didn't train as well I would still gain strength (especially for beginners). This is why diet is so much more important than training and also why i'm talking about it first. I listed a sample meal plan with associated calories and alternative foods below. I also eat protein powder with yogurt mixed with a bit of water for consistency because it tastes better than just water + protein powder.

Breakfast (746 cal)

* 1 bagel (230 cal)
   * toast / tortilla
* 1 avocado (240 cal)
   * sauce / deli / any meat
* 2 boiled eggs (156 cal)
   * sauce / deli / any meat
* 1 can tuna (120 cal)

Lunch (857 cal)

* 200g cup Skyr/Greek yogurt (147 cal)
* 2 cups protein powder (240 cal)
* 2 tablespoons peanut butter (200 cal)
* 0.25 cup frozen fruit (70 cal)
   * any fresh fruit tbh, they're all low calories
* 1 cookie (200 cal)
   * any cookie with good texture with similar calories, this is only for flavour tbh

Dinner (1370 cal)

* 1.5 cups of cooked rice (300 cal)

   * ground beef / sausage / chicken breast / steak / fish
* 2 tbsp any sauce (200 cal)
* 2 tbsp peanut butter (200 cal)

---Total: 2973 cal---

**\*Cutting\***

With cutting not much has changed from bulking. I simply removed a few high calorie items like peanut butter and eat less in general. This way my habit of eating food is not too drastic and easy to transition to. I also don't eat breakfast as I do intermittent fasting when cutting out of convenience. For me eating 3 big meals in a time window is more effective than having smaller meals across the whole day. Energy is pretty important when it comes to cutting so having a meal 2 hrs before working out or taking pre workout immediately beforehand can be very useful for getting through the whole workout. I start cutting for summer usually around March which is when I also start feeling too fat and I'm getting diminishing returns from lean bulking. I tend to cut at a pace of 1 lb per week so this means taking my TDEE at my bulked weight and taking 500 calories off. For example if I were to continue cutting now I would need 2616 - 500 = 2116 calories per day.

Lunch (630 cal)

* Tortilla (320 cal)
   * toast / bagel

# Training

**\*Compound lift PRs\***

* Squat: 385 lbs x 1 -> 405 lbs x 1
* Bench: 205 lbs x 1 -> 225 lbs x 6
* (Conventional) Deadlift: 475 lbs x 1 -> 545 lbs x 1
* Barbell rows: 275 lbs x 4

**\*Other random lift PRs\***

* RDLs: 425 lbs x 5
* Tricep pushdown: 210 lbs x 12
* Hammer curls: 65 lbs x 8
* Lat raises: 50 lbs x 10

**\*Approach\***

My training approach hasn't really changed much since last year. I mainly train for hypertrophy and sometimes focus on strength. I tend to get bored of training solely focusing on powerlifting or bodybuilding style training so I change training approaches frequently. This is similar to my approach in dieting as I'm not focusing solely training for optimal results but factoring in what is most fun for me at the moment. It works well for me, even though I could be theoretically stronger by specializing in one area, because training with fun as a priority makes you more consistent if you look forward to training.

Another approach I implemented is focusing on specific muscle types more than others. Popular training plans like PPL give an equal focus on upper and lower body muscles but I find that some people like myself have better inherent strength in certain muscles than others. For example, my lower body is way stronger than my upper body even accounting for the usual strength difference between the two. I always had big legs so instead of giving equal attention to legs I typically only do it once a week, sometimes even doing 3 sets of squats and then just doing back exercises for the rest of the ""leg day"". I also do have knee injuries rn so that's why I haven't been squatting consistently for months now.

Certain muscles can recover faster than others. That's why I deadlift with max effort infrequently and always with long rest periods (3+ mins) but can get away with bench pressing with high effort multiple times a week with low rest periods (1-2 mins). The order for exercises is also important. Typically it's better to do compound lifts (benching, squatting, deadlifts, OHP, barbell rows) at the start of your workout because they require more muscles to use and save the isolation exercises like arm exercises for the last part.

In order to simplify my workouts I typically don't have much variation as I find that overcomplicated training can lead to inefficient results. Just because some influencer says you should do an elaborate workout that will target some obscure tiny muscle doesn't mean it's good for you. Maybe if you're more experienced you should put more emphasis on them but that's because everything else should already be developed by then. Typically compound exercises and a few isolation exercises for bigger muscles like lats, delts, hamstrings are good enough when starting out, which is why you'll recognize almost all the exercises I list below.

In order to track my progress I typically use an input spreadsheet. It's super easy because you just need to input your 1RM (I typically do 90% of my actual PR) and it calculates all the sets and rep ranges for you. You can find lots of them from LiftVault. The one that I've been using a lot is a mix between the Candito 6 week plan and my own exercises. I follow this program because Candito gives me good progress for deadlifting when I implement only the deadlifting exercises as linear progression isn't suitable for me at my current stage. It's also a short program compared to other programs which I find easier to do as it's less boring. Instead of doing the optional lower body accessories I do my own back exercises. For the bench days I do my own regime of chest/shoulders/triceps as I find Candito not ideal for bench progress.

An example of my modified training plan is the first week of Candito 6 week. For the deadlift variations I typically do deficit deadlifts or RDLs depending on which part of the deadlift movement I'm weaker at. For bench press I change the focus from lifting heavier sets for strength with less reps to lighter sets focusing on explosiveness with more reps. I do arm exercises very frequently as you can get away with more volume for them but I tend to cut them out sometimes depending on my energy.  My training plan is a lot of volume sometimes and I typically spend up to 2 hrs in the gym (including pre and post workout stretches). For the later weeks of Candito when the intensity is higher I sometimes drop some of the accessories on deadlifting days. Depends on how I feel that day as a lot of my training is based on intuition.

Here is how week 1 of Candito 6 week + my changes would take place (keep in mind Candito's program changes every week if you look at the spreadsheet so this isn't for every week)

# Closing thoughts

Overall I'm very happy with my second year gym progress. I finally started making a lot of progress with bench and deadlift as I figured out how to do the exercises with better form. I feel a lot more confident than last year as I have much more experience with my body and how to continue when progress stalls. I also reached a level of body size I'm pretty happy with at 195 lbs though I'll likely continue bulking/cutting in the future at slower paces due to diminishing returns and more interest elsewhere.

As always I'm open to questions and thanks for all the continued support.",2024-07-08 06:20:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1dy1v7s/year_1_year_2_m25_60_183_lbs_217_lbs_195lbs/
10paya8,gainit,Projection for bench press progression,"Hi everyone!

Heads-up: everything is in European (superior) format

In the past year I've put a heavy focus on bench press in my training. Going from PPL with 2 push days/week to 3 bench press session/week with variations (routine is lower down).

I've seen good progress and was wondering how far I can get without having to resort to extreme planning/bulking/micro-management etc

First of all I'm a 97kg 179cm man, I've been lifting for the better part of 3 years. I've switched my focus to strength training in the past year.
I've been doing intermittent fasting for the last 5 months and haven't really tracked what I eat besides roughly estimating my daily protein intake (120-150g/day).

Regarding the current results, in the past year I've met the following milestones :
31/01/2022 : 100kg
18/10/2022 : 120kg
~07/02/2023 (planned) : 140kg

And for my current split :

Tuesday : 
- Bench Prench (1,5,5)-RPE10
- Inclined Bench Press 3x4-5-RPE9
- Some chest accessory 3x8
- Triceps Pulldown 3x6-8

Wednesday :
- Pull-up 3 sets RPE10
- Barbell row 3x6-RPE9
- Cable row (8,6,4)-RPE10
- Some biceps curl 3x8

Friday :
- Bench Prench 4x3-RPE9/10
- Inclined Bench Press 3x4-5-RPE9
- Some chest accessory 3x8
- Triceps Pulldown 3x6-8

Saturday :
- Deadlift 5x?-RPE10 (when back healthy)

Sunday :
- Bench press 3x5-RPE10 (1-2 seconds pause)
- Pull-up 3 sets RPE10
- Barbell row 3x6-RPE9
- Cable row (8,6,4)-RPE10
- Some biceps curl 3x8

Monday and Thursday are rest days and I don't do cardio, not for now anyway.
And for progress I only increase weight (by 2,5kg overall weight increment) from week to week, I don't change the reps count.



So now that I've set the scene I would like to now, from your experience, can I hit 180kg in bench and how long would it take? Would I need to adjust my workout or change it completely? What do you guys think?

Is consuming that much protein in one sitting likely killing my appetite? It's prob better to spread my protein out throughout the course of the day, right?

I candidly like eating such a high volume meal after my morning workout, and I just prefer eating only 2 meals a day because that's what I did when cutting, and have enjoyed intermittent fasting because I find it's more efficient throughout my day when I can just eat one big meal, and then not take any meal break during my work sessions, and then have my 2nd big meal at night when I've basically finished all my work. Is there necessarily anything wrong with this schedule? It definitely makes social eating hard because when family/friends make reservations for 6pm, I have no appetite at that time.

tfwm1k,gainit,Looking for some advices on someone who wants to lose some fat and buff up at the same time,"Hey guys.

Im 23, M, 180cm and around 75-80kg. I used to go to the gym a lot 2-3 years ago but it was very inconsistent and has since stopped. Over the years due to college and me procrastinating and drinking beer I noticed I am getting out of fitness. From the outside I guess I look like a normal tall-ish skinny dude. But I also formed a beer belly lol. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, since 2 weeks ago, I've decided to completely stop drinking beer on the weekends and cut down on junk food and started taking gym seriously. I went to gym every single day except for Sundays. At first I felt really tired and my muscles were sore af. But now I feel great and when I wake up my mind actually thinks about going to the gym! (How amazing). 

**So I guess my advice is: If I'm trying to lose my beer belly but at the same time also bulk up and look shredded, what direction should I go from here?** 

As I said, I've completely cut down on any bad food or drinks. I am drinking water constantly. Eating steamed (and then fried) chicken with rice, steamed broccoli, green beans, peppers, onions, potato etc. Sometimes I will buy from restaurants instead of cooking at home. In these cases I make sure to never eat something that is sweet or high in fat. Mostly just meat and fiber rich foods. In the mornings I will usually eat one bag of instant oatmeal with fiber cereal on top of it + 1-2 hardboiled eggs. First of all, **should I be eating a lot more? Or less? or is this fine?** I dont exactly know how to measure my home cooked meal... Its like a bowl full usually you know? Enough to make a dude eat it and sit back and relax. If I had to guess maybe at the least I am eating 1500cal, at most maybe 2000-2500 per day. 

Oh also, during my workouts I am also taking the Six Star Whey Protein (1 scoop 49g mixed with water). 

As for intermittent fasting, I dont eat anything after 8pm, and then nothing until 11am the next day. 

After going for two weeks I noticed some minor changes in my muscle tone. I feel like my biceps are much bigger, especially after workouts, and my chest in general is larger. I feel like I can lift a bit heavier or do more reps than the previous workout, which is a good sign I hope.   
Currently im alternating between upper and lower body workouts per day. 

**Upper is:** 3x chin ups (6-8 reps), 4x bent over row (10 reps), 4x bench press (10 reps), 4x bench press with dumbbell (20 reps), 4x incline bench press (15 reps), 4x overhead press dumbbell (15 reps), 3x lateral raise (10 reps), 3x tricep extension (20 reps), 3x bicep curls (16 reps), 3x cable tricep thingy (15 reps). 

&#x200B;

**Lower is:** 3x chin ups (6-8 reps), 3x barbell squat (8 reps), 3x leg press (15 reps), 3x seated leg curl (12 reps), 3x leg extension (12 reps), 3 standing calf raise (20 reps), 3 abdominal crunch machine (15 reps), 4 side planks (45 second), 3x machine crunch (18 reps)

&#x200B;

15 minute of running before workouts as well. 3 minute intense running followed by 2 minute slow and so on. And of course when at home 100 pushups and sit ups etc.

As for the workout side, I am conflicted. On one hand, one of my friend who is good at gym told me ""these are beginner exercises bro you can do much more"". And I am inclined to agree with him. However I also found these exercise list on a fitness website and they've been working well for me. I am not too tired but still also sweaty and muscles aching at the end of every workout. **Should I increase it? If so, what else should I add? Or should I just keep going like this for a few more weeks?**

&#x200B;

So thats about it for my situation guys. Never posted here before so idk what kind of answers to expect. But any answer that answers one of my questions will be massively helpful!

rhzxnm,gainit,"8 Month Progress. 32M - 5'9"" - 145lbs > 168lbs","**Progress Pics**:  https://imgur.com/zfW1wT8 

I was going to wait a year before I did a progress post but I'm having to take a break from bulking. I've lost all my apatite due to eating 3000-4000 calories a day for 8 months. 

I've always been skinny and always felt like I had a childs body. Putting on weight and muscle is something I've always wanted to do. I've tried several times in the past but I've always given up after about 3 months from not seeing results. I now know this was because of my diet. It seems eating and drinking protein isn't enough to put on weight! This is where various fitness subreddits have helped me understand what is needed. For anyone that's been here a while we all know it comes down to just eat more.

My aim was 12 stone (168lbs) which I managed to get to. I'm now going on a cut just to try get my apatite back. It does feel good not to have to think about food too much and actually enjoy a meal due to feeling hungry. I've been eating only when I'm hungry and not really been tracking anything since I started my cut. This has been going on for about 3 weeks now and my lifts have stayed the same or gone up (oddly). 

I started lifting in April when the UK came out of lock down. I started with a full body split 3 times a week. I did go to the gym for a 4th day but did a bit of cardio and conditioning/physio for my shoulder impingement. I did full body for 4 months but noticed my lifts started to plateau after about 3 months. I then moved onto NSUNS 4 day program. I wish I started this a earlier as it's so much better for linear progression. 

**Current Lifts:**

**Bench**: 95kg x 3   (\~210lbs)

**Squat**:  115kg x 3 (\~250lbs)

**Deadlift**: 120kg x 3 (\~265lbs) I stopped deadlifting for a while as my form was off. I've now started doing it again

**OHP**: 42.5kg x 8 (#90lbs)

&#x200B;

**Diet:**

I started with around 2800 calories a day and tracked everything on MyFitnessPal. I was also doing Intermittent fasting so all my food would be eaten between 11am and 7pm.  I was quite strict to begin with and aimed for 50% Carbs, 25% fat and 25% protein. As the weeks/months went on I had to gradually up my calories up to a point where I was eating 4000 calories a day. I was only able to keep this up for about a week whilst doing intermittent fasting as well. I relaxed a bit on my macros and just aimed for getting enough protein and calories. I dropped intermittent fasting as my apatite was going and it was easier to eat 3k+ calories in a bigger window. 

&#x200B;

**Advice:**

If I have to give any advice to people it will be to make sure you are eating enough and you're following a program. Don't just go to the gym and decide on the day what you want to do. 

Don't guess you calories. Try measure as much as possible. If you have to estimate, try under estimate. I would rather eat more than my daily in take than eat less.

You will have days in which you will not perform as well or even days/weeks where you don't progress and this can really affect you mentally. Just make sure you keep going and get through it.

You will also have weeks in which it doesn't look like you've out on weight or the scales haven't gone up. Just keep going and try to eat more.

I found weighing myself every Sunday morning after going to the toilet the best method for accurate scale results.

Take pictures before and after to see your progress. I'm a little annoyed I didn't take photos of my back or legs so I have nothing to compare it to. My legs have grown and my knees are less boney.",2021-12-16 20:52:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/rhzxnm/8_month_progress_32m_59_145lbs_168lbs/
rfor0w,gainit,"[JUST EAT MORE!] ""How do I eat more?""","People hate this answer. But it's the only answer. Maybe you don't understand the answer?

Instead of asking ""How do I eat more?"", let's ask *""Eat More WHAT?""*

So in no particular order of importance:

_____________________________________________________________________________________

- EAT MORE FOOD. Obvious Goal here. More calories than you burn.

- EAT MORE OFTEN. Now you eat 4-5 meals per day instead of 3 or 2. Stop eating snacks; eat big meals.

- EAT MORE WHEN AWAKE. Basically, use all available hours to eat. Fuck intermittent fasting during gaining.

- EAT MORE FATS. Are you avoiding fats trying to not get fat? Fat is fuel & energy. Add oils & fats to meals.

- EAT MORE CARBS. Afraid of ""insulin-stimulated fat storage?!?"" Carbs are easy. Pancakes, Waffles, Pasta.

- EAT MORE FRUIT/VEGETABLES. Stick with citrus fruits & berries for acidity. Some green stuff every day.

- EAT MORE MUSH. Chewed-food takes too long. Ground beef > chicken. Rice or mashed potatoes > bread.

- EAT MORE FLAVORS. Hyper-palatable foods whet your appetite. Use more salt, more garlic and flavor sauces.

- EAT MORE VOLUME. Don't start with a shake; eat a large meal, *then* chase it with a shake. Stretch the stomach.

- EAT MORE PREDICTABLY. Don't wait for hunger. Set 4 consistent meal-times: 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm etc.

- EAT MORE QUICKLY/SLOWLY. Chow down with purpose. Eat vigorously. When full, slow down & keep nibbling.

- EAT MORE WATER. Push water in-between meal times. 10am, 2pm, 6pm, 10pm etc. Drink 16-20 ounces water.

- EAT MORE FAMILIAR FOODS. Eat more of what you already eat, more of your favorite and easiest foods.

- EAT MORE SIMPLY. Just track calories and get sufficient protein. Don't obsess about macro ratios/percentages.

- EAT MORE CONSISTENTLY. Some days you don't feel like lifting but do anyways. Hit your food target anyway.

- EAT MORE, DAILY! Not just on lifting days. Eat on recovery days, eat on rest days. It keeps your appetite up.

- EAT MORE LEFTOVERS. Make extra, save some in the fridge. Have food ready-to-go in there. (Meal Prep).

- EAT MORE INTENTIONALLY, NOT ACCIDENTALLY. Treat it like training. Set out a plan and follow it.

- EAT MORE OVER TIME. Don't just stack hundreds more calories on. Increase a little bit more every week.

- EAT MORE THANKFULLY! Always remember surplus food is a luxury, and gaining lean mass is a privilege (:

See, I fast at work, and only for about 10-12 hours, which doesn't seem like a crazy amount of time. I'm sure to track my calories, so I'm certain to get ENOUGH as far as the day is concerned. 

Still, the fact that my muscles are in the act of recovering while I'm fasting and... my body obviously wants nutrition, because I'll find myself hungry to the point of nausea at times throughout the day. 

The feeling passes, of course, but my point and the question I'm asking is... is the need there? Am I missing out on gains by not eating at a balanced rate throughout the day?

htjdii,gainit,"21 y/o Male, 5'11 & 170 lbs. First time in my life I will do a bulk, would appreciate it if you could answer my questions & provide any advice you think would be useful.","Hi, so I've been cutting weight on & off for a while. Never bulked before in my life. Today someone suggested that I bulk first and then cut afterwards as the gained muscle would help with losing weight too. I already have a decent amount of body fat, so I'd like to avoid gaining too much fat while on this bulk.

1) I decided to do the Stronglifts 5 x 5 program. Is that a good idea, or would there be a better program for me?

2) Should I do cardio while bulking? Would it help with cutting fat/preventing fat gain? & Even if it doesn't help, can I still do it? Jogging's very therapeutic for me.

3) I'll also be starting to do Brazilian Jiu-Jutsu 5 days a week (Mon - Fri), and out of 2 days I do Stronglifts my lift sessions will be right after I do BJJ (6 - 7 BJJ, after that I'll lift). The timing can't be changed as I have work during the day. The BJJ won't cause an issue with the program & my bulking right?

MON - WED: BJJ
SUN, TUE, THURS: LIFTING 

4) As I would like to minimize my fat gain, what should my caloric surplus be? 

5) Should I do 16:8 Intermittent Fasting as well?

I think that when you are doing stuff like this you have to break some rules sometimes, especially when you are as big as me and the cards aren't in your favour. Also, I'm kinda tired of everyone here posting chicken breast with broccoli or one small peanut butter jelly sandwich with a glass of milk and a cup of tiny oats as ""the key to gaining"".

Cold instant coffee w/ one muffin - (Breakfast / 242 calories)

* Picture is not here because I had the idea to do this right before lunch. Just imagine one chocolate muffin with a tall cup of cold coffee.

Every morning that I wake up I always make instant coffee with milk. I whip this up in under 30 seconds and I practically chug my coffee. I skip regular breakfast because I don't like eating very early & I eat sweets every morning to give me that kickstart for the beginning of the day when I am most productive. I also skip normal breakfast to get in the mindset of faux-intermittent fasting when I cut.

https://i.imgur.com/RTeAl0n.jpg - (Lunch / 1562 calories)

* Two tomatoes (44 calories);

* 130g of cheese (286 cal / 17.5g protein);

* 130g of bacon (714 cal / 50.9g protein);

* 65g of processed sausage (277 cal / 14.3g protein);

* 50g of sesame & flax plates (241 cal / 3.7g protein).

Total protein: 86.4g

I always have a big lunch whether I am cutting or whether I am bulking. Skipping breakfast allows me to do this easily regardless and I love having big lunches as they power me through the day. I eat smoked bacon on most days when I bulk because it is the perfect food for bulking and yes it is a hill I am willing to fuckin' die on, don't @ me. >:( **If you aren't eating bacon you are making it so much harder on yourself.** I argued in the past and I will argue again, bacon is the #1 gain food. But no, people will tell me that bacon is bad for you because of the fat content and then they'd be like ""anyway lemme give you one of my shakers recipe where it consists of ONE CUP OF OIL to make it easier to gain"".

Anyway, is 1500 calories a lot? Yes, of course it is. But I ate this, walked for a couple minutes and I didn't feel bloated. You can eat 1000+ calories meals without feeling like you're gonna explode IF you walk it off.

* One banana (108 cal / 27.9g carbs);

* Two honey peaches (117 cal / 28.6g carbs);

* 300g of watermelon (92 cal / 23g carbs);

* 250g of grapes (168 cal / 42.9g carbs).

Total carbs: 122.4g

Yes, that is a lot of fruit and I usually don't eat this much but I had a craving for it before gym so I did it. **That is the whole basis of my diet: if I want to I will do it. I put zero restrictions on myself other than moderation to some degree.**

I always eat fruit regardless about an hour to hour and half before going to the gym, and I always eat a banana regardless of anything else. Banana is a high calorie food with plenty of carbs and you should definitely eat it whether you are bulking or cutting.

(Also, the honey peaches were so damn sweet I just had to take two. I honestly could eat twenty of those in one sitting. They're so damn good.)

https://i.imgur.com/ALS9ACV.jpg?1 - (After Gym / 695 calories)

* One protein shake (280 cal / 33g protein);

* 60g of a mixture of honey, almonds & walnuts (316 cal / 6g protein);

* A few ""cookies"" (not really, pretty healthy) from my country (99 cal / 2.7g protein).

Total protein: 41.7g

I used to take protein with my coffee upon waking up but I realize that, throughout the day, I happen to sometimes overshoot on protein. On some days, I don't even have a protein shake, I can make it up with regular food. I use milk to make my protein shake with one scoop because using water is just god awful and I don't recommend it unless you're lactose intolerant or w/e.

I have one protein shake and that is it. Most of my calories (90%+) come from regular food and stuff.

PS: The small mixture of almonds, honey and walnuts is only worth 316 calories. The recipe is one large freshly squeezed lemon, 400g of honey, 300g of walnuts and 100g of almonds all blended up together. The last time I posted this, people said ""thats a lot of honey"". Yes. Its a lot of honey. You're trying to gain. Shut up, lmao.

https://i.imgur.com/28cKv9b.jpg?1 - (Dinner / 874 calories)

* Stew (approx. 481 cal / 35.3g protein);

* Three boiled eggs (210 cal / 18g protein);

* Buckwheat sticks (183 cal / 6.3g protein)

* A really big hot pepper (idk / 1g protein? - Honestly didn't calculate this because the calories can be so insignificant when it comes to small portions of veggies)

Total protein: 60.6g

As you can see, the majority of protein content for my day comes from lunch & dinner (140ish grams) + the protein shake if I need it. On some days I eat protein heavy lunch and dinner to the point that I don't feel the need to make a protein shake (happens when you are bulking at 3500+ calories and trying not to overshoot on protein).

PS: Yes, that is a hot pepper and, yes, it was really spicy (near the end). I ate it whole tho.. because I really love eating spicy food.

___

**Total Calories & Macros**

* Calories: 3858

* 329g Carbs (34%);

* 198g Fat (46%);

* 199g Protein (20%).

Fat makes up at least 50% of my diet on most days. I don't believe in bulking where carbs make the most of someone's diet because they're less dense per gram. When I bulk, my carbs are about 30 something percent but when I cut they go to about 10 - 20% with fat overtaking it.

**Calories lost**

* From walking & running: 814 calories

* From gym: 488 calories

* Total lost: 1302 calories

Yep. You've read that right. I burned 814 calories through WALKING and running. Now, keep in mind, I only ran for about 10-15 minutes because I was going to be late somewhere. I walked for about hour and something later, so I will put this in big letters.

**IF YOU ARE TRACKING CALORIES, DO NOT FORGET TO TRACK CALORIES BURNED THROUGH WALKING.**

A person can burn an INSANE amount of calories from just walking. Do you know how much I have to walk to burn 550 calories? **One hour and 30 minutes without pause.** Do not underestimate calories burned from walking, just because you aren't panting for air does not mean that walking isn't just destroying your gains. If you have a Samsung, you should have a tracker installed. Keep it on at ALL times and you will see just how much you burn through walking. I am not sure about iPhones, there are some apps called Pedometers which are step calculators (although the Samsung one is really great because it can differentiate between running & walking calories while some pedometers can't).

If you are trying to bulk but you don't know why you are not gaining, it is very worth to check out walking calories.

___

Bulk: 3858 - 2130 (BMR) - 1302 = **426 calories**

As you can see, the bulk with 3858 calories for me only turns about to be approx. 426 calories surplus. As a 6'7"" man who moves a lot and burns a lot, I eat this amount to SLOW bulk.

___

Other food I eat on my bulk: Literally fucking anything. I eat sweets, I do stuff people say not to do yet not only am I bulking but I am able to be normal in social situations without people thinking I am a health nut when they offer me something sweet to eat. You can do this too, if you'd like. You really don't have to be ultra clean as much as you don't have to be ultra dirty, hence why I call it **a stain bulk**. It's not perfect but it is EXTREMELY sustainable and at the end of the day sustainability is the MOST important part when it comes to stuff like this.

Pros: I can eat and drink whatever the fuck I want (except I try to avoid alcohol whenever I can and on the vast majority of days I don't get a sip).

Cons: I have to weigh it, plan stuff out and try my best to be accurate.

The pros outweigh the cons. I use a food scale for everything that I can weigh and the things I can't really weigh (like the stew) I eyeball it approx. and calculate in MyFitnessPal a division of the amount of plates I could get. But I eat whatever I want, really, and I try to find a balance between fun food vs healthy food.",2019-08-22 13:32:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ctxhyt/stain_bulk_example_of_what_i_ate_yesterday_to/

byrc53,gainit,"M24 5'10"" - 155lbs -> 185 lbs -> 170lbs, a bit over 2.5 years progress","First off, photos...https://imgur.com/a/WmSiO3u 

 I started working out after graduating college and spending the summer getting out of shape, the first pic is from Oct 2016. I had been to the gym infrequently throughout undergrad but would usually just run 2-3 miles on a treadmill and fuck around with the dumbbells or machines. I drank often and didn't track meals, ate like shit, etc. 

After starting my first ""real job"" and moving to a new city I went gym to fill the time. I mostly did cardio (running, HIIT), some light compounds, and used the machines for the first 6 months, I put on around 10 lbs before I started researching ways to improve (2nd pic). 

I then went to nSuns 6 day for around 5 months, PHUL, and a few other routines from the Fitness subreddit. I bulked for the next ~1.5 years and eventually reached my heaviest/goal weight of 185lbs, but I still didn't like the way I looked. After that I cut back down to 160, up to 175, down to 160, back to 170. I clearly can't make up my mind/diet self control is not always great.

Currently running J&T 2.0 (~4 days a week) for the second time, I've implemented some cardio a few times a week. I mostly eating intuitively/around maintenance, but I have tried the whole intermittent fasting thing while cutting as a way to help with hunger (not extremely strict, just skipping breakfast).

My current diet is fairly basic but I eat a lot of prepped meals using a slow cooker: chicken thighs, rice, vegetables, pasta, peanut butter, beans, tuna, mac and cheese, overnight oats, tacos, eggs, etc. I have a bit of a sugar issue lately haha but working on curbing it back. Below are my most recent max sets in lbs (I haven't tested 1RM in awhile, but will in a few weeks w/ J&T).  

Current maxs:

* B: 250 x 2
* S: 255 x 5 (lingering hip flexor issue, this is my weakest lift by far)
* D: 395 x 2
* O: 145 x 3 

Overall I'm really satisfied with my progress to date. I would love to get stronger and bump back up to 185 without getting into a dirty bulk, eat everything in sight mindset like my first go at it. I find it very tedious to track calories while bulking so definitely an area I could improve. A huge contributor to my progress was cutting out alcohol almost 9 months ago (shoutout r/stopdrinking), which gives me some room for extra calories from food. 

First time posting so if anyone has anyone questions or if I can make the formatting better let me know! Reading this sub was great motivation when I first started out. Thanks!",2019-06-10 00:39:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/byrc53/m24_510_155lbs_185_lbs_170lbs_a_bit_over_25_years/

bgi6zu,gainit,M/24 // 1.68m / 58kg  63kg / 8 months work in progress and some story in between. First time posting btw,"Hello everyone, I’ve lurked in this sub for a bit and decided to post something here and share my ongoing fitness journey for the first time. To start off, I’m a 24 year old medical student and English is not my native language and would have some difficulty choosing the right words. I started to get into weightlifting and bodybuilding last April of 2012, which was seven years ago. I went to the gym two times a week for a month during the school break. I went back to weightlifting again a year later and also for a month and the next time I went to the gym was two years after that, around June or July 2015, almost four years ago. In between those time periods, I was not very invested into exercise and focused more on school work, watching TV series / youtube videos, or playing videogames. Another excuse why I wasn’t routinely lifting was that the first gym I went to was not a walking distance. They required commuting which took about 20 to 30 minutes or more depending on traffic conditions. By 2014 before returning to lifting for the second time in 2015 with a different gym (which took about two months before it got closed down and it’s even near to where I live so it’s a walking distance away), I discovered Darebee’s website on bodyweight fitness as a substitute for weightlifting at least three times a week, even though I didn’t gain as much as going to gym and lifting weights, and I’ve been routinely doing body weight exercises for about four years until my third return to the gym.

&#x200B;

By August 2018, I’ve moved to a different area because the med school I’m currently studying at is far away from home, which can take at least one hour of travel time. For me, having moved is a big convenience since I only have to walk from the condo building to school. Another convenience that I’ll add is that the building I’m staying at has a gym, which means to say that there’s no excuse for me being lazy as the gym is just one elevator ride. So then I decided to start lifting weights again and I’ve been doing so for almost nine months with more emphasis on compound lifts particularly squats, bench presses, and deadlifts. I go there three to four times a week. And then last December, I started to add cardio days at least once a week. Then a month later, I started trying out intermittent fasting as I’m also attempting to lose fat in the midsection. In short, I’m currently attempting to gain more muscle mass and at the same time lose fat, more specifically, trying to get well defined abs.

&#x200B;

Also, some history and something personal if you guys don’t mind and it may or may not be relevant to the sub, but it’s one of those things that motivated me in pursuing my fitness goals. Tracing back when I was in elementary school, I was not into sports and grew up thin and underweight up until 17 years old. I was a target of bullying (mostly name calling) until the end of high school, most probably because I was quiet, shy, thin, and not into sports. It affected my social skills and self-esteem. By the time I started college, my self-worth went down as I see other guys who are more fit, athletic, and good-looking are more liked, more respected, and more approachable. I envy those guys so I decided to do something for myself. Even now I still have those feelings of envy and comparing myself with better and fitter looking people. I ask myself questions such as “when will I get there?”, “how much more effort do I need to put in?”, “how much more weight do I need to lift?”, or “how long would it take me to look like that?” There are days where I’m struggling with the patience aspect of gaining more muscle and the only answer to those questions would be to keep doing what I’m doing.

&#x200B;

Progress wise, I started out at approximately 128  lb (58 kg) last August 2018 and by this time, I currently weigh 139 lb (63 kg). My height is 5 ft. 6 in. (1.68m)

&#x200B;

My lifting / exercise schedule:

Mondays , Wednesdays, Saturdays: Compound lifts

1. Squats\* : 3 x 10 to 12 (current max - 260 lb)
2. Bench\*\* : 5 x 5 (current max - 97 lb @ <5 rep)
3. Deadlift\*\* : 3 x 5 (+ 1)  (warm up sets, 119 lb); 2 x 2 (working sets, 163 lb)

&#x200B;

Thursday : Shoulders, lats, arms, traps

1. Shoulder press (dumbbells) : 3 x 8 to 10 (warm up sets, 30 lb); 3 x 5 (+1) (working sets, 35 lb)
2. Seated Bent-Over Rear Delt Raise : 3 x 10 (warm up sets, 10 lb); 3 x 8 (+2) (working sets, 15 lb)
3. Lat pull downs : 3 x 10 (warm up sets); 3 x 5 to 10 (working sets, current max - 110 lb)
4. Hammer curls : 3 x 10 (warm up sets, 15 lb); 3 x 5 (+1) (working sets, current max - 20 lb)
5. Dumbbell kickback : 3 x 10 (warm up sets, 15 lb); 3 x 5 (+1) (working sets, current max - 20 lb)
6. Triceps push down :  3 x 10 (warm up sets); 3 x 5 to 10 (working sets, current max - 80 lb)
7. Barbell plate shrugs : 3 x 10

&#x200B;

On lifting days, I usually start with: Pull ups : 3 x 5 or 6

And then end my lifting sessions with working on abs and calves :

1. Leg raises : 3 x 10 to 15
2. Side bends (w/ barbell plate or dumbbell) : 3 x 10 (one side and then to the opposite)
3. Calf raise\* : 3 x 10 to 12 (current max - 220 lb)

&#x200B;

For the first few months my workouts were half compound lifts and half isolation exercises. By mid October, I focused more on compound lifts and then by April, I started adding ab exercises, as I wanted to improve the look of my midsection.

&#x200B;

\* Squat and calf raise were done on the leg press machine since the gym that I go to doesn’t have a squat rack

\*\* Bench press and deadlift weight includes barbell weight

&#x200B;

Tuesdays, Fridays, Sundays : Rest day or cardio day

&#x200B;

As for diet, my meals consist of chicken, fish, salad, white rice, eggs, and bread. Sometimes I eat snacks in between meals. I also drink protein shake consisting of apple, banana, oats, and one to two scoops of whey as post workout drink on lifting days. On non-lifting days is where would I fast for at least 16 hours starting from dinner (Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays) a few minutes before 6 pm and then my next meal would be around 10 am to 12 noon on the next day. I don’t really measure my calories because I find it tedious and don’t have a lot of free time prepping meals for the next day. I often eat out with my group of friends for lunch nearly on a daily basis on school days from Mondays to Fridays. The only thing I measured was my  [TDEE](https://imgur.com/a/7y7pVyc) and that’s pretty much it.

&#x200B;

[Work in progress pic](https://imgur.com/a/n5nENZZ). It probably looks like there's not much progress, but I'm aware that my arms have some increase in size and my chest is becoming a bit harder.

&#x200B;

Body fat percentage is I guess around 18 - 20% as I don’t have those calipers and don’t know where to buy one (I don’t live in the US or Europe btw)

&#x200B;

TLDR / To sum this up, I’ve lifted weights on and off from 2012 - 2015 and relied on bodyweight exercises from 2014 until August last year. I’ve been lifting consistently for three to four times a week since that time and started doing some cardio last December and I.F. last January. I’ve been making some small progress and I still think I have a long way to go.

I hate to make this another, should I cut or bulk thread, but I’m so confused about what to do. 

I lost a lot of weight when I was younger, but through a lot of cardio and calorie restriction, which is why I believe that I ended up skinny fat, i.e. without much muscle. 

**Food**

I'm a fan of intermittent fasting since it allows to feel full, even with low calories on a rest day.

Right now, I calorie cycle, which means I have more food on my 3 training days, but am still in a deficit throughout the week.

* Training: 2114 calories (211g protein, 238g carbs, 35g fat)
* Rest: 1239 calories (170g protein, 22g carbs, 52g fat)

**Current routine:**

On RPT, and below are my latest numbers for the big lifts. 

Deadlift: 255x6, 230 x8

Bench Press: 160x7, 145x8, 135x9

Squat: 170 x 10, 155 x12, 140 x16

&#x200B;

**The inevitable bulk or cut question**

Should I continue lifting heavy in a deficit until my stubborn belly fat and love handles disappear? if so, for how many pounds?

Or....

Should I make the jump and commit to a lean bulk to 5-6 months with a progressive overload program such as PHAT or PHUL?  

**My main fear is that my BF% is too high to lean bulk, and I'll end up getting fatter without adding much muscle.**

Today I realized I could be making a huge mistake with my caloric intake. I am currently doing intermittent fasting and eating around 2200 calories in a day, which seems to be a slight surplus based on some online calculators iv hesitantly trusted. But to the best of my ability I think I am only getting around 120 grams of protein on my best day, which is including 2 scoops of protein powder after the gym and about 80 grams between breakfast, dinner and snacks. Today I did more research trying to see if I could improve my development and ran into a ton of articles saying that I should be eating at least 180g. 

Is there a definitive calculator for finding protein intake? And have I been slowly screwing myself out of gains for 5 months!? lol

For the past months I've done 50 % carbs, 30 % proteins and 20 % fat. I noticed changes in less than a month, I was toning a lot and losing fat. However, since the first or second day I started having bowel problems, at the beginning it was just super stinky farts when I ate proteins but then I felt like kinda constipated but not really. Since then, I've been gradually constipating until the point where I couldn't poop at all. Never had I had bowel problems before tracking this set of macros. So I've decided that I can't take it anymore, I feel bloated all the time, like there's shit stuck in my intestines that will never come out. I tried metamucil, fiber gums, tons of water, upping my natural fiber intake (I was eating like 69 g of fiber a day) and nothing worked. At the moment, I'm cleaning my intestines with intermittent fasting for two days. Then I will decrease the amount of protein intake because it seems my body doesn't tolerate too much of it. So, I was thinking of moving to the 50/25/25 ratio, or the 50/30 fat /20 protein ratio; but I'm unsure because I don't want to lose my progress or gain fat or whatever. Has anyone had good results with these ratios? What's your opinion about it? thanks for your moment and thanks in advance for your comments.

PS: Sorry for my English.

\-  
TL;DR: 50/30/20 had me constipated AF for month, so I'm switching to other ratio but I'm unsure about which one. Don't wanna lose progress or gain fat.",2019-03-12 02:32:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/b02dx6/ditching_503020_constipated_af_whats_your_opinion/

a2bw1y,gainit,Important hormones for building muscle and tips on how to improve them,"For those of you who seem to struggle with gaining muscle and just get fat instead, or if you're one of those people who just struggle to gain any weight at all, I trust that this post can be of some help to you.

First and foremost I'll be discussing the thyroid as your thyroid is extremely important for muscle growth...

&#x200B;

# Thyroid

Thyroid hormones increase and activate satellite cells in the muscles, increase myogenic (muscle growth) factors, lower myostatin (a negative regulator of muscle growth), convert slow twitch muscle fibers to fast twitch muscle fibers, increase steroidogenesis, increase cortisol excretion from the body, increase follistatin (positive regulator of muscle growth), increase IGF-1 levels and IGF-1 availability, and also increase the metabolic rate. 

So as you can tell, thyroid function and thyroid hormones are crucial for anabolism.

**Things that inhibit thyroid function** are nutritional deficiencies, inflammation, gut-irritating foods (increase inflammation, endotoxins, prolactin, estrogen and serotonin which are all thyroid antagonists), serotonin, cortisol, insufficient calories and carbs, polyunsaturated fat, overtraining, chronic stress, etc. 

**Easy ways to boost thyroid function** is to lower stress by taking a break from stressful situations (e.g. going for a walk, taking time to relax etc.), boosting dopamine and GABA, avoiding gut-irritating foods, getting lots of sunlight, consuming all your vitamins and minerals.

A few diet tips for promoting thyroid function is to eat easily digestible foods, consume calcium-rich foods, consume gelatin via bone broth or supplement (glycine is highly anti-inflammatory and lowers cortisol), eat more carbs than protein, keep PUFA intake as low as possible and try to avoid empty calories (as they use up the body's nutrients to be processed but don't provide the body with any nutrients of their own).

&#x200B;

# Cortisol

Cortisol is a significant negative regulator of muscle growth. It decreases thyroid function and thyroid hormone conversion, lowers IGF-1, increases myostatin and proteolysis (muscle breakdown), induces insulin resistance, inhibits steroidogenesis, increases the aromatase and inhibits muscle protein synthesis.

Cortisol is elevated when thyroid hormones are reduced as well as during inflammation, stress, etc. 

Trenbolone, which is one of the most potent anabolic steroids, is a very potent inhibitor of the cortisol receptor. Actually, cortisol receptors are several fold higher in the muscle compared to androgen receptors, thus blocking the cortisol receptor or lowering cortisol levels have a very anabolic effect on the muscle.

**Things that increase cortisol** is low blood sugar, overexertion, training past fatigue and failure, long distance running, too much HIIT, low carb diet, inflammation, polyunsaturated fat, etc.

**Things you can do to keep cortisol in check** is to eat a low polyunsaturated diet (PUFAs cause inflammation and I personally found my DOMS are significantly less and my cortisol is much lower when my PUFA intake is low), eat lots of carbs, avoid long workouts, use supplements that lower cortisol, such as glycine, taurine, ornithine, PS, vit D, magnesium, etc.

&#x200B;

# Follistatin & Myostatin

As mentioned above, myostatin reduces anabolism and increases fat mass, whereas follistatin reduces myostatin, boosts muscle growth and lowers fat mass. Fertilized eggs are a great source of follistatin; that's one reason Vince Gironda advised to eat 2 dozen raw eggs daily.

**A few things that decrease** **myostatin and increase follistatin** are creatine, caffeine,  Epichatechin (found in cocoa), testosterone, vitamin D, vit A, vit E, glycine, taurine, thyroid, etc.

Endotoxins, inflammation, cortisol, etc, increase myostatin and lowers follistatin.

So the point I'm trying to make is that anything that slows the metabolism, inhibits thyroid function and increases cortisol will negatively affect muscle growth.

&#x200B;

# IGF-1

Growth hormone actually increases myostatin gene expression, but IGF-1 overrides myostatin. So you don't want elevated GH, but elevated IGF-1. However, boosting GH to increase IGF-1 isn't a good idea, in my opinion, and IGF-1 won't necessarily increase due to higher levels of GH.

IGF-1 significantly increases muscle growth as it stimulates satellite cells, increases glucose and amino transport into the muscles, lowers inflammation, etc.

IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) prolongs the circulation and biological action of IGF-1, which stimulates muscle hypertrophy. IGFBP-3 and IGF-1 are significantly elevated post workout and are observed to stimulate protein synthesis and subsequently muscle hypertrophy. In fact, IGFBP-3 has been shown to have a significant and direct effect on muscle cell growth, even without the presence of IGF-1.

We want both IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 elevated (balanced) because a low IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratio is associated with increased waist-to-hip ratio, but a high IGF-1:IGFBP-3 ratio is associated with baldness, cancer and other diseases.

**Things that increase IGF-1 are DHEA** are vitamin D, vit A, protein, milk, calcium, magnesium, zinc, exercise, egg yolks, potassium, taurine, etc.

**Things that** **increase IGFBP-3** is magnesium, vitamin A, vit B6, zinc, copper, HIIT, etc.

**Things that** **decrease IGF-1** is inflammation, cortisol, intermittent fasting, etc.

**Things that decrease IGFBP-3** is estrogen, inflammation, overtraining (increase cortisol to testosterone ratio), endotoxins, etc.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

So to take it all together. Thyroid function is really crucial for muscle growth. To further potentiate hypertrophy and strength gains lowering cortisol and boosting follistatin and IGF-1 would be most important. Androgens are also very important, but increasing the number of androgen receptors as well as their sensitivity is more important.",2018-12-02 09:14:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/a2bw1y/important_hormones_for_building_muscle_and_tips/

87psxo,gainit,"[Progress] What 300 days of lifting got me. [32/M/6'1""/155-185+/2 years]","[Progress album here.](https://imgur.com/a/RKYad) I've been as low as 139 in my college years, but for most of my adult life I've hovered around 160, usually below.

I started SL5x5 from nothing in February 2016. March 19, 2018 marked my 300th official workout on some form of progressive lifting program. I figured that was as good a milestone as any to finally share my progress with the subreddit that started me on this life-changing journey.
***
**Routine and lifts**

My current routine is a [double progression RPT scheme](https://leangains.com/reverse-pyramid-training-guide/) modeled after the /r/leangains [programs]( https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/6khdst/summary_of_new_clients_training_program_compared/) with borrowed influences from GSLP and 5/3/1. I started incorporating a lot more chest work because it's by far my weakest muscle group (I blame the lack of a proper bench station at my gym). I would also like to try to achieve a more noticeable V-taper before my summer cut, so I recently added lat pulldowns and eventually will fit in pec deck flies somewhere.

Sample week + current working sets (weights are in lbs):

Day 1

* (stupid fucking smith machine) Bench - 180 x 6, 170 x 8, 160 x 8
* Bent-over Rows - 185 x 8, 175 x 9, 167.5 x 10
* Squat - 215 x 10 reps x 5 sets (boring sets like 5/3/1)
* Skullcrushers (Accessory) - 11 x 80, 72.5 x 14, 65 x 15
    
Day 2

* OHP - 125 x 6, 117.5 x 7, 112.5 x 8
* Deadlift - 325 x 6, 290 x 8, 265 x 9
* Barbell Curls - 80 x 7, 70 x 10, 65 x 11
* Weighted Dips (Accessory) - +40 x 9, +17.5 x 13, BW x 15
    
Day 3

* Incline DB Bench - 70s x 7, 65s x 9, 60s x 11
* Weighted Chinup - +55 x 9, +30 x 11, +10 x 13
* Squat - 280 x 8, 252.5 x 10, 227.5 x 12
* Machine Calf Raise (Accessory) - 160 x 15, 145 x 16
* Lat Pulldowns (Accesory) - 3-5 sets in 8-12 rep range, still figuring out a good weight
    
OHP and Benches alternate like Phrak's GSLP. All other main lifts stay on their day. One can easily add 4th or 5th RPT sets for additional volume on any lift that needs it. Accessories can be shuffled around as desired.

Tested training maxes (from February 2018 while on 5/3/1):

* (stupid fucking smith machine) Bench - 205 x 2
* Squat - 320 x 2
* Dead - 345 x 3
* OHP - 142.5 x 2

***
**Diet**


My TDEE is somewhere around 2800-3000 (""moderate exercise 5 days/week""). I don't count calories. This should be obvious from the modest progress in my pictures.

I can't emphasize this enough: **Track and count your calories.** *Do not be like me.* You can get far better results in a shorter amount of time. Just look at the progress posts of people who do lift hard while religiously maintaining a 500 calorie surplus. I've done what I was comfortable with and fits into my daily routine - and these are the results I have to show for it. I'm fairly pleased with the improvements I've made, especially in regards to strength, but I would never try to convince someone else that I am the example that they should follow. ""Do as I say, not as I do.""

I do track my protein macro. I aim for 0.8g per lb of bodyweight. I usually hit it. I take 5g of Creatine a day, and probably will for the rest of my life.

When and if I cut, I do 18/6 intermittent fasting. Skip breakfast (drink black coffee to suppress appetite), workout at 12, eat a large lunch at 2, stop eating before 8 pm. Like many people, I retain my stubborn fat around my midsection. I've had some success with Yohimbine HCL for visible abs during a cut.
***
**Parting Thoughts**

Having been weak all my life up until when I started lifting, this [famous Socrates quote](https://i.imgur.com/PFLiQVG.png) really resonates with me.

Then, the [Arnold (or Ashley Horner? attribution is unclear)](https://i.redd.it/l6w6o2q0mccx.jpg) quote is what really articulated how I felt when I started recognizing the results of all the hard work that I had put in, and perhaps more importantly, the hard work of *everyone else* who has made fitness a serious priority in their lives.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxF7d39ak7Q

http://imgur.com/mWSARGN

HEY EVERYONE!
Just as a lot of others out there I bulk after a time of being lean in order to gain strenght and muscle mass. But I guess that I got pretty fat this time... So I decided to join a 90 day transformation challenge, and document it for others to show that we are able to make big differences on a short period of time, if we give it 100%. 
I lost 24lbs during this cut. 189lbs > 165. (probably lost a bit more fat, but I were starting a new creatine cycle (water retention) during the second month). Btw I'm 5'10''.

DIET: 
I used intermittent fasting combined with flexible dieting. 
""16:8 ish"" - So I would wake up and have my black coffee to suppress my hunger and then drink a lot of water to fill up before I could eat around 12-14:00. This helped me to burn a bit extra more fat and also being able to hit larger meals due to the smaller time period I were allowed to eat. 
FLEXIBLE DIETING: I ate whatever I wanted as long as I hit my macro nutrients: 180Protein 126Carbs 50Fats.

My favorite and most helpful food during this cut were oatmeal, about 30-40 min before the training session combined with caffeine... it helped me to stay focused and strong during the first two months of cutting. 
I used a 700kcal deficit to be able to burn pretty much fat and yet not collapse in the gym. 
During my last weeks of cutting I had a daily caloric intake of 1660. That was the hardest part of the dieting... 

TRAINING:
I didn't change much during this period, just lowered the general weekly training volume to be able to recover and maintain my strenght as good as I could... (reduced the sets/reps). 

I did a Pull, Push, Legs routine. 
I think that it's the most optimal way to train if you are a natural. Its important to hit your muscle groups more often if you want to be able to stimulate protein synthesis. I hit all of my muscle groups twice per week. 
I recommend to train 3 days in a row and then take one day off and then repeat. 

I started with my main lifts (compound movements) like bench press / squats in the beginning of my workouts. 
5x5 and then I choose a pair of extra exercises for hypertrophy 3x12. 

I have never gotten this result before after cutting and I really recommend that you guys track your macros when cutting, it helped me so much. So here comes my 90 day documentation video, it were made to inspire and motivate others to fight for their goals.

Hey guys,

My friend's not familiar with Reddit but he's made some gains that I think you guys would appreciate, so I thought I would post for him. My friend Kelvin recently went through a fitness journey and thought you guys would appreciate it. I got his full consent to post this link and all of the following information. Some background on him: he's 5'10 and currently 23 years old. When he started his fitness journey he was around 155 pounds, then went down to about 150 pounds, then up to around 160 pounds at the end.

His philosophy was to try a more minimalistic approach to the whole fitness thing and surprisingly got results faster and more effortlessly than ever before.

Workout/diet routine:
He worked out 3 times a week and my split was chest, triceps, legs and back, biceps and shoulders. 

He did a hybrid training style incorporating both weight training and body weight training with reverse pyramid training on my big lifts. 

He started out with easier variations but towards the end some of the exercises he did in my routine include incline bench press, one arm push ups, weighted pull ups, muscle ups...etc

For nutrition he did intermittent fasting - eating 2 meals a day. Generally one around 2-3ish and 7ish. He estimated his calories.

The video provides more details of his journey and some of the workout exercises he did. 

I hope this video and story inspires you to take action and start. ",2017-05-13 18:48:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/6azg9c/progress_this_is_a_15_year_natural_transformation/

[1 year and 4 months](http://imgur.com/a/HS5sK)

&nbsp;

**Video**

If you would like to look a bit more into this transformation check out this video i made.

[Transformation Video](https://youtu.be/aB9y-MMNdMU)

&nbsp;

**Overview**

I have now been training for about 1 year and 4 months. The first 4 months I dedicated myself to cutting and losing fat. During this period I went from 81kgs (179lbs) to 71kgs (156lbs). For the next year I began bulking and in this time I go from 71kgs (156lbs) to 82kgs (181lbs). I will continue to bulk for another year before I do any major cut.

&nbsp;

**Lifting Stats**

Bench Press - 130kgs (290lbs)

Squats - 130kgs x 5

Deadlifts - 180kgs (405lbs)

Overhead Press - 70kgs (155lbs) x 5

&nbsp;

For my squat and overhead press I have never test my 1 rep max, so i put my 5 rep max.

&nbsp;

**Diet**

I used MyFitnessPal to track my calories and macros. I used the app to determine how many calories I needed to intake for my cut, which was around 1500kcal. During the cut I always made sure I was getting enough protein. I would try to eat atleast 120grams of protein per day. Carbs didn't really matter because there weren't enough calories to go around anyways. About 1 month in I started doing intermittent fasting, which is basically having a certain window frame to eat.

My bulk I used MyFitnessPal less as after using it for so long, I could estimate my calories and macros. I was eating anywhere between 3500 - 4500kcal a day. During the bulk I upped my protein to 180grams per day.

&nbsp;

**Training**

The first 4 months of training, I worked out 5 times a week, on a PPL variation. 

Chest/Tricep x 2

Back/Bicep x 2

Legs/Shoulders x 1

I kept my reps above 8 for all exercises as my priority at this point was muscle.

&nbsp;

When I transitioned into my bulk, I added an extra Legs/Shoulder day. I also added a 5x5 lift to each day. So for example on chest days I did flat bench for 5x5 and increased the weight every workout. I did this for squats and deadlifts as well. My strength jumped so quickly for bench and within 2 months I was lifting 100kgs (225lbs) for 5x5. 

I am currently still doing PPL 6 days a week, however I increase my reps to 8+, as right now my primary focus is mass.

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

I'm very lucky that before I even started working out, I was already watching Youtube videos, reading articles about working out and dieting, so when I started I had a little head start.

I would make sure when you workout to have a well thought out plan and by this I mean, having a good program for your goals, whether is be for strength, aesthetics or mass. Having the right rep ranges and also having a progression scheme. 

I think once you understand the basics it becomes so simple, its almost common sense.

If I want to continue IF should I arrange so that my eating window ends before I go to bed or is the importance on timing protein consumption sometimes exaggerated?",2017-03-02 03:49:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/5x0zik/presleep_nutrition_vs_intermittent_fasting/

5qblqx,gainit,Intermittent fasting & bulking (my results),"Just wanted to put this out there for anyone considering bulking using IF.

**Background:** I've been intermittent fasting the last 3 years & started my most recent bulk 1 month ago.

**Stats:** 5'11"" / 27 / M / 175 (+3 lbs in past 1 month) / Full body split (bench day / squat day / deadlift day) 2 on/1 off

**Benefits of intermittent fasting for bulking**
- More convenient to eat 3 big meals (for my schedule)
- Easier on my stomach (never feel like I'm stuffing myself)
- Potential hormonal benefits (raised HGH and insulin sensitivity)

**Drawbacks of intermittent fasting for bulking**
- Harder to eat all of my calories between 12pm and 8pm
- Some days I'm busy and have to ""break"" my eating window or stretch it a little
- Potentially lower muscle protein synthesis vs. 5-6 protein feedings per day

**Conclusion**
The #1 reason I do IF is because it makes my stomach feel better and increases my appetite. If I were a normal dude who didn't get an upset stomach when I eat late at night, then I would NOT use IF while I'm bulking.

Also, I just put up a short YouTube video going deeper into my personal results using IF. Click here if you want to check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfd2F9-2RNo

I'm curious what you guys have experienced in terms of IF and bulking?",2017-01-26 17:47:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/5qblqx/intermittent_fasting_bulking_my_results/

Eating healthy is not a problem as I eat all whole foods and cook every meal at home, but it's just not enough to support muscular growth.

I tell myself I will start eating more, but I tend to enjoy intermittent fasting mostly during the day and eating once I'm finally sitting down and can enjoy my food at night. I have a high activity level keeping up with a 3 year old and working out as i move around all day too.

It's been hard to devote as much time lifting I used to, but can still fit in at least 2 or 3 days of compound lifts each week. If I were to finally increase my calories now even though my frequency is lower, should I expect to still see muscle growth? Anyone else do something like this before and notice they actually got stronger?

I'm 17, 64.5kg and 5'9"" and looking to bulk up. Doing a five day split which I am enjoying a lot, and doing the 30 Day Ab Challenge Advanced Level 1 each day alongside 100 press ups in the morning. Enough with my exercise, to the topic at hand.

I'm wanting to build my body naturally, with as few supplements as possible (I take 3 l-glutamine tablets after my workout and that is currently it, as well as a few multivitamins - can increase this if needed and *maybe* get some powder if my parents allow it, they think it is a total waste of money). Someone at the gym who I get on with well was saying I need to go buy BCAAs and tubs of l-glutamine to meet my needs to start bulking up as while I am quite lean, I am not big as such. Being a student, buying all of this would seriously hit my very limited finances, as I do not have a steady job with work only coming around seasonally most of the time. My parents, however, are happy to pay for any shopping (not going overboard) I do and let me cook my own meals. Which brings me onto my question...

What are some quick to prepare meals (if possible that I can make in large batches and refrigerate / freeze) that use only a few ingredients that will meet all the nutritional and macros that I require for the day. I am doing Intermittent Fasting 95% of the time, but have a voracious appetite so I can wolf down a lot of food in one sitting, so two - three meals in an eight hour window is not much trouble, providing I eat things that contain what I need in the right quantities. I have looked at fat/carb/protein split, which I think 20/50/30 is good, and all that but creating two - three meals that I can eat cold or heat up after preparation is hurting my head. I don't think that any more information is necessary, but if you need to ask to give a better helpful answer, please do!

With Ramadan (16hrs no water no food) coming up, I'd like to lay out my macronutrients in a way that I'm properly fed to train during at the end of my ""feeding window"".

Normally I ramp my carbs UP and fats DOWN during the day with most of my carbs after training. Would following a similar tactic be wise/effective when trying to maintain weight during Ramadan?

I find that breaking my fast with too many carbs makes me really lethargic. Any hints as to how I could remedy that?

1mtyskf,loseit,Quitting snacks cold turkey or trying healthy swaps?,"I used to graze all day. I lost weight calorie counting and intermittent fasting. From this experience, I know I do my best eating two meals plus one reasonable snack per day, and want to try maintaining or even losing a little more without tracking, just sticking to the foods that I ate to lose weight when I was tracking. Easier said than done, sure. I’ve taken breaks from tracking in the past and have gotten back to it when I am ready, and I just am not ready right now.

Problem: without tracking, my snacking habit is coming back. IF has made it easier to resist snacking between breakfast and lunch (or, now, just snacking before lunch) and snacking after dinner. But once I have lunch, I just want to snack (on empty calories) alllll afternoon while I’m at work, but I KNOW I can’t do it and still lose weight.

I’m not one of those people who thinks they can’t change. I know it’s possible for me to stop snacking. I managed it when I was tracking and I know I can do it again, I just want to do it without tracking. My question is this: for those of you who have overcome a snacking habit that was interfering with your goals, did you stop cold turkey, or switch to very low calorie snacks, like fresh veggies? I love fresh veggies, my only concern is this swap isn’t really breaking the habit and will open the door to continuing to eating lots of snack calories",2025-08-18 21:15:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mtyskf/quitting_snacks_cold_turkey_or_trying_healthy/

For me it’s a bit deep, but unaliving myself never felt like an option to me because I knew in the process I would be unaliving my mom who has also been my number 1 fan and in a deep chat on the 30th of March a friend told me that the way I was treating my body was effectively doing the same as there was a good chance she would be alive to lose me, that was it for me I couldn’t carry on like that.

The biggest thing that helped me was actively changing the way I thought about food, it used to be a fun pastime for me, I enjoyed eating more than most things, so I started intermittent fasting, it meant that I could still eat (somewhat) what I wanted at 7pm every night but with that I had to sacrifice my other meals.

But after all of that, 2 days ago I ran my first 10k and although it’s not a competitive time it’s the biggest accomplishment of my life so far, 6 months ago if someone had told me to walk 10km I would have laughed in their face, I want whoever is reading this to realise I wasn’t someone who let myself go, I was never active and didn’t want to be, I didn’t want to stop eating the way I used to, but I did, and if you can’t bring yourself to do it for yourself I understand, but there is someone in this world who loves you and doesn’t want to lose you, and if you don’t think there is that changes today because I love you and I think the world is actively a better place with you in it, I’ve got a long way to go but if I can do it anyone can.",2025-08-17 14:53:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1msszrk/new_here/

I started losing weight on June 24th this year at 186.6 kg (411 lbs) and I’m now down to 171 kg (377 lbs). I’m 172 cm (5’7.5”), male.

I’ve never been slim, but things really got out of control since the first COVID lockdowns – my weight just kept creeping up. Now I want to get below 100 kg before my health takes permanent damage. My goal is to lose about 1 kg (\~2 lbs) per week and keep as much muscle as possible.

What I’m doing right now:

* Intermittent fasting 16:8 – eating window around 8 hours
* Calories most days: \~1,200–1,300
* One refeed day a week (maintenance or a bit over)
* Macros: aiming for 100–120 g protein, moderate fat, carbs depending on mood/activity
* Activity: pretty minimal, just daily movement, no structured workouts
* Often not that hungry and sometimes end up well below my calorie target without planning to

Yesterday’s food (10.08.2025):

* 11:35 – 100 g salmon, 5 eggs, chives (\~670 kcal, 59 g protein, 43 g fat, 5 g carbs)
* 16:10 – 150 g Skyr (raspberry) (\~105 kcal, 15 g protein, 1 g fat, 8 g carbs)
* 19:05 – 250 g cottage cheese, 160 g canned tuna (\~370 kcal, 71 g protein, 5 g fat, 4 g carbs)
* Total: \~1,145 kcal, 145 g protein, 49 g fat, 17 g carbs

What I’m wondering: 

1. Is this too low in calories for my current size, even if my protein is high?
2. Any obvious red flags in how I’ve set things up?
3. Should I be pushing to hit my calorie goal more consistently for long-term success?

I used ChatGPT to help me write this post because of the language Barrier (native German).. sorry if some parts sound a bit “AI-polished”.

1mmpehj,loseit,"After losing 60lbs in 14 months, here are 5 things I wish I knew when I started.","Hey ya'll, this sub is such an encouraging place, so I figured I'd drop the lessons I've learned along the way, and hope I can inspire atleast one person with this post!

When I started, I wasn’t athletic at all. I thought running a mile was impossible. Losing the weight changed everything. It showed me that if you stick to the basics and stay consistent, you can do anything you set your mind to. I’ve now run 2 marathons because of that lesson alone.

Here are 5 things I wish I knew from day one:

1. **Don’t try to go from A to C:** Most people start following someone’s “final form” routine or diet. If you’re trying to go from A to B, you don’t need the strictest diet on earth. You need to master the basics first.
2. **Any diet works if you can stick to it:** Low carb, keto, intermittent fasting… they can all work, but only if you can actually live with them long term. Pick something you can see yourself doing a year from now.
3. **Progress isn’t always visible:** The scale will stall, your body will look the same some weeks, but inside your habits are improving. Those “invisible wins” matter more than you think.
4. **Your environment matters:** If your kitchen is full of junk food, your willpower won’t save you forever. Set yourself up to win by making the easy choice the right choice.
5. **Start smaller than you think:** Don’t try to run every day or cut all sugar at once. Start with one daily walk, one healthier meal, or tracking your food. Small wins snowball into massive change.

If you’re reading this and you’re stuck, please remember that you're so strong for already putting in the work, and progress takes time!

Luckily my husband cooks because I hate doing it, and we have switched to whole wheat pasta (for when we eat pasta) and he usually makes some kind of chicken or lean beef situation. 

Again, sweets are my kryptonite and I’ll get a craving for chocolate at night and then end up devouring an entire thing of brownies from the store. It’s not every night by any means, but on average about twice a week I give into the sweet cravings.

i am trying to make a meal plan bc i know that if i dont plan my meals i tend to skip meals and then overeat on junk food and generally make poor food decisions which are calorically dense and unhealthy. but alone planning the meals is so much effort - it has to be low enough calorie for a deficit bc its the only way to lose weight (i know) - i cant really count calories bc its not healthy for me and a slippery slope into old habits, but not only do those meals have to calorically okay but also balanced on macros including high protein, high fiber, healthy fats (and maybe carbs) and micronutrients from fruit and vegetables. i am vegan for environmental and ethical reasons so that makes it even harder.

so planning meals that are macro balanced, vegan, have fiber and also taste decent enough (bc if they are not at least somewhat tasty i will binge). i will binge if they arent balanced enough. i will binge if they are just macros no taste. i will binge if i do intermittent fasting - i can fast thats not the problem, the problem is not binging after fasting, and i know from experience regular, balanced smaller meals help with my binging urges instead of omad or 2 bigger meals.

i know meal prep is a great tool and i am down for doing it - i just have a hard time from the logistical standpoint, my kitchen is tiny as well as my fridge so prepping a lot and storing it is v much a struggle. if i prepped meals for the whole week on sunday i think some textural issues would occur maybe - i have had that experience. i thought about prepping breakfast for the whole week and just making 2 portions of dinner and taking one for lunch the next day - which i think is the most realistic thing for me in terms of storage. the time after work is limited tho so quick meals but that part would be fine.

i also have to say sometimes i would realistically and lets be honest i need to be realistic and honest and cant just say that i will adhere to some perfect plan bc that will never work - realistically my friends will ask me out after work to do smth then my perfect dinner cooking and lunch plan falls away and i would have to improvise for lunch which could easily end in some junk food option. while you might say just plan only social events on weekends - my friends have very different work schedules so sometimes the only time would be during the week and i cant sacrifice my social life so much bc i need it to stay sane and keep of the depression (which could lead to more binging). on top of that i am a people pleaser to saying no is not a strength of mine.

and then how do you fit in sleep. if i wanna go to the gym 4x per week for 45 min which is realisitc for results i would have to go before work - my work starts at 8 am the gym opens at 6 am. nearly all gyms in my area do that. i also know i can realistically wake up long term before 5 am bc i will not get to bed early enough to get enough sleep and we all know how important sleep is for weight loss and health. so i calculated - waking up at 5 am, packing for the gym and day and getting ready, walking to the gym (20 min) to be there at 6 am. train for 45 min (and like 15 min buffer time) - 7 am get ready in the gym (shower/refresh, etc.) for work and leave at 7:20 am to walk to the gym (yes i could take public transportation which would take me 15 min instead of 40 but i need to get in my steps and i have to get to work so i wont skip them. i also wont hit the gym after work bc my discipline is lower than and also it way too packed and i have a sponateous social life. so work, adding in a lucnh walk (30min), ideally walking home for 1 h (i end at 4pm) - to hit 20k steps for the day and adding in 4x cardio a week after work for 45 min. then having to cook, stretch bc its also important, keep my apartement clean, beauty routines (hair, skin, etc care) and it easily 9 pm again. that  leaves very little time for buffers - i planned it in realistic time slots.

yeah so i could say yes to a friend meet and then do my cardio session on one of my rest days and take that day as a spontaneous rest day thats not the problem.

i just think you have to hit so many things for it to be a realistic sustainable healthy weight loss - bc just starve is so easy (not always easy in terms of hunger or energy) but easy in terms of you dont need to make time or exercise or cooking healthy as long as its as little calories as possible. i miss the simplicity. like i feel like the bare minimum is already taking up so much time and mental effort and i dont want to make working out and weight loss my whole identity and my only hobby bc its detrimental to my mental health and relationships

i also want to include other hobbies like sewing, reading, movies, painting, etc. but idk when to schedule them except maybe a bit on the weekend. yk. i just wanna know how people do it all without having no life at all or feeling so overwhelmed. if you think its only excuses you can tell but give me actionable tips and not just shaming. idk i need to vent but i also need some tips on how to actually achieve a healthy life and healthy weight loss in a sustainable way.",2025-08-08 09:00:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mkq6wn/how_do_yall_balance_it_all/

I’ve always been on the slimmer side and used to be really active as a kid but after puberty my activity went down and metabolism slowed down like crazy so I can say I'm not that fit plus was anemic for many years (not anymore) 

Just got done with uni three months ago and I've gained like 4-5 kgs and it’s really killing my self esteem and confidence. Uni kept me active (did not do any sports I’m just talking about daily commute) and I almost never exercised either plus my daily calorie intake wouldn’t cross over 1500. Not a fan of most junk and I dislike sweet things too so I don’t snack as often either.

But after uni finished and I came back home my sudden weight gain over the span of a month has left me feeling awful so I’ve been trying my best to get fit. 

I consume upto 1100 calories in a day, have always done intermittent fasting out of habit, do some light strength training (very new to this) and do core strengthening exercises plus 20-30 mins of cardio, I walk upto 5-6k steps a day and can’t go out cuz I’ll burn in the heat(day and night) so I try making up for the steps by moving at home as much as I can.

But the scale hasn’t budged, no noticeable difference in the mirror and the tummy hasn’t budged either. Idk what I’m doing wrong? Am I not working out enough? ",2025-08-07 12:27:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mjyptb/on_a_calorie_deficit_and_i_exercise_yet_weight/
1mjpwnf,loseit,Really need advice on a good food tracker app so I don’t fixate and obsess (AuDHD),"Hello! 

I’m 30F 291 lbs, and I’m AuDHD. I finally got back into the habit of going to the gym and enjoying it by listening to my “gym only audiobook.” I’m going 1-2 times a week, slowly increasing to 3-4x. I also mountain bike and do occasional hot yoga. 

Since I got super serious about the gym a month ago, I was eyeballing cutting my portions, choosing better options, limiting caffeine, and doing my damndest to cut back my Coke Zero and drink more water. 

My gym program is a scheduled workout 4 days a week, and I just choose which workout to do (there is squat day, shoulder press, Deadlifts, and bench press), then a bunch of strength building and stretching exercises with the weights. 

On to my actual problem. I have tried and done all kinds of things in the past (keto, intermittent fasting, etc) to help lose weight. I’ve found that when I count calories I become EXTREMELY OBSESSIVE about it to an unhealthy degree. I also only weigh myself once a month. However. Now that I haven’t lost any weight this past month, I’m trying hard not to get depressed since I made changes and I see no results. 

I believe I need to start documenting my actual food intake. Is there a (preferably free, or at most $5/mo) app I can use that doesn’t have a primary focus on calories? I can still see my intake, number, but it focuses more on macros, or something else? 

If helpful, I’m not on any birth control, I got sterilized last year and have been off depo shot for 16 months (it effed me up). I only take RX metformin, a non-stimulant ADHD med, and an acne med.",2025-08-07 03:53:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mjpwnf/really_need_advice_on_a_good_food_tracker_app_so/

TDEE calculator estimates my maintenance at about 3000-3100 cals. 
My old P.T (a bodybuilder) had me on a diet of around 2400 cals but it felt like WAY too much food (I was having to cook non-stop and eat ALL day.)

I dropped my daily intake to about 2000 cals which felt okay but still felt like quite a lot of food. 

This past week I’ve dropped down to 1800 daily which honestly feels perfect to me! (I’m able to hit all my macros which are approx. 180-190g of protein + carbs and 40g of fats). 

However, based on everything I read, this deficit seems way too “extreme” and I’m worried about causing long term damage to my body or complicating my weight loss journey!

1mhqajh,loseit,Can’t stay in calorie deficit due to insatiable hunger. What am I doing wrong??,"Hello! 31F, my stats are listed below along with my workout schedule. 

I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong! I have been working out/eating as best as I can for three years and I cannot lose any weight because I constantly eat over my calorie deficit. And why? Because I’m CONSTANTLY hungry. Sometimes it’s insatiable hunger for simple carbs/sugars - this happens, most often, when I’ve been working out a little harder than usual and my body is tired/sore. Sometimes it’s just pure hunger for ANYTHING, despite eating a full day of protein, fiber, & healthy fats.

I constantly try to keep my blood sugar stable by starting every meal with fiber (veggies) or protein and saving simple carbs/dessert for the end of the meal. I drink water with vinegar regularly before meals to cut the blood sugar spikes as well. I also try to limit my eating window to 9 hours per day and don’t snack between meals.

Anytime I’m having either general hunger or sugar cravings that won’t go away at the end of the day, I try all the tricks:
- Distract myself
- Drink a large glass of water (sometimes w/ vinegar or allulose added to curb cravings)
- Eat some low-calorie bulk foods like raw veggies or berries
- Drink herbal tea
- Take a brisk walk or other short exercise

Unfortunately, my hunger is almost always still there after trying these tricks and I eventually give in to it. If I try to go to bed while still feeling hungry, I typically can’t sleep. 

I just don’t understand - what am I doing wrong? Every website tells me that working out regularly, intermittent fasting, controlling my blood sugar, and eating lots of fiber & protein should make me LESS hungry. So why am I so g—d— hungry all the time???

1mf9971,loseit,"What I've learned about weight loss, and my advice:","I've been on diets for so many years of my life, and they've ranged from unhealthy to very unhealthy.  And I watched hundreds of weight loss videos and advice videos.  But this summer I have found what works the best for me.  I have a binge-eating problem and I used to really eat my emotions, and since I go to school I would gain a lot of weigh during the school year, especially finals week and whatnot.  I would then lose all of that over the weekends or the summer by: only eating one yogurt a day.  Which obviously is NOT HEALTHY AT ALL.  I mean, I will tell you right now I dropped weight so fast, but in reality I wasn't really losing fat, I mean not really.  Sure I had lost weight fast but I had no energy and I was obsessively weighing myself.  It honestly became so unhealthy mentally.  Not to mention physically, obviously it is not good because you're not getting your proper nutrition, not to mention it's not sustainable, and will WRECK your metabolism.  Which I still deal with problems to this day with digestion(I'm serious, that diet was not worth it for how constipated I am right now)  What made me stop that diet was actually this year.  I had attempted to do it again but I kept binge-eating and felt so awful about myself.  Like I've mentioned, a lot of my diets are not sustainable at all.  And you will gain that weight back.  It's called the yo-yo effect or smt like that.  But I lose all this weight and it bounces back just as quickly and you gain even more weight.  
I'm not going to say that losing weigh is easy, because I know that it's difficult for a lot of people, and I struggled with it a lot too.  
But now I don't diet-  I've changed how I eat.  This is what I do, to lose weight slowly and in a way where I won't gain it back:  
I know that eating 3 times a day at a designated time is this huge thing in most people's lives, I disagree with that.  During the first like 2 weeks I did OMAD(one meal a day), I just ate a good healthy lunch and then maybe some fruit during the afternoon and that was it.  Not super sustainable, but it helped me lose a lot of weight.  But you know, I grew kind of tired and my mindset got toxic about food again so I changed it.  Now, I personally 2 meals a day.  Lunch and dinner.  I'm not a breakfast kind of gal and I honestly just upset my stomach when I eat in the mornings.  But I do drink like this water with this fiber powder thing in the morning.  But my thing is: Only eat when you're hungry!  You don't have to fit yourself into this 3 meals a day thing if you just aren't hungry.  Eat when you're hungry, and only when you're hungry. Another thing I do is that I don't eat past a certain time, I know a lot of ppl call it intermittent fasting.  But I don't really think of it like that.  I just think it's good for your body to be eating so late at night since that's when your body is doing a lot of digesting and whatnot, especially in your sleep.  Anywho, I eat dinner late- so around 7:00-8:00 and after that I don't eat anything.  I let my body and my digestive system rest and do it's thing for the rest of the night until I eat again which is in about 15ish hours.  And it's worked great for me, obviously everyone is different so this might not be perfect for you.  But long story short, eat when you're hungry, but don't eat super late at night.  
What I decide to eat for those two meals is not really something I prep, but I do defintiely try to get those vegetables and protein sources in.  But I'm not obsessively counting those either.  Like one day for lunch I might eat a salad because that's what my body is craving(Oh another thing, in the beginning when you're trying to eat healthier it'll be hard because your body is constantly craving sweets, and I'm not saying my body isn't anymore, but there are days where I am actively seeking out salads and things like that) and another day I might eat something heavy on carbs.  It doesn't really matter as long as I eat my meals and enjoy them. While eating it's really important that you ENJOY the food.  Chew for longer, put down your silverware every time you take a bite(that way your body isn't like waiting for another bite, because your brain  will like get anxious and impatient to get another bite, so just set it down until you're ready to take another bite).  Think about the flavors, the textures, just really savor the food.  Another mindset that you have to change is food scarcity, let your brain and body know ""I can always have this later"", ""It won't be gone"", ""I can buy this again"" so you're not like rushing to eat all of the food that you have.  Another thing is eat until you're full.  I feel like this gets a little controversial, but don't eat more if you feel full, even if there is food left on your plate.  Obviously I'm not saying waste food, but I'm saying when you get your food get a smaller portion, and then if you finish it and still feel hungry you can get more.  Or if you got too much, don't force yourself to finish it because it's there.  I mean, either way in my opinion it's a waste of food because you're forcing it down, and that's just not good for you either.  For my family, food is a big thing.  It's a time where the family gets together and eats, and a lot of our love language is through food, so it was hard for me to let those things go.  
Another thing I have implemented: snacking less. I used to eat A LOT of snacks.  But now I'll have like a few pretzels(Dot's, they're so good!) or like a chocolate if I feel it.  And sometimes I do really crave it, but I drink water and get on with another activity.  Snacking and that much sugar is not that good for you and I've supplemented it with fruit.  Fruit is sooo good!  It's refreshing, sweet, and flavorful.  I personally have definitely upped my fruit intake(too much fruit is not good because they have high sugar content), but it's better than eating a whole cake yk?  I mean, it makes my body feel better too.   It can be subtle, but I feel better when I get more fresh produce into my body.  And that's it, and I lose weight . Sure I'm not dropping like 5 pounds a week, but I can notice my body getting slimmer and I feel better about myself, and the weight is dropping, but not coming back!  And this is so much easier to handle, and I don't really consider it a diet.  I just think, I'm more mindful of my eating and I'm just listening to my body.  What I've noticed too: my appetite has gotten smaller, I don't have to eat as much or as often.  My cravings have gone down and my binging has gone down because it's not like I'm not allowing myself to not eat sweets or snacks so I still get to fill in that craving if I have it.  But now my body actively craves fresher foods:)  
I also work-out(I do home workout vieos) for maybe like 30 minutes to an hour daily.  I find it fun, obviously sometimes I get lazy and don't go, or have to force myself.  But it's something I've added and something I've come to enjoy more and more.  You could also walk on the treadmill, run, take a walk outside, go to the gym, anything that involved moving your body.

Summary:  
\- Eat only when you're hungry

\- Drink lots of water

\- Stop eating when you get full

\- Try to add more vegetables and fresher products into your meals

\- Don't eat super late at night

\- Eat what you want but in moderation

I promise, it's not super complicated and you get a lot of benefits aside from losing weight:D",2025-08-01 21:46:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mf9971/what_ive_learned_about_weight_loss_and_my_advice/
1meh4ts,loseit,Giving up on trying to reduce my abnormal appetite,"After a lifetime of food obsession and eating for pleasure rather than health and nutrition, I eventually ""locked in"" and changed for the better. It's been about a year since I've started mending my relationship with food, and I don't ever plan on returning back to how I used to be with the binging and overeating; even though I sometimes miss the freedom of eating whatever, whenever, I've accepted that I ultimately want my life to be the way it is now, rather than being controlled by food.

The *one* thing that still bothers me isn't necessarily the taste of the foods, but more-so the constant mental fixation on eating. Whenever I finish a meal, I'm always impatient for the next one, and I'll always *wish* I could have as many helpings and servings as I want. It's like even after mastering the art of controlling myself around food, my appetite and the pleasure that I derive from eating is still abnormally high. I still have many moments throughout the day where I'll keep experiencing urges and desires to eat everything in sight, even after having mastered them.

That's why at this point, I've decided that I'll simply learn how to defuse and unhook myself from those urges whenever they come, rather than use techniques to curb my appetite. I'm no longer going to try to get rid of the food noise altogether, because I think that if I made lifestyle changes dedicated to reducing food noise, it'll end up having the opposite effect and just making it louder. I've tried intermittent fasting before, eating less carbs, a shit-ton of fiber, protein, fat, volume-eating, etc., and even then, my appetite still remains extremely big the majority of the time.

I've accepted that I probably can't make my appetite go away, and that I'll have to spend the rest of my life taming it. That's fine with me. If I *do* follow certain patterns of eating/dieting, it'll just be for health benefits rather than to curb my appetite, because I'm done with stressing out over my food noise and constantly being anxious about it. I've been employing Acceptance & Commitment Therapy techniques like psychological defusion, emotional unhooking, etc. to deal with food noise when it comes, and it's been working great. It's taught me to control myself around food regardless of whether I'm experiencing urges or not, because I just can't count on suppressing my appetite anymore.

Just sharing this because I wonder if anyone else's approach to food is similar. I've just given up on trying all of these techniques to curb my appetite because ultimately, it'll always just return. I've just decided that I can't control my gluttonous urges - instead, I can simply control my actions and not let those urges control me. I'm alright with spending the rest of my life doing that.",2025-07-31 23:38:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1meh4ts/giving_up_on_trying_to_reduce_my_abnormal_appetite/

I'm just trying to get help. Sorry its long!

I(19F 5'4) recently went to the my gynecologist since I have issues with my menstruation. I never really went through puberty, like the typical stuff, lots of body odor, some noses grow, lots of sweating etc. I kinda just got my period and that was it. But it has never been regular, I can go 3-4 months without it and when it does come it can last up to a month, longest it lasted was almost 3 months. Anyways my gyno did tests and my thyroid was good, but told me I had PCOS, nothing strange as it runs on the family. And she let me know that I had actually gained weight since the last time she saw me which would have been like 3 weeks before. Last time I was 246lb and now I'm 252lb. I wasn't eating more or anything, yet i still gained so much weight. My guess is that i was more sedantry as I had just gotten back from college. Every doctor I've been to has always told me to loose weight and I have tried my whole life... I have never been skinny, I was always bigger on the scale at the doctors, even as a baby. And every time I just gain weight. I have counted and weighted calories, intermittent fasting and exercised daily yet nothing. 

Could I have been doing it wrong? for sure, I didn't stick to it for long yes, I kept forgetting to track and eventually gave up. I dont eat a lot... I eat twice a day, breakfast and dinner.

I'm not going to the gym but I am part of a dance team and dance every week for 4+ hours so I'm not just sedentary all the time, except for college classes.* Usually I eat around 1600-1700 calories... sometimes less. I've had my struggles with ED, with overeating or under eating. I get full really quickly hence why I only have breakfast and dinner.

I know Im a picky eater but I try not to be, thankfully I'm not on the extreme side of picky eating. A lot of it has to do with texture, other things are just nasty lol. 
I eat most fruits(love them as snacks) and the basic veggies.
Veggies I eat: carrots, corn, broccoli, tomatoes, lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower(sometimes), beets. I would like to eat more but it's hard. Peppers and onion I can eat as long as I cant feel them and they have to be cooked. If anyone recommends pickles Im not doing it, hated them my whole life.
I struggle with meats, I dont really like red meat, I eat chicken and sometimes ground turkey.* I like fish, mainly tuna.I drink almond milk, dont like regular milk. I do eat dairy but carefully bc I'm lactose intolerant. I dont like to oil fry things, I air fry or oven bake. And I drink 40+oz of water daily, just cause that's all I drink. I dont like sodas other than sprite and that just occasionally, like parties or when eating out. Juices...Gatorade but only when I can spare the grocery money which is not often. I admit I do love me some sugar but it's not all the time. It's either ice cream or chips ahoy. I want to add yogurt to my diet I just cant stand the dry texture, but I can try! *I dont like pizza or burgers.

Basically what Im here for is for advice, on how I can improve my diet and become more active. I can have the strength to change. I kept telling myself that I was very far from being 250-300lbs but now in a blink Im here and Im scared. I dont have crazy health problems other than the hormonal stuff and asthma which Im taking medication for both. Asthma as needed, metformin 3x a day. But even then I dont wanna develop any health issues. I can find and have the time in my schedule to add exercise. And I can eat healthier, I can quit sugar or try to quit most of it and I dont need fast food. I cook for myself, other than when Im home, cause then my mom cooks. 

How do I add more protein to my diet, considering I dont really like red meat? How can I safely and effectively quit sugar? How can I add more veggies to my diet? How do I safely add more exercise to my routine, and what should I start with? How can I make sure Im tracking correctly? I have a food scale and I use samsung health for tracking everything, food, medication, water, excerise, steps etc. Give me some recipes! I can exercise well, I'm not limited on body movement. I like volleyball and to dance and enjoy going on walks.

I'm done being overweight. I'm doing this for myself and my health. I want to lose weight safely, I would like to get down to 200lb and I will go from there. Please recommend a scale as I dont have one! :]

1mdaxbz,loseit,Is something off? I have lost 25lbs in 6 weeks.,"Never lost this much weight this fast and I wanted to put some feelers out to hear from people who:
- have experienced something similar 
- have a lot of knowledge about nutrition and physical fitness, through practice.

Before: Obese. Sedentary and uncontrolled nutrition before. Consumed maybe 5k+ calories a day. 2k steps on avg a day. 

Current: Obese. Workout 4-5x a week (3x cardio, 5x strength training (body or weighted)). Caloric deficit of 1500 and carbs under 40g. Intermittent fasting. I eat a few hours before a workout or after I workout. 13k steps avg a day.

Ecstatic to see scale change and then became concerned because it seems pretty quick.

I account maybe half of it as water weight but still. In 5 days I lost 5lbs (weigh myself in the morning. Mostly once a week but sometimes twice).

1mcfow9,loseit,Weight loss is such a trip!,"I was not an overweight teen (159cm hovered around 59-62 kgs) but I grew up in the toxic 2000s and comments were made about my ""thick thighs"" and big chest. That made food a guilty pleasure. I'm also a stress eater and would spiral into shame eating in secret multiple times. 

From 2017 to 2020 i was in such a place that I would be busy 6am to 10pm with extreme levels of stress. My weight touched 72kgs. The highest at that point. The pandemic was a turning point. I finally had time to work out and focus on eating well. After a year I was back to 62kgs. But then work started back up and I was constantly travelling. My diet fell apart, I didn't care anymore. By end of 2021 I was back to 69-70 kgs, but I was also giving a career defining exam and I stopped looking at the scale. 

Last year I finally cleared those exams and started a new job.  In Jan 2025 I started the gym where I saw my weight had touched 78kgs. I finally decided that no matter what I will stick with the gym. Turns out, I don't hate the gym like I used to think. I actually love it. But I wasn't counting calories, so the scale didn't move. Since the first week of June, I contacted a nutritionist because I also have a LOT of metabolic issues on top of my PCOS. I've stuck with that diet for 2 months now and as of yesterday, my weight is 70kgs. I'm stronger, thanks to weightlifting, and I look leaner at this 70kgs than I did when I was 70kgs in 2020. On Friday I got my periods naturally for the first time in 8 years. I also got allergy tests done and cut out my allergens. My skin has cleared up, my scalp has stopped itching and I'm not as gassy and bloated anymore. 

Also, has this happened to you? I have started intermittent fasting along with a low carb diet (I am pre diabetic and have insulin resistance). It took me 2 weeks to get used to it but I was doing fine. After I got my periods, I had 2-3 carb heavy days and I've gone back to my diet since yesterday. I'm struggling again with hunger pangs and headaches like I did in the initial days of the diet! So weird 😭 but anyway, just wanted to share this!!

1mbx57f,loseit,Need Some Help,"Hi guys, I'm new to this sub so go easy on me lol.

My mom (49 F) has been super upset by her stomach fat recently, and I don't really know how to help. The other day she told me that she can't look in the mirror without feeling ugly, and that broke my heart a little. This is obviously messing with her head.

She's often cited her c-section as a reason, so I don't know if it's something that can be fixed.  Is 13 years postpartum stubborn belly fat just inescapable? She eats pretty well---usually rice and broccoli for lunch, and barley flour fufu and soup for dinner. Fruits as snacks/dessert. She's even been taking long walks and intermittent fasting (skipping breakfast, etc) for a while, but nothing's really helped. In fact, her stomach has gotten larger. Maybe its bloating?

I really don't know what to tell her. I said I can give her a list of ab-focused cardio workouts from youtubers that I know have helped others (ex - chloe ting, growwithjo), but she really only has 20 mins daily to spare (at least to begin with right now). Will 20 min  tabata/zumba/cardio really help to burn it??? How do I help her?????

PS: she's 5'3. I don't know how much she weighs, but I do know she wears a 10 to 12 in most clothes (and often wears girdles) to hide her stomach.",2025-07-29 00:26:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mbx57f/need_some_help/
1mayd4f,loseit,I want to lose weight so I can kneel down during my proposal :(,"I’m 24 years old, 188 cm tall around 6'2"", and weigh 150 kg about 330 lbs. Honestly, my diet is a mess, lots of fast food, a long 9-to-5 job, and a tiring commute that makes it hard to stay consistent with healthy habits (I know it's all excuses, but you know :)  
But today, I signed up for the gym. I’ve got **40 days** before I propose to the love of my life, and I want to be able to **kneel with confidence**, without pain or embarrassment. I’m aiming big, like 1 kilo (2.2 lbs) per day, although I know that might not be realistic or healthy.  
A friend suggested trying **Muslim-style intermittent fasting** (no food or water from sunrise to sunset), followed by one coffee and three small meals after sunset. A gym session is recommended after breaking the fast, and one solid meal is suggested post-gym, essentially keeping the stomach empty for most of the day.

I’m willing to push myself hard. But I don’t want to crash, burn out, or damage my body in the process. So my question is, what’s the best and most effective approach to lose as much weight as possible in these 40 days?  
Should I do this dry fast thing? Switch to clean eating and train hard? Do OMAD (something like eating one meal a day in a short period) combined with Islamic fasting thing? I’m doing everything I can, but I need real guidance. If you’re willing to help, I’ll post daily updates here progress, diet, gym, weight. Just need some honest advice from people who’ve been through this.

1marnps,loseit,Healthier weight loss for me and a new calorie hack,"Hello! First time poster long time lurker 25 NB, 165cm and currently 74.5kg - I've always struggled with my weight and had to unlearn both sides of the over and undereating spectrum. 

I lost 15kg from my initial highest weight of 83kg in 2020 thanks to quarantine, but this was admittedly done very unhealthily - lots of heavy restricting and occasional binge purging (which I consider myself recovered from now yay) 
My lowest weight was 67kg - which admittedly for my height is barely within the healthy BMI range, but I did a lot of damage to my self-esteem and body getting there, so I do associate it with worse times for me. 

My recovery took me back up to 72kg which I didn't mind so much as I was keeping fit with pole fitness and powerlifting. I even ran a half marathon last year which seemed completely out of reach when I was my heaviest. 

However for the last few months I've been very sedentary due to some mental health difficulties and a stressful schedule, so I've lost a lot of the muscle mass I had when I was fit and am now sitting at 74.5kg but feel (and imo look) much bigger. My cardio fitness is nowhere near what it was this time last year and that depresses me big time. 

I'm wanting to restart my weight loss and fitness journey, back down to 69kg, so this post is a part  of that accountability process. 

My design is thus: 

- Slow, steady weight loss while taking care of myself - I've set a flexible calorie limit of 1400-1800 with some intermittent fasting thrown in.  


- Returning to my running and power lifting (don't have the self confidence in my body to go back to pole fitness atm - also expensive) with 2-4 gym sessions and/or runs a week, alongside daily stretching. 

Been going for about a week now and I already feel healthier and happier! I also discovered a very silly way for me to eat within my limit but still feel like I'm treating myself! I'll track the whole amount of something then stop eating it, then come back later and finish it off, feeling sneaky haha but without feeling like i'm losing progress.  

Thanks for reading this little ramble, I hope you have a happy day! ",2025-07-27 17:08:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1marnps/healthier_weight_loss_for_me_and_a_new_calorie/
1m9ws62,loseit,1 year of my weightloss journey.,"Hello, everyone! I realized that my weight loss journey began a little over a year ago, so I'd like to share how things have been going. 

For reference, I am 5'7, AFAB, in my early 20s. When I began in June 2024, I was 227 lbs, and today as of July 2025, I am now 185 lbs. That's 42 lbs gone! I'm really happy and I'd like to talk about how I did it if anyone is curious.

During the first few months, it was really hard...but I said goodbye to eating fast food, desserts, energy drinks and soda multiple days a week. I also dropped my calories from god knows how many to a nice 1500. I paired it with lots of exercise and managed to come down to at least 192 in November 2024. I had a really long and horrid plateau of 190 from November 2024 'til June 2025, when I had the bright idea of Intermittent Fasting. Instant game changer– I've dropped 5 pounds already in a month by doing 14 hr fasts all week and doing a 20 hr fast when I feel brave enough to attempt it.

I have two goal weights. One is to be 175 lbs– which is how much i weighed in 2023– and my other goal weight is 150 lbs. Happy to say I'm 10 away from the first goal! 

If I had some advice to give, first thing I'd say to be nice to yourself. If I crave some trashy food from McDonald's, I'll eat it! If I deny myself, I'll go crazy and binge eat. Unhealthy stuff in moderation is okay, don't fret. Second thing is, watch your sodium levels. When I cut out all of my fast food, my sodium was abysmal and I felt so bad physically and I had no idea why! However, having electrolytes and salting all of my food helped! Third, don't forget to move around. I hate exercise so much, it's AWFUL. But you'd be surprised what just a walk can do for you! 

My post was kinda long, sorry! But thank you for staying. I wish everyone good luck with their weight loss, you can do it! ✨ ",2025-07-26 15:53:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m9ws62/1_year_of_my_weightloss_journey/

2. Total steps in a day is average 25000 plus(I have increased it gradually, for the first month it was between 10-15K, next two months 15 - 25 K and 25k + starting from last week).

3.I have also controlled my food intake gradually restricting it to 1500 for first 2 and half months and now at 1200 (I skip breakfast, have 100 to 150 gms of rice with a veggie in lunch, milk tea with rusk twice a day and 3 roties for 100 GMS chicken with dry spicy gravy), have street food like noodles/Biryani once or twice in a week, but make sure to walk for 5 Kms right after that.


Now some stats -

I’m fasting moreso for the health benefits and an aid in maintaining my weight, possibly losing some body fat. I don’t have a lot of fat to lose but I do have some (5'8 ~147lbs, 24M)

I have limited dumbbells and no gym access so it’s extremely difficult to progressively overload. But I get a ton of steps a day (upwards of 20k) so my maintenance is pretty high. 2.3k at the least, and I’ve observed myself gaining 2lbs a month at an average of 2.9-3k calories a day.

All and all, I fast once a week or every two weeks. 40 hours. I don’t consider intermittent fasting “Fasting” since I’ve always done it even when I ate like shit. Sometimes I try to do OMAD unless it’s a day I work out

I’m 35 years old, female, 375 lbs, and recently diagnosed with PCOS. I’ve known for a while that I needed to do something about my weight, but I honestly feel overwhelmed and unsure where to even start – especially when it comes to calories.

I’ve seen some people my size say they eat 1500 calories a day, and others say that’s way too low and can hurt metabolism. Then there’s stuff about insulin resistance, low-carb diets, intermittent fasting, and my head is spinning. 😵‍💫

That said, I’ve already started making changes. I’m focusing on **low glycemic index foods**, eating more mindfully, and honestly – I’m at a point where **junk food and sweets just don’t have a hold on me anymore**. I’ve had enough of that cycle, and I’m committed to something better for myself.

Also, **despite my weight, I’m very mobile** – I’m a stay-at-home mom, so I’m on my feet most of the day chasing after my kids, cleaning, cooking, and just generally moving around. On top of that, I do **two 20-minute walks daily on the treadmill**, and I plan to increase that over time.

What I need help with now is **figuring out how many calories I should be eating daily** – specifically to **lose at least 13–15 lbs per month**. I know that’s ambitious, but I’m highly motivated and just want to start in a way that’s smart and not self-sabotaging.

If you’ve been in a similar place, I’d love to know:

* **How many calories did you start with at a similar weight?**
* **Did PCOS make weight loss harder for you, what made it easier?**

1m614jf,loseit,Help With Understanding Weight Gain While Losing,"Hello! I was hoping for some insight on my current weight loss. After years and years of failed attempts, I was at my highest weight outside of pregnancy. My job started a fitness challenge and it was the motivation I needed. It included a free trial gym membership, nutrition counseling, and two personal trainer sessions. 

Well, since May 1st I have lost 15 pounds! (Well, I think. More on that in a moment.) The people I have worked with have been so supportive and nurturing. I truly feel like weight loss is no longer dieting, but lifestyle changes. I even kept the gym membership! There have been some wonderful, positive changes.

One habit I cannot break is the daily weigh-in. I like data and tracking and this has been a very tough one to stop doing. I was over the moon when last Monday I reached 15 pounds lost. On Thursday we went to a friend’s BBQ. I did eat some foods I hadn’t had in a while (a hot dog and some potato salad) but I ate them in moderation, loaded up on salad, and I did have a beer. On Friday, I weighed myself and I had gained SIX pounds! Okay. I know I didn’t overeat calories enough to gain six pounds of fat and I’m sure some of it was water weight from the food and beer, but six pounds? I went back to my usual new eating habits. Gym classes were continued throughout. Well, here I am in the next Monday and I only lost 2 of those pounds I gained from after the BBQ. I am now 4 pounds heavier than I was last Monday when I was celebrating the 15 pounds lost. Now I’m back at 11 and it feels like a huge step backwards and a huge failure. 

Does anyone have any insight as to what could have happened? I am doing intermittent fasting. I eat 30-40 grams of protein a meal. Not eliminating carbs, but avoiding and minimizing and choosing healthier carbs. Definitely avoiding sugars. No soft drinks, no candy, no chips. I am eating 1450-1500 calories a day which was calculated by the nutritionist to be on track to lose roughly a pound a week. I didn’t think one night of relaxing with friends and having one beer would destroy me this much. I’m a little concerned. Looking for any thoughts. I know I can stay on track and get over this, but it helps me to have an explanation. My husband and I are going to a wedding next month and I thought I would be able to have a “free” or “cheat” night of enjoying some good food and drinks and now I’m scared I won’t be able to do that without taking huge steps backwards. 

Thanks for reading, I appreciate it! I’m all parts excited that I am committed to doing this right and in a sustainable way(even though the weight loss is slower) to keep the weight off, but I’m also terrified that I won’t be able to enjoy “guilty pleasure” food every once in a while without an experience like I had this week. It’s really left me drained and confused that I’m 4 pounds heavier this week than last.

1m5q672,loseit,"I seem to be losing weight by snacking throughout the day, coming off years of intermittent fasting","From my personal experiences I'm starting to see the body is much more complex than some people claim. It's not only CICO, if you're in a healthy state then maybe yes, but the assumption is that every human has everything else in their body healthy and that things like hormones and conditions that prevent weight loss are not involved.

For over a decade I've been intermittent fasting. And I didn't lose much overall, maybe 60 pounds in years. But the past year I've been in a complete halt of a plateau. From ideas I was told before which I didn't listen to till now I made a plan to eat something very light every hour from when I wake up to my last meal around 5-6pm.

I mean if nothing else was working I figured I'd self experiment.

I started with eating one single almond every hour and having a regular lunch. After a week I added a light breakfast and incorporating anything from fruit or a cookie or whatever every hour or so.

 Mind you, I've been told that snacking is bad, that it only matters how many total calories I ate, etc. whenever I explained my situation I was told I wasn't paying attention to what I eat (I was super strict in not even snacking and just eating once a day) miscounting calories, I've been told a variety of things I knew wasn't true. And I hate arguing with random people online. But also hate arguing with those around me and especially doctors.

 Anyways I've been eating more in general but I've been losing weight finally. I don't try to eat too much when I snack but just enough to stimulate my body. And when previously I'd go to the bathroom (poop) once or twice a week. I'm going to the bathroom 2 times a day. 

It's still early into my experiment but it's an interesting experience and hopefully keeps working. It's actually strange to me I even put an alarm every hour to snack something, preferably healthy like nuts, fruit, seeds, vegetables, etc. but I just wasn't used to eating more than once or twice a day.

The closest gym is 30 minutes away and my husband has offered to stay home with the baby on his off nights from the gym so that I can go. We live 5 minutes from a park with a quarter mile track that I could take my toddler to. I just for the life of me cannot find the motivation. I want to add that I’m a SAHM and we want to try for another baby but I am terrified of getting pregnant again and gaining another 50 pounds. Being much more than what I weigh now is honestly my biggest fear. And that should be enough to get my ass in gear and do what  I need to do but I’m just having a hard time.

A started this journal exactly 4 months ago today. I'm down 55 lbs, from 268.8- 213.2 as of this morning. For context, I'm 30 M, 5'10. My short term goal weight is 200 lbs, but ideally I would like to hover between 185-195 eventually. Once I get to 200 I'll take my foot off the gas a bit tho.

According to my stats, calorie calculators have me at 1300 calories to lose 2 lbs a week (I put sedentary even though I'm somewhat active- 9k steps average and exercise at least 3 times per week, which is just walking/hiking on the weekends).

The last few weeks I'm losing on avg 3.5 to 4 lbs a week. I know the reccomended amount is to lose no more than 2 lbs a week. I fear I'm prob just losing muscle at this point and no fat. I don't want to just look skinny fat shirtless once I've reached my goal weight.

I do want to add that I genuinely think I'm eating enough. I'm never starving myself. I mostly only eat whole foods and I only snack on veggies and fruits or like pretzels. I do intermittent fasting. I eat light throughout the day (about 500-600 calories) and then my one main meal is for dinner.

I'm open to any suggestions if the way this is going for me is wrong.

Should I start getting in the gym now? Should I eat at maintenance for a while?

ive been in a calorie deficit of 500 cals. i’ve only 5 kg left to reach my goal weight (maybe even more but we’ll get there when we get there) and i’m finding it so hard to stay motivated. 

it might not seem like much, i’ve only been doing this for a year and three months, but to me it’s felt like 17 years. i’m no longer able to cope with the TEDIUM that is being in a caloric deficit, especially now with “heroin chic” being in and shit. 

i don’t mind counting calories. i enjoy taking my (almost daily) 10k steps. i don’t mind intermittent fasting. i definitely do not mind being able to notice changes, but lately i haven’t been noticing changes. 

i’ve been comparing myself a lot lately, too. being into fashion definitely doesn’t help. 

i knew this journey was going to take a long time, i was prepared for it to take even longer than expected, i was told it would. but holy shit.

And for the following paragraphs, yes I am 1000% sure the calories were tracked correctly.

Two years ago, I was doing the same thing with less frequency and saw consistent results, so I don’t understand what changed.

For about a year (3 months prior to my current situation), I did MMA 5 times a week but had to stop due to injury. I saw some results then, but they were painfully slow. I was eating about 1700 calories and getting 10k steps a day, only to lose 0.5 kg per week while feeling sick all the time from the lack of food.

I’ve also tried intermittent fasting and keto, each for about 2 months, but neither gave me significant results.

1m07nj8,loseit,Can't lose weight with 8-16 intermittent fasting,"hi all. i did 8-16 intermittent fasting last year for around 3 months and only lost 2 pounds. this was with a calorie deficit (ate 1200-1300 calories per day) and 10k steps a day. i'm 5'5 and 139 lbs for context.

i tried dieting again. started in june 2025. i upped my fasting to 6-18 and this, along with omad, are the only fasting methods that seem to work for me. no matter how little i eat, if i have an eating window greater than 6 hours, i literally lose 0 lbs. 

why could this be the case? i'm so frustrated because my schedule makes it reallyyyy difficult for me to follow a 6-hour eating window. i'm eating so little but because i keep on going beyond the 6-hour window, i'm not losing any weight. just to add more context, i have a food scale and weigh everything so, more or less, i think my calorie counting is accurate. i just want to know why a simple calorie deficit doesn't work for me. i want to know why i have to go to extremes just so that i can lose a pound.

i have pcos but my parents don't really want to take me to a doctor because they think everything is just normal (not from the US btw and am still a student).",2025-07-15 03:49:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m07nj8/cant_lose_weight_with_816_intermittent_fasting/
1lzym9x,loseit,Fasting + an attempted deficit to lose fat,"I've been practicint Intermittent fasting since before I knew what it was, and before I gave a shit about being in shape, because I just didn't like eating late and eating too early. I never considered it a ""Fast"" since it's literally just the breakfast-lunch-dinner cycle.

I don't have a whole lot of fat to lose (149lbs,  5'8 24M) but I did put some on as a result of a few binge episodes during my ""Bulk"", I did get stronger but I'm focused on maintaining and possibly a slight deficit.

I remember attempting to maintain a deficit a year ago and while it worked, it was honestly horrible for me. Constantly thinking about all the foods I could not have, especially did not help to have morbidly obese family members (Who I live with) get on me for being ""Too thin"" (Back when I told them I was 160lbs because I knew they'd flip their shit if I told them I was 150, which motivated me to go down to 138) and shit talk me for ""Eating bird food"" when I finally found a rotation of healthy, large meals that I truly enjoy that are not as caloric.

This time, considering I work out more consistently, and walk alot more, I'm going to try and eat at what I think is my maintenance, give or take depending on how I feel, and a 40hr fast between 2-4 times a month. What was your experience with that? Combining a so-and-so deficit with fasting.

My goal will be a weekly/bi-weekly deficit of course. I focus on one or two big meals a day to reduce the food noise, no snacking, lets me be more flexible with my meals and feel stuffed while still being consistent. High protein, good carbs, and I make sure to limit my fats.

1lzx0u2,loseit,IF as a long term lifestyle,"Hello! New to IF (intermittent fasting), I’m about 2 weeks in and I’m loving it so far. I really enjoy this community and seeing the daily success stories. 

I tend to approach weight loss and fitness in a holistic manner. For example, I don’t want to count calories and spend hours in a gym if I don’t plan on doing that for the rest of my life because I want to things that are personally sustainable for me. I found what works best for me is 16:8 or 18:6 and focus on 90% whole foods.

My question is: those of you who used IF successfully to take off weight, what is your lifestyle now? (Do you still do IF? Do you still feel occasional hunger during your fasting windows? If you counted calories to reach your goals, are you still calorie counting? Did you go back to normal eating habits and are able to keep the weight off? If you still do IF, do you find that it impacts your life socially? Do you cycle on and off of IF for vacation, etc? Do you feel like you’re restricting/ how is your relationship with food?)

I've been struggling with weight loss for a long time. I've tried so many things — calorie counting, low-carb, cutting sugar, even some extreme diets — but I never manage to stick to anything long-term.

Recently I came across intermittent fasting. It seems more flexible and less stressful than tracking every bite. But I’m honestly unsure if it actually works or if it’s just another trend.

I'm tired of jumping between methods that don’t last. I’m looking for something that actually works, sustainably.

So I’m asking honestly: what really worked for you? What helped you stay consistent and see real results? I’d love to hear your thoughts or personal experience.

Thanks in advance 🙏

1lze607,loseit,"Need to, want to, start again ASAP, but unsure how to make it sustainable (500lbs)...","2021, weighing just under 500lbs, I decided to make what I hoped would be a permanent change in my life. I was 31 and had effectively removed myself from what is a normal life up until then, due to my weight and the various issues (physical + mental) it comes with. Of course at that weight, mobility and stamina (and many other things) are greatly impacted, but I took up boxing + weight-lifting and all things considered, did pretty well from the get-go. 

Combined with diet, I was able to drop 130lbs in the span of eight months. It took me a month or two to get to the point, but I eventually ended up training daily, sometimes twice a day, at least 2-3 hours/day, combination of cardio (boxing + elliptical) + strength/weight-training. Food-wise, I went too intense... most days I kept to 1,500 cal or less... somedays, I'd just do a 500cal meal and that was it... somedays I might go a bit above 1,500, but very seldom. I'd do a cheat meal every week or two. Ate very clean, kept carbs to a minimum- didn't hate my diet. My thing is, when I set my mind on something, nothing can break my focus- it is laser sharp and fixed on a target I will attain at any cost. Also, seeing the number go down 2-3lbs/day early on got me hooked on playing the ""scale game"", which imo is a large part of lead to this not being sustainable. 

Anyways, about a year and a half or two years into training, I sustained an awful gym accident (deadlift) resulting in four herniated discs, chronic acute sciatica, and some muscle-tears. When that happened, I fell off the wagon hard and gave myself permission to cheat more and more and more, until I eventually reverted into my old ways, eating without virtually any abandon or fear of consequence, until I found myself all the way back at my start weight of around 500lbs. 

It's now been almost two years since I was in a gym... what a difference, from training daily for 2-3 hours and eating so clean to a completely sedentary life, eating like garbage... I feel infinitely worse than I did when I weighed this much before the weight-loss, partly because of those injuries which went untreated, partly because of issues the weight-gain has brought along with it (which didn't exist before), partly due to being older now... I'm constantly in some kind of sharp pain, whether from my back (mid + lower) or hips or knees or gallbladder (which will likely need removal soon) or liver (fatty) or just drenching myself in sweat from walking the shortest distances or out of breath completely and unable to sleep without constantly awaking from whatever other random sharp pains my body has, or breathing issues. It's all began taking a toll on my mental health, taking me to super dark places I don't want to explore again. On that note, being as introspective as I am, getting to first-hand witness the correlation between mind and body health was incredible- had I not experienced it myself first hand, I'd never have believed how immense it was, and how incredibly closely-linked those things are. 

So here's the thing- and apologies for being so long-winding here, I wanted to be as thorough as possible-, I intend to ""start"" again once I wake up, in eight or nine hours time. I'm sure there are things here that ought to be addressed by a professional, but I'm not in any position to afford that and would much rather just like to start ASAP so as to get as far away as possible from where I currently am. I know I probably did certain things the first time around which were not long-term sustainable, i.e. the excessive training + too-low calorie consumption... Re: the working out, I can't do literally any of that at this point- I am effectively handicapped and almost completely sedentary. But I can start with calorie restricting, intermittent fasting (which I did before), and generally clean-eating for now- maybe in a couple weeks, once 10-15lbs down, I can attempt going for walks. 

Please, kind people, I'd really appreciate your advice here regarding what I should do, maybe differently, so as to ensure this will be a permanent change this time-- something sustainable for life--, because I genuinely would not have it in me to have to do this all over again a third time... I am just not that strong mentally. I need for this to be the real thing this time; a lasting change. I cannot live like this- my experience in life has been hellish for far too long... I want to start engaging in life. ",2025-07-14 05:27:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1lze607/need_to_want_to_start_again_asap_but_unsure_how/

I’m 24M, 172 cm, 98 kg right now. I do 6 PM–3 AM night shifts, so my whole routine is flipped.

My body fat is stubborn around my **stomach, thighs and bum**, even when I’ve lost weight before.

Here’s what my recent labs show:  
High CRP (inflammation)  
Low Vitamin D3 (9.5 ng/ml) and B12 (188 pg/ml)  
High prolactin (43 ng/ml) and cortisol  
Estradiol E2 is 41 pg/ml (upper range for men)

So I decided to fix this for real.

This is what I’m doing already:  
Intermittent fasting 16:8 with meals between 7:30 PM–3:30 AM  
Walking 12,000 steps a day  
Supplements: Vitamin D, B12, creatine, shilajit  
Planning to start **gym next week, 6x/week:** heavy lifting, HIIT, core

Problem is I’m **brand new to the gym** and have no trainer. I’m piecing workouts together from YouTube, Reddit, and random advice. I don’t want to hurt myself or waste time.

So I need your help:

1. How much fat or weight can I realistically expect to lose in **2 months**, assuming I put in full effort and stick to a strict deficit and IF?
2. What should I focus on in the gym to **target belly, thighs and bum fat** (even if it's overall loss habits)?
3. Any essential tips for a newbie in strength training—form, programming, recovery—that can help me avoid mistakes?

Where can I share my pictures?

1lvhrx8,loseit,My journey with losing weight. You can do it!,"Hi. I decided to share my recent experience which has been a wild ride and is still not over yet! But I am so overjoyed I feel the need to share it to the world. I stepped on the scale on 19th June and to my eyes, I was shocked like never - 80.5kg! I never really paid much thought into my weight (25M, 5'8/1m72 height) nor my diet, I was just living life as I liked, enjoyed beer every other evening, things were cool. But I did notice my belly was becoming more and more rotund since a few months. You don't even notice until it hits you someday, it like, creeps in. I concluded this was a mix of bad diet and a very sedentiary life (teaching people online). So I decided to refurnish my life a bit to drop back to a more managable number. I need to mention, at 20 I was very underweight (imo) at around 55kg, then in the span of one year I somehow gained 20kg. I think it was a matter of coping with stress that happened post-Covid and the fact by then you age simply. 

So what did I do? Employ a couple of rules:

\-no sugary drinks at all. I used to drink copious amounts of juices, but that's because I had to drink something. I slowly adapted to water and zero sugar drinks, it was easier than I thought. 

\-cut out potato chips for now, but I do intend to eat them again. But not like I ate 2-4 packs a week! One pack a week is gonna be just fine. Other trash like sweets, chocolate, alcohol, instant noodles and fast food also took a backseat for the time being. You don't need to drop it completely, I want to get back to this stuff too, but with a lot more moderation than before. I mean, my ass would sometimes wake up at 4 in the morning and devour a chocolate bar because I felt my sugar levels drop! Or start munching on a pack of chips. Go figure how bad that for your health can be!

\-go for a walk or a bike ride at least twice-thrice a week. 45 minutes of walking is already good, just about anything can work. I also did squats, crunches at times. At first my stomach hurt like hell but now it adapted to it.

\-never eat at night, I started practising intermittent fasting in some capacity, first meal the soonest I ate was at 10, the last at 18-ish. I sometimes even forgot to eat the first meal and ate later, but don't do that, you will feel shakey, dizzy and sorta fatigued. 

\-so in conclusion I ate two meals a day, some veggies, scrambled eggs and rye bread as the first one, some soup and small second course later on. I completely avoided snacks but I understand this can be hard for some. I just didn't feel the need to snack on something really for some reason. And don't avoid sugar 100% either! I ate a piece of cake my mom prepared each day pretty much. You NEED a bit of sugar to function anyway!

\-if you can't afford fatty fish or other healthy meats, think of getting Omega-3 tablets. They also helped me with hair loss, in general this diet made my hair more strong and less prone to fall off.

\-I drink a zero sugar 500ml can of an energy drink almost every day, and it doesn't hurt me!

Today we have the 9th of July. I step on the scale, I told myself I won't do it to ruin my self-confidence, lo and behold... 74,5kg. I fell back pretty much into my average weight, in just 3 weeks! But I don't think I'm done yet, now some of those new habits shall be brought into a more balanced diet.

\-eating more rye bread instead of plain white, but I won't run away from normal white bread either, keep it moderate

\-cutting out useless sugar, but I'll be a little less restrictive. Still no bottled juices, but a sweet every now and then won't hurt me. A chocolate bar every two days maybe or something. 

\-no eating later than 21-22 and even then it should be the lightest portion of the day, unless I'm out partying but one day of an alcohol binge with some fast food won't make me fat all over lol

 \-instead of devouring a 130 pack of chips in one sitting, I'll divide it into two days, also instant noodles once a week and not 2-3.

\-a tomato in the morning to your breakfast or some pickles are always a welcome addition.

Did my diet affect my well-being? Well, yes, I was more depressed and more emotionally needy to be honest. I felt a constant need to talk or hang out with someone, moreso than before. It was weird! I don't know if this is part of it but I assume it might be. I felt very light fatigue at times, but only if I really put off eating for much later because I had other things to do. But I didn't go crazy and I didn't feel very dizzy. I did also feel more sleepy in general and I could fall asleep much faster (which is a great thing too). I had to go to the toilet much less often and I had less stomach problems. But the funniest thing ever was, I had much more vivid dreams when I adapted to sleeping with an empty stomach, something I thought I wouldn't be able to do! And yet, here I am. 3 weeks, 6kg less, aiming for a bit more. And don't let BMI influence you. My grandpa told me, your weight is relative to your height. ""I was 1m75, and I was 75 when going to the army. I felt the best then and it seemed to be the perfect average weight."" Reading that me being 58-ish at 20 was ""healthy"" but somehow 72 is already bordering on overweight seemed insane to me. Bottom line, anything is possible if you're dedicated, you can do it, I did, so can you!

1luhzvw,loseit,Intermittent fasting has not helped me in the long term. Anyone relate?,"I just wanted to offer a different perspective on IF, considering it's sold as the holy grail of weightloss. Even though many people have had great results, I personally feel like it has hasn't helped me past the initial few pounds.

Basically, I adopted a 16:8 schedule and kept at it on and off for almost 4 years, throwing in an occasional 24h fast. It worked great in a period where I was working in an office and sitting on my ass all day. I was able to lose a good amount of weight and keep it off.

That said, I feel like my body never adapted to skipping breakfast. I'm a morning person and naturally wake up at 6 am, and get most things done before noon. My morning hunger never went away, despite everyone telling me the hunger is a learnt habit (I call bullshit on that). 

Basically, for 4 years, I've just tolerated being ravenous in the morning and just learnt to ignore my body cues. Then when my eating window would open, I'd go crazy and stuff my face. My meals got gradually bigger and bigger as the months passed. Before my period, I'd go on full on binges. I'd spend every minute of my fasting window planning my next meals. The times I broke down and ate breakfast, I'd feel horribly guilty and promise myself to fast even longer the next day.

Then my lifestyle changed and I became really sporty and active, which spiked my hunger even more. I should have let go of IF then and ate enough to fuel my body, but insisted because I still had some pounds to lose and people online kept saying it's the ONLY WAY to lose weight.

I'm just a few pounds away from my goal weight, but in the last year I've completely plateaued, and even starting gaining weight again. The reason is that I've basically been training myself to eat massive amounts of food in one sitting. It feels normal now to eat 900-1200 cals a meal, anything less just feels unsatisfactory. People always comment on how much I eat and wonder how it's possible for someone my size (I'm not longer overweight) to eat that much. Well, I basically starve myself the rest of the time.

That's not sustainable and I feel like I'm slowly developing BED. I get ravenous and then empty the fridge. I want to go back to eating three normal meals a day, but I've completely messed up my intuitive understanding of normal portion sizes.

Anyways, just wanted to offer a different perspective and see of anyone related. Not looking for advice on how to make IF work for me. I've tried all the advice and it just made everything worse. I don't have a history of ED prior to this.

Turns out if my body is consistently hungry at certain times of the day, maybe it's better to just eat. I'm hoping I won't gain everything back by quitting IF, but I can't go on like this. 

Does anyone relate?

Edit: I always eat high protein, high fiber, low carb meals. Please stop giving me advice on how to make IF work for me.

1lu5ebn,loseit,Diet plan ideas that would be easy for an adult with a moderate intellectual disability to follow?,"Hi everyone!

My client is a young adult with a moderate intellectual disability and is looking to lose weight. She is currently 155 lbs, and wants to get down to 120-130 lbs. Her family originally had her counting calories, but this was too tedious and complex for her to do. Meal prepping is difficult for her as her and her family aren't able to strictly adhere to that.

I'm trying to figure out some safe diets that would be easier for her to conceptually remember and keep to. I was thinking intermittent fasting since all she would have to do is remember when she's allowed to eat, but I know this doesn't guarantee calorie restriction. I also thought of restricting added sugar, as she would be able to look at nutritional labels for a 0% DV quickly or remember to refrain from eating/drinking obviously sweet foods.

I'm not an expert on weight loss or nutrition by any means, I am only her personal aide. Please let me know if these are good or bad ideas, and suggest any other ideas you may have! There's no expectations for results to be quick, and I'd appreciate suggestions that would have low risk of nutritional deficiency.

Thanks!

edit: better wording choices

1lw03fs,xxfitness,Enjoying the results,"I picked up surfing in my 30s as a fun way to get out and enjoy nature. 10+ years in I’m still not great at it - I can catch a wave on a mellow 2-3 ft day and go down the line. No fancy stuff. 

I’ve long felt like my lack of upper body strength keeps me from being able to progress. On bigger days, I get so tired from paddling out that I can’t catch a wave until I can rest a bit. I miss a lot of waves because my paddle isn’t very powerful. I also don’t surf all that often but that’s not something I can do very much about. 

I started lifting this year and while I’m still very new to it I’ve been pushing myself. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week to lift and do HIIT or hot yoga at least once a week. I’ve also started intermittent fasting, reduced my alcohol consumption drastically and upped my protein intake. I already eat pretty healthy and was pretty active to start, but this level of discipline is pretty new to me. 

This past holiday weekend, I went surfing for the first time this year and I’m so excited to notice an improvement in my performance and stamina. I can stay out for a 2-3 hour session without getting noodle arms. Im catching more waves, popping up quicker, getting into the wave more easily. I still suck of course, but im just so excited to see my hard work paying off. 

I’ve also lost about 10lbs and look better in clothes than I have in years, but being able to enjoy something I love to do more is way more motivating than anything else. 

What motivates you? Curious to know. ",2025-07-10 01:21:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1lw03fs/enjoying_the_results/

1mp7p2a,Biohackers,Help me live longer," 

**Background**

38M. Reasonably active. I had leukaemia when I was 9 and made a full recovery at 11. I had a mix of chemotherapy and radiotherapy so I’m aware my life expectancy is shorter than most people. My DNA is probably damaged and other form of cancer is likely to manifest at some point in future.

**Goal**

I’m trying to do whatever I can to extend my health span and lifespan.

**Diet:**

I’ve been doing intermittent fasting for 10+years. My eating window is around 6 hours. Twice a year I do a three-day water fast. I don’t restrict myself eating or not eating any particular group of food. I’ve tried to get more of my protein source from plants and reduce my protein intake. I’m still taking in between 50-70g of protein each day I reckon. I drink a lot of green tea/black tea (mainly Chinese tea)/matcha, averaging 6 cups per day. I use loose leaf tea so I just re-steep and add tea leaves if needed. I stop drinking caffeinated drinks from 2pm.

**Exercises:**

I have a desk job but I’m reasonably active. My apple watch tells me I work out roughly 60mins per day on an average week. My workout routine:

I hit the gym at least three times a week (a combo of strength training and cardio)

Interval training for 20mins at least once a week to get the heart rate zone 4+ for 80%+ of the time

I cycle to work (5 miles each way) twice a week. I also cycle to tennis etc. On average I cycle 40 miles a week.

I play tennis (or padel) twice a week (1 hr each)

I play badminton once a week for an hour

**Sleep**

I sleep reasonably well and normally manage to sleep for 8 hours per night.

**Questions:**

I think I’m doing okay on diet and exercise front (although always open to change for the better) so my questions are mainly on supplements:

What should I start/stop taking?

Should I space out when I take these supplements for maximum absorption (or so they don’t interfere with each other)? At thee moment, unless stated otherwise, I take my supplements in two chunks, morning, then after first meal, then magnesium 2 hour before bed time

With supplements, the markets aren’t regulated here in the UK so it’s difficult to know what brand to go for. Even if they claim they do independent testing and provide lab reports I don’t know if (1) they are fake reports or (2) that the reports are genuine but they do a switcheroo and give you something else. With common vitamins I can buy from some well known brands but with like NMN or Spermidine it’s really just about trust. Are there any reputable longevity brands in the UK?

1mi99yr,Biohackers,🧬 42yo → 33.7 epigenetic age: My 2+ year biohacking protocol (with failures),"Found this community and thought I'd share my journey. Started proper biohacking in spring 2023, here are my first two rounds of results.

**The Numbers:**

* Chronological: 42 years old
* 2023 epi age: 34.44 years
* 2024 epi age: 33.72 years
* 2025 test: Just submitted a few days ago (relationship stress + holiday chaos this year—a bit nervous about that one)
* Lab conclusion: ""No acceleration in epigenetic aging... effectively slowed the aging process""

**Lab Results:** [View all test results and analysis](https://imgur.com/a/saF3wDq)

**My Protocol:**

**🍽️ Nutrition:**

* 20:4 intermittent fasting (eating 12pm-4pm)
* Mediterranean diet at home, tracked macros: \~3000 kcal | 160g protein | 400g carbs | 75g fat (varies with training goals)
* Don't track when eating out (1-3x/month)
* No added sugar (stevia for tea/coffee, stevia/xylitol when cooking)

**💊 Supplements:** *Morning (fasted):*

* NMN: 500mg
* CaAKG: 500mg
* Ginkgo Biloba: 500mg *(honestly not sure why - friend's rec)*

*Breakfast (12pm):*

* Resveratrol: 1g
* Vitamin D3: 1000-2000 IU + K2: 100mcg
* Omega-3: 1000mg + Astaxanthin
* Super Greens: 8g + Collagen: 14g

*Evening:*

* NMN: 500mg + CaAKG: 500mg
* Magnesium L-Threonate: 1000mg

*Monthly:* Fisetin senolytic protocol (1500mg × 2 consecutive days)

**🏋️ Training:** Strength training 6/7 days (often short sessions)

**😴 Sleep:** 8 hours tracked nightly

**🧴 Skincare:** Basic care + 0.5% retinol (started 0.2%)

**What Didn't Work (hair loss proving trickiest):**

* **Finasteride** → ED (don't recommend)
* **Topical fisetin** → Zero improvement, plus this stuff is really nasty for your pillows/clothes
* Currently trying: topical minoxidil, LLLT, ketoconazole weekly (minimal visible progress)

**Lifestyle:**

* No alcohol/drugs (except occasional laughing gas at rave parties—it's legal here in Sweden! 🇸🇪)
* Had shockwave therapy for post-finasteride issues (no regrets)

**How I Feel:** Physically feel much better than 10 years ago, maybe even better than 20 years ago - mostly from exercise and nutrition.

Mind feels consistently sharp now vs the cloudy/slow feeling I used to get. Hard to pinpoint the exact cause - probably combination of factors (plus I actually use my brain more now!)

**Currently trying to solve:**

* Effective hair loss treatments
* Better age testing options in Europe
* Optimizing my protocol—please comment if anything jumps out as suboptimal.

Today I had two cups of coffee — and honestly, I felt great. I was focused, productive at work, had a deep meditation, and even talked more with my coworkers. It also helped me with intermittent fasting (I’ve been doing IF for about a month now).

But the truth is: I was addicted to caffeine in the past, and I really don’t want to go back to that. However I often feel mentally tired, slow, and low-energy, even when I sleep enough.

I’m looking for real, sustainable ways to have more energy naturally.
Are there any supplements, biohacks, or blood tests you’d recommend to check what might be missing in my body? I’m also open to adaptogens or other natural methods — ideally something that works well with IF (on an empty stomach).

Any advice or personal experiences would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!",2025-07-16 22:18:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1m1qdlp/what_can_i_do_to_have_more_natural_energy/

(M23)","I’m 23, a graphic designer from Denver, and my life’s been a chaotic mess of ADHD, low energy, and crap sleep. Work-from-home means I’m glued to my screen, but my brain’s like a pinball machine—jumping from logos to YouTube rabbit holes about sloths. I hit the gym sometimes, but I’m that dude hiding in the corner, praying nobody notices me. Sleep? 4-5 hours if I’m lucky, then I wake up groggy, dragging through the day.

I’ve been into biohacking for a bit, thanks to this sub and Huberman Lab podcasts. Tried intermittent fasting—made me hangry and unproductive. Lion’s Mane? Felt something, but not enough to write home about. Then my gym buddy, who’s all about optimizing, suggested Ashwagandha. I read up, found a study saying it drops cortisol by 30% and boosts sleep quality, so I figured, why not? I’m already a guinea pig, might as well.

Started with 650mg organic Ashwagandha with black pepper (for absorption, per some Reddit thread) every night. First week, nada. But by week 2, I was sleeping 7-8 hours, waking up actually rested. My Oura Ring data showed deeper sleep stages, which was wild. Energy’s up too—I can grind through 8-hour workdays and still lift without feeling like a zombie. Bonus: my bench press hit 200lbs, and my girlfriend noticed I’m less grumpy, lol. Maybe it’s the testosterone bump? Saw a study saying it can increase T by 15% in men, so I’m hoping that’s me.

I’m not saying it’s a miracle pill—you still gotta eat clean and not doomscroll till 2 AM—but it’s been my MVP.

1ljb16n,Biohackers,Improving sleep: how to fix a broken clock,"
Hi all,

I came across this paper a couple years back and decided to share. I've had trouble with sleep for nearly 10 years and thanks to this paper I started using light therapy in the morning. Helps me offset the grogginess from melatonin that I take every night. There are great insights in the paper so hopefully it helps someone out there.

Some cool facts:

* SCN
   * The SCN in your brain is the master clock of the circadian system. It's able to generate and sustain gene expression and physiological rhythms without any external influence
   * When cultured in labs it continues displaying coordinated rhythms for months

Hacking sleep

* Light
   * Light is basically the ultimate reset button and predictably phase-shifts your clock
   * A few days of natural outdoor lighting can shift melatonin rhythms by 2 hours
* Food
   * Meal timing shifts your clock. If you eat at inappropriate times, it shifts the clock in your liver, adrenal glands and fat cells. Basically this misaligns your system.
   * Time restricted feeding reverses this. Intermittent fasting FTW?
* Exercise
   * Acts as a secondary time cue that can strengthen weakened circadian rhythms
   * In aging studies, scheduled exercise boosted rhythm amplitude and accelerated recovery from circadian disruption.

Circadian rhythm & Aging

* Circadian system weakens with age. 40%-70% of elderly individual have sleep disruptions wich affects DNA repair, cellular cleanup (autophagy), and immune function.

Highly recommend checking the paper out. Hope this helps someone out there the way my light box has. I have a large one for home use and a smaller one for travel. Probably a decent chance it helps when jet-lagged/switching to a different time zone.",2025-06-24 13:24:34,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3856231/
1lenjru,Biohackers,Idea for a health dashboard that acts like a biohacking coach — would love thoughts,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been into biohacking for years: intermittent fasting, ice baths, creatine, supplements, tracking calories through various means, and getting blood tests to monitor allergies and inflammation.

Like many of you, I’ve ended up with data all over the place — workouts in Strava, calories/body fat & weight in another app,  heart rate in Apple Health, notes in my phone, blood results in random PDFs, and nothing talking to each other.

The idea I’ve been working on is a platform called [**SyncVitals.ai**](http://SyncVitals.ai) — a personal health dashboard that actually pulls this data together, interprets it and gives you actions with it.

Here’s what it would do:

* Integrates with Apple Health, Strava, blood tests, and manual logs (like sleep, alcohol, supplements, etc.)
* Let you upload food photos or manually enter meals — and use AI to estimate nutrition
* Include a daily check-in flow for things like energy, mood, meds
* Use GPT-style AI to give you personalised insights and actions based on your goals (e.g. weight loss, performance, inflammation reduction)
* Show trends and summaries — like a daily/weekly “coach” that says here’s what’s working, here’s what to watch

Instead of just aggregating data, it would actually interpret it — and help guide your habits without you needing to manually cross-reference five apps.

It’s still just a concept — I haven’t built it yet — but I’m trying to validate whether this resonates with others before going all in.

If this sounds like something you’d use, you can check out the concept and register your interest via the waitlist here: [**https://syncvitals.ai**](https://syncvitals.ai)

It would genuinely help me know if this is something worth investing in & building. Happy to take feedback or hear how others are solving this for themselves in the comments. 

Cheers,

1lbdnzi,Biohackers,Health has only gotten more complicated over time and it gets harder to improve. I feel like the amount of changes I've been making and regimens I've refined are becoming unsustainable. I'm not even sure what I'm trying to describe but.. if you can indulge me.,"I've had autoimmune thyroid disease for as long as I could remember and felt pretty much uncomfortable for the better part of my life. When the pandemic started, I was forced to turn inward and figure out what would cause my autoimmune issues. Keto and gluten free, along with intermittent fasting, were all miracle cures for me and I felt like I was on top of the world.

I had gotten COVID three times since 2020 and found that life doesn't feel quite the same since getting sick. I also had crippling depression after a psychotic break and a failed marriage a few years ago. Since getting my life and health back together, I've made significant improvements in that time but I am left with this chronic exhaustion that I feel on most days and it's hard to pinpoint what it could be.

I've found the iodine protocol, in addition to cutting out gluten, to be the very thing that resolved my Graves'/Hashimoto's. After researching for flares of hidradenitis suppurativa, researching autoimmune health, and researching my own genetic SNPs, it lead me to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). Through experimenting with supplements that calm mast cells and histamines, I have been finding more relief, but it is still taking time for my body to heal. Despite feeling real progress, I still have this chronic exhaustion that often leaves me depleted from doing most things in my life.

I take roughly 10 supplements and I for sure can't get most of them through food, alone. I'd like to think in my head if my body could be replete of various nutrients, I wouldn't have to resort to supplements, but it feels like a lot. The amount of new info I stumble across only adds more to my growing knowledge base and less space on my shelf of a pharmacy. I haven't been regularly exercising since before I got COVID last year and exercise is nowhere near what it was if I ever feel like getting active.

Does anyone feel like they're on a hamster wheel and just constantly experimenting into a void?",2025-06-14 17:08:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1lbdnzi/health_has_only_gotten_more_complicated_over_time/
1l7o7ay,Biohackers,I'm truly convinced nearly all mental issues are rooted from the gut,"I’m fully convinced that the gut truly functions as a second brain and when it’s not operating optimally it seems to lay the foundation for many psychiatric disorders

Before I experienced my panic attack again after nearly five years without one I had been dealing with persistent bloating and constipation and at the time I was bulking meaning I was eating above my maintenance calories to gain muscle

Looking back it’s clear I was putting serious strain on my digestive system and when you add stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, and poor digestion to the mix your gut inevitably starts to suffer

I decided to start intermittent fasting and shifted to lighter easier to digest foods like arugula, tuna, eggs ect and over time I began to feel better

The real breakthrough came when I introduced yogurt and kefir into my routine like today despite only getting four hours of sleep due to an early morning doctor’s appointment with my mom I felt surprisingly calm and relaxed

I couldn’t figure out why until I came across a video explaining how many psychiatric conditions are linked to poor gut health

It all made sense every time I had a panic attack in the past I’d experience bloating and a heavy sensation in my stomach

From now on I’m prioritizing gut health and honestly kefir has been a game changer

1kzus25,Biohackers,Unpopular Opinion: Eating once a day is ruining your metabolism,"I am a firm believer that those who persistently implement intermittent fasting or eat only once a day are deliberately sabotaging their metabolism. IMO when your body does not know when the next meal is coming, it will do everything in its power to store what it can. 

Based on my observations from colleagues, family members, and the elderly. Smaller but frequent nutrient dense meals + activity has a much greater impact on body weight regulation than regular intermittent fasting.

This is not to say that there are no health benefits to be had from fasting however. I feel more extreme 24-36 hour fasts are preferable every few months or so.

I'm a teacher and I've been on a long holiday (6 weeks).

But I'm dreading going back because I always get sick! 

I know it comes with the territory. I interact with more people in an enclosed space (a classroom) than most people... 

But... 

I get sick so often even though I live a MUCH healthier lifestyle than almost everyone I know.

If I had to guess, I'm getting sick at least 6-8 times throughout the year.  

But the worst part is when I get sick, it often lingers on for weeks or a month (usually a cough that won't go away).

I try to be mindful to wash my hands often, but those damn kids always get me sick!

What are some of your secrets to avoiding getting sick? 

A little background on my current lifestyle:
-drink homemade kefir daily so my gut biome should be pretty good

-generally get around 7+ hours of sleep a night. Never less than 6.

-intermittent fasting 16/8 almost everyday

-supplements I take (d3/k2, magnesium glycinate, cod liver oil, recently added boron, copper, and zinc)

-exercise a lot (something everyday. Either calisthenics or jiujitsu (or both). Sometimes running. Although sometimes I wonder if I push too hard on my training that it's weakening my immune system)

-I don't smoke or drink

-eat a lot of eggs, meat, dairy (mostly meals I cook myself using butter or coconut oil instead of seee oils)

-drink homemade bone broth everyday

-walk a lot every day (I don't track my steps, but its a more than most people)

1koc3h2,Biohackers,"Struggling With a Sluggish Metabolism Despite High-Protein Diet and Regular Exercise , Supplement Advice?","Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out to see if anyone has insight or personal experience with supplements that could support a stalled metabolism. I’m a 35-year-old male, 6ft3, currently 233 lbs, and despite putting in significant effort, I’m finding it nearly impossible to lose weight.

Some background:
I’ve struggled with eating disorders and chronic caloric restriction since I was 15, which I suspect has taken a serious toll on my metabolism. For a long time, I practiced intermittent fasting and often under-ate. Now, I eat regularly, aiming to repair the damage and support my body properly.

My current routine includes:
	•	Diet: High-protein (~180g/day), low-carb (but not keto), one cheat meal per week, and mostly whole foods like eggs, BBQ meats, vegetables, green tea, and water.

	•	Exercise: 3x per week with calorie burn between 700–900 per session.

	•	Supplements: Daily multivitamin, Vitamin D, B50 complex, zinc (with occasional copper to balance), omega-3, green tea extract. I’ve recently stopped NAC and acetyl-L-carnitine after 3 months. I also took Lactobacillus gasseri probiotics after a round of antibiotics.

	•	Hydration: Not perfect, but working on increasing water intake.

	•	Other symptoms: I get very drowsy after eating starches, carbs, or sugars, which leads me to avoid them..probably further hurting my metabolism.

Thyroid issues run in my family, but my last check (1.5 years ago) showed everything to be within normal range.

Despite all this, my metabolism feels stuck. I track my food intake diligently and feel like I’m doing all the right things, but the scale won’t budge.

Has anyone been in a similar boat? Are there any supplements, strategies, or even lab tests you’d recommend to help identify what’s holding me back or support recovery from long-term metabolic adaptation?

Thanks in advance, I’d truly appreciate any input.

1k8lgga,Biohackers,25M — LDL and blood sugar a bit high after becoming sedentary. Need advice!,"Hey everyone!
Just wanted to share my situation and get some advice.

I'm 25, 6'1"" (1.85 m), about 210 lbs (95 kg).
I used to be super active — gym, 10k+ steps a day, and I was even a soccer referee.
But... after tearing my ACL and getting stuck studying for my final university exams,
I basically turned into a couch potato for almost a year.

Lately, I’ve been feeling really tired and noticed a bit of a drop in libido, so I got some bloodwork done.


---

Here’s what came back (with the normal ranges):

Fasting glucose: 107 mg/dL (normal 70–99)

Total cholesterol: 214 mg/dL (normal <=190)

LDL: 161 mg/dL (normal <115)

HDL: 55 mg/dL (normal >=40)

Triglycerides: 98 mg/dL (normal <=150)

AST (GOT): 77 U/L (normal <50)

ALT (GPT): 55 U/L (normal <50)

Creatinine: 1.25 mg/dL (normal 0.72–1.18)

eGFR: 81 mL/min (normal >90 is perfect, 60–89 = mild reduction)

Vitamin D: 27.1 µg/L (ideal 30.1–100)

Iron: 63 µg/dL (normal 70–180)

Ferritin: 87.8 µg/L (normal 23.9–336.2)

Total Testosterone: 4.12 µg/L (normal 2.32–12.18)


> Small thing:
I worked out pretty hard the day before my blood test after months of being inactive,
so my AST, ALT, and creatinine might be a bit higher than usual because of muscle breakdown.




---

Game plan for the next 3 months:

Intermittent fasting (16/8)

Clean, slightly calorie-reduced diet (cutting sugars, bad fats, fried food, processed meats)

10,000 steps every day

Bodyweight training 3x a week

Supplements:

Vitamin D3

Omega-3s

Zinc

Magnesium

Psyllium fiber



Then after 3 months I’ll retest everything + add:

Free testosterone

SHBG

LH

FSH
to check the full hormonal picture.



---

Main thing I want to ask:

Does this overall plan sound good to you?

Any extra tips or things you would tweak?

Anyone been through something similar?


Also, thinking about adding:

Berberine (500 mg twice a day) for blood sugar

Red yeast rice (Monacolin K) for LDL


Should I start them now or wait to see what happens just with diet + exercise first?

1k8f8z2,Biohackers,Changes in caffeine metabolism after supplementing?,"36f

I drink the same amount of coffee every day and have been for four months, since I got divorced and no longer split a pot with someone.

I buy the same beans, fill my silly little grinder (short term rental) the same amount, pulse it the same number of times, and fill the French press the same amount.

The last couple weeks, I have had a much harder time falling asleep, my lowest resting heart rate has been up 5-10bpm, my HRV has tanked, and my resilience score on Oura has been in a free fall.

I initially thought it might be seasonal allergies or something with supplementation, so I’ve been tweaking that. Antihistamine made no difference, and neither did taking days off from my stack. I thought I might be overmethylated. 

In mid-March, I started supplementing B vitamins, TMG, and D3/K2 and had a ton of improvement in focus, sleep, and cardio metrics. I added trace minerals a few weeks later, mostly for the zinc, molybdenum, and iodine.
- Thorne Riboflavin 5'-Phosphate (36.5 mg)
- Thorne Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate (33.8 mg)
- Pure Encapsulations Adenosyl/Hydroxy B12 (500 mcg @ 60s)
- TMG (750 mg)
- Thorne D3 (50 mcg) / K2 (400 mcg)
- Pure Encapsulations Trace Minerals

I tried supplementing Magnesium Glycinate for the second time, and it gave me crazy anxiety, again. I am recovering from a panic disorder and tipped me right back into being in a bad place.

I’ve had issues with fat absorption / undigested food, and my general digestion has not been great since my divorce, so I started taking:
- Designs for Health GI Revive (7 capsules in the morning before food)
- Thorne Betaine HCl with Pepsin (2-3g per day)
- Pure Encapsulations Digestive Enzymes Ultra (2 capsules with most meals)

My digestion is WAY BETTER, and I think the enzymes make the biggest difference. I’m so much less hungry and my fat stores (mostly my boobs) are starting to perk up even though I haven’t gained more than a pound or two. I was eating so much food after my divorce but lost a bunch of weight, almost like it went right through me.

I have sort of suspected that I don’t need the heavy B stack now that I seem to be getting more nutrients out of my food. I eat pretty clean, lots of bone broths, vegetables, fruit, liver, mackerel, beans, and grass-fed meat. I have sugar a few times a month, and usually do 18:6 intermittent fasting. The liver has been a newer addition, and it’s my favorite part of the day.

I do Pilates 3-4 times a week. My cardio could use some work — I do an ~8 mile hike on the weekend, usually fasted, and have recently been getting some Zone 4 cardio in by running part of it. I was getting 8-9 hours of sleep a night before things went south, and my lowest nighttime heart rate was 50-55bpm, which was low for me.

My “exceptional” resilience felt pretty well earned and I’ve been so confused about why things have continued to tank.

Two days ago, I ran out of coffee beans — I only had enough to make a half-strength pot. Before lunch, Oura was pinging me to let me know that I’d had much more restorative time than usual. That night, I got almost nine hours of decent sleep.

I was really surprised at how much of a difference it made because my caffeine consumption hasn’t changed in months! I’m going to stick with the half-strength pot and see if it continues to help, but what gives? 

Did changing my digestion change the way I absorb and/or metabolize caffeine? Is this overmethylation? Is my vagus nerve chilled out after my divorce and more sensitive to harsh substances now? Has this ever happened to anyone else?",2025-04-26 15:15:05,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8f8z2

1jqgse3,Biohackers,Why I Find This Study on Hair Aging Fascinating,"I’ve always been curious about why some people keep thick, dark hair well into old age while others start graying and thinning in their 20s or 30s. Most people think it’s just genetics, but this study suggests that hormones and cellular aging play a bigger role than we realize.

The research focused on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone that affects cell growth and aging. What surprised me was that IGF-1, which is usually linked to youth and repair, might actually speed up hair follicle aging when it’s too high in the skin. That made me wonder: Could things we do every day—like our diet and lifestyle—be affecting our IGF-1 levels and how fast our hair ages?


The study found that as mice aged, their skin produced more IGF-1. The same pattern was seen in humans. To see what would happen, researchers genetically engineered mice to have even higher IGF-1 in their skin—and the results were striking:

Their hair turned gray and fell out much faster than normal.

Their hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) stopped working properly, leading to thinning hair.

They showed signs of inflammation and cellular exhaustion, making it harder for the follicles to regenerate.

At first, this felt counterintuitive to me. IGF-1 is usually something we associate with youthfulness and repair—so why was it making hair follicles age faster? It turns out that too much IGF-1 pushes stem cells into overdrive, burning them out before their time.
Once they saw how IGF-1 was accelerating hair follicle aging, the researchers tested ways to slow it down or even reverse it.

Blocking p53 activation via SIRT1 overexpression 

Senolytics

Dietary restriction (eating less to naturally lower IGF-1 levels)

All of these methods restored some stem cell activity and helped prevent further hair loss.


While this study is exciting, there are some big unknowns:

It was done in mice. Human biology is more complex, and IGF-1 affects many different tissues.

We don’t know the best IGF-1 balance. Too much might age hair follicles, but too little can weaken muscles and bones.

Other factors matter too. Stress, inflammation, and nutrition also play major roles in hair health.
 Reading this made me wonder: Am I unknowingly accelerating my own hair aging? If IGF-1 levels in the skin naturally rise with age, could my diet or lifestyle be pushing it even higher?

I looked into science-backed ways to naturally regulate IGF-1 without drugs or genetic modifications, and here’s what I found:

Fasting & Caloric Restriction – Studies show that intermittent fasting and eating fewer overall calories can help lower IGF-1 levels naturally. This could explain why people who eat less tend to age more slowly.

Protein Moderation – IGF-1 spikes when we eat a lot of animal protein (especially dairy). Some researchers believe a more plant-based diet could help regulate it.

Exercise (but not overtraining) – Resistance training keeps IGF-1 balanced, but excessive exercise without recovery can cause spikes that might accelerate aging.

Reducing Sugar & Processed Foods – High insulin levels stimulate IGF-1, so cutting down on sugar may indirectly help prevent premature hair aging.

Stress Management & Sleep – Chronic stress increases inflammation and disrupts IGF-1 signaling, which could be harmful to hair follicles over time.


Before reading this study, I thought hair aging was mostly about genetics. But now, I’m convinced that hormonal balance and lifestyle choices matter just as much. If IGF-1 plays such a big role, then things like fasting, stress reduction, and mindful nutrition might actually help slow down hair loss and graying.

Would I try lowering IGF-1 naturally to protect my hair? Honestly, yes. It’s not about stopping aging altogether, but if small changes in diet and lifestyle can keep hair follicles working longer, that seems worth it to me.

What do you think? Would you tweak your diet or habits if it meant keeping your hair healthier for longer?

1jq45ys,Biohackers,"Consensus on fasting (IF, FMD etc)?","Fingers crossed this isn’t a tribal question, but is there any consensus on what styles of fasting makes sense for general wellness for already healthy people? 

I know that the higher protein advocates like Peter Attia and Rhonda Patrick no longer do extended fasts, but they still recommend things like Intermittent Fasting (12-16 hours daily, or multiple times per week) as a method of caloric control. 

Meanwhile, Vitor Longo and his advocates recommend the periodic Fasting Mimicking Diets (5 days, low protein, under 1k calories per day) as an easier way to get some of the benefits of an extended fast. 

I’m 46M, normal BMI, eat healthy, do IF for 14 hours a few times per week, and an FMD 2x/year. I no longer do 24+ hour fasts, but have done them in the past. I do IF for calorie control, and FMD to lower my IGF periodically…but I wonder if these are productive or not.

1jjo0ie,Biohackers,"Struggling with Low Libido at 37, Elevated SHBG and Prolactin – Looking for Natural Solutions (Type 1 Diabetic)","I'm a 37-year-old man, Type 1 diabetic since the age of 27, and I've recently noticed a significant drop in my libido. Blood tests revealed:

* Total Testosterone: 5.94 ng/mL
* Free Testosterone: 60.3 pmol/L
* SHBG: consistently high (tested three times over several months: 82.6 nmol/L, 85.7 nmol/L, 93.3 nmol/L)
* Prolactin: 336 mUI/L

During sexual activity, I often lose excitement, leading to erection loss, though I still experience nocturnal erections. However, my libido overall is extremely low now.

My current lifestyle includes:

* Strength training twice a week (Heavy Duty Method by Mike Mentzer). I understand this could be taxing on the nervous system, but I allow 3 full days of recovery between sessions.
* Walking approximately 2 hours weekly
* Daily meditation (10-20 mins/day, recent addition)
* Kundalini Yoga for breathing and stress management (I'm naturally stressed)
* Balanced diet rich in animal protein
* Consistent sleep schedule (7-9 hours/night)

Thyroid and liver function tests came back normal, leaving the elevated SHBG and prolactin unexplained. My endocrinologist attributes these symptoms to psychological factors and has offered no further insights. However, I'm convinced there's a physiological aspect given these blood markers.

I've started supplementing Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B complex, and recently added Boron (6mg/day). Previous trials with Maca, Tribulus terrestris, and Ginseng provided no noticeable improvement.

A friend recommended intermittent fasting, specifically OMAD (One Meal a Day), but I'm uncertain if this approach suits my situation.

Life without libido is tough, and I'm feeling lost regarding next steps. I'm committed to finding natural solutions and want to avoid testosterone replacement therapy.

Has anyone successfully lowered elevated SHBG/prolactin naturally? Could intermittent fasting (OMAD) help my case? Any insights or experiences would be greatly appreciated.

1jhe14c,Biohackers,Modulating the Progression: Combined Effects of Magnesium Supplementation and Intermittent Fasting on Tau Hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer’s Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition, often associated with aging and genetic hereditary, where profound modifiable risk factors are still being studied. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with tau protein hyperphosphorylation playing a central role in its pathogenesis. Phosphatases (enzymes that remove phosphate groups from proteins) can counteract tau hyperphosphorylation, potentially slowing disease progression. 

Magnesium has been shown to activate phosphatases and reduce oxidative stress, suggesting it may help regulate tau phosphorylation. Similarly, intermittent fasting (IF) has been found to significantly increase Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in animals, which may further enhance phosphatase activity, particularly protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), involved in tau dephosphorylation. 

A randomized controlled trial will assign participants to one of four groups: a control group, an IF-only group, a magnesium-only group, and a combined magnesium + IF group. Primary outcomes might include changes in hyperphosphorylated tau levels, measured by ELISA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and glucose variability, assessed via continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). 

This study aims to explore the combined effects of magnesium supplementation and IF on tau phosphorylation in individuals with early-stage AD. We hypothesize that it is likely both magnesium and IF, particularly in combination, will result in reduced tau phosphorylation and improved metabolic health. 

Previous studies of magnesium and IF corresponding to AD have been conducted on mice, but the exact correlation of these interventions in humans, their relation to phosphatase activity in TP, and how they complement each other are still yet to be investigated. This research could provide insights into dietary interventions as potential strategies for slowing AD progression.

1jezrnc,Biohackers,Discussion on Epigenetic reprogramming ChatGPT VS DEEPSEEK protocol proposals with common supplements,"I was curious what LLMs/AI would think based on the other post so I ran the table posted yesterday through it so we could have a proper discussion. What is convenient with these substances is that they are all freely available. 

I had separately found a list that includes medications but I think this would be far safer to try. If someone wants to discuss medications as well we can do that also. There are potential ones that are well known that could be used as well.

The lists are a bit different but all the supplements listed are well known.

ChatGPT:

Supplements based on scientific knowledge of epigenetics and commonly known nutraceuticals. Here’s a breakdown of possible candidates for each step:

1. Chromatin Opening (Priming Stage)

HDAC inhibitors (HDACi): Common natural HDAC inhibitors include butyrate (from fiber fermentation), sulforaphane (from cruciferous vegetables), curcumin (from turmeric), and EGCG (from green tea).

2. DNA Demethylation & Epigenetic Remodeling

TET cofactors and activators: Vitamin C (ascorbate) is a well-known TET enzyme cofactor.

DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi): Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea and genistein (from soy) have been studied for DNMT inhibition.

Possible supplements: Vitamin C, EGCG, Genistein.

3. OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 Activation

cAMP boosters: Forskolin (from Coleus forskohlii) is known to increase cAMP levels, which could assist in activating these factors.

Possible supplements: Forskolin.

4. Exit from Reprogramming Phase

DNMT inhibitors/SIRT1 activators: Resveratrol and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) activate SIRT1.

SIRT6 activators: Fisetin and quercetin are known activators.

Possible supplements: Resveratrol, NMN, Fisetin, Quercetin.

5. Stabilization of the Reprogrammed State

mTOR stabilizers and metabolic supporters: Glycine, methionine, folate, or other methyl donors could be involved.

Possible supplements: Glycine, Folate.

Conclusion:

A mix of butyrate, sulforaphane, curcumin, EGCG, vitamin C, forskolin, resveratrol, NMN, fisetin, quercetin, and glycine. These are all accessible nutraceuticals with potential roles in epigenetic modulation.

Below is a hypothetical nutraceutical-based epigenetic rejuvenation protocol, inspired by the table’s mechanistic approach. This follows a cyclic ""on-phase"" (epigenetic remodeling) and ""off-phase"" (stabilization and recovery), similar to published OSK reprogramming strategies.


Epigenetic Rejuvenation Protocol

Cycle: 5 days ""ON"" + 2 days ""OFF"" per week


ON-PHASE (Days 1–5): Epigenetic Reprogramming

Morning (Chromatin Opening & TET Activation)

Butyrate (Sodium Butyrate) – 1-2g (HDAC inhibitor)

Sulforaphane (from Broccoli Sprout Extract) – 10-20mg (HDAC inhibitor)

Curcumin (with Piperine for absorption) – 500-1000mg (HDAC inhibitor, mild DNMT inhibitor)

Vitamin C – 1000mg (TET enzyme cofactor, promotes DNA demethylation)

EGCG (Green Tea Extract) – 200-400mg (DNMT inhibitor)


Midday (Pluripotency Gene Activation)

Forskolin (Coleus forskohlii extract, 10% forskolin) – 25-50mg (cAMP booster for OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 activation)


Evening (Exit from Reprogramming & Chromatin Stability)

Resveratrol – 250-500mg (SIRT1 activator, longevity pathway)

NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide) – 250-500mg (boosts NAD+, supports SIRT1/2/3)

Fisetin – 100-200mg (SIRT6 activator, senolytic)

Quercetin – 500mg (SIRT6 activator, anti-inflammatory)


OFF-PHASE (Days 6–7): Stabilization & Recovery

Glycine – 2-5g (methylation balance, collagen synthesis)

Folate (Methylfolate or 5-MTHF) – 400-800mcg (one-carbon metabolism, supports methylation balance)

Methionine (if needed) – 500mg (replenishes methyl donors)

Protein-rich diet – Supports metabolic recovery

Light fasting (optional) – To enhance metabolic and autophagic reset

Additional Notes:

This protocol cycles the reprogramming phase to avoid continuous demethylation, which may cause instability.

Adjust dosages based on tolerance and body response.

Can be combined with intermittent fasting for enhanced effects on longevity pathways.

Exercise & sleep optimization are crucial for full benefits.


DEEPSEEK 

The table you provided compares a nutraceutical-based approach to epigenetic reprogramming with published OSK (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4) studies. The names of supplements in the table are likely replaced with placeholders like ""(TET cofactor)"", ""(TET activator)"", ""(DNMTi)"", etc. 

1. **TET Cofactor**: This could be **Vitamin C** (ascorbic acid), which is known to enhance TET enzyme activity, promoting DNA demethylation.

2. **TET Activator**: This might refer to **Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG)**, a metabolite that supports TET enzyme function.

3. **DNMTi (DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor)**: Common natural DNMT inhibitors include **Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG)** from green tea and **Curcumin** from turmeric.

4. **OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 Activators**: These could be natural compounds like **Resveratrol** or **Quercetin**, which have been shown to upregulate pluripotency genes gently.

5. **SIRT1/SIRT6 Activators**: **Resveratrol** is a well-known activator of SIRT1, and **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)** or **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN)** could be involved in activating SIRT6.

These supplements are commonly available and have been studied for their roles in epigenetic regulation and cellular rejuvenation. However, the exact identities would depend on the specific protocol used in the study.

Creating a protocol for epigenetic reprogramming using commonly available supplements requires careful consideration of dosages, timing, and potential interactions. Below is a proposed daily and weekly protocol based on the substances mentioned:

### Daily Protocol

#### Morning:
- **Vitamin C (TET Cofactor)**: 500-1000 mg
  - Enhances TET enzyme activity for DNA demethylation.
- **Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG) (TET Activator)**: 500-1000 mg
  - Supports TET enzyme function.
- **Resveratrol (SIRT1 Activator)**: 250-500 mg
  - Activates SIRT1, promoting DNA repair and chromatin stability.

#### Midday:
- **Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) (DNMTi)**: 400-500 mg
  - Inhibits DNA methyltransferases, preventing remethylation.
- **Curcumin (DNMTi)**: 500-1000 mg
  - Another natural DNMT inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties.

#### Evening:
- **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) or Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) (SIRT6 Activator)**: 250-500 mg
  - Supports SIRT6 activation, promoting DNA repair and metabolic health.
- **Quercetin (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 Activator)**: 500-1000 mg
  - Gently upregulates pluripotency genes.

### Weekly Protocol

#### Monday to Friday:
- Follow the daily protocol as outlined above.

#### Saturday and Sunday:
- **Rest Days**: Reduce the dosage of all supplements by half or take a complete break to allow the body to reset and avoid potential overstimulation.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Hydration**: Ensure adequate water intake to support detoxification and metabolic processes.
- **Diet**: Maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole foods to support overall health and supplement efficacy.
- **Exercise**: Incorporate regular physical activity to enhance cellular health and epigenetic regulation.
- **Sleep**: Prioritize quality sleep to support DNA repair and overall well-being.

### Monitoring and Adjustments:
- **Consultation**: Regularly consult with a healthcare provider to monitor health markers and adjust dosages as needed.
- **Blood Tests**: Periodic blood tests to check for any imbalances or deficiencies.

1jc188i,Biohackers,Can a Natural Compound from Rhubarb Slow Down Aging?,"Aging is a natural process, but it comes with increased risks of diseases like heart conditions, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Scientists are constantly exploring ways to slow aging and improve health in later years. A promising discovery suggests that **Chrysophanol (Chr), a compound found in rhubarb, may help extend lifespan and delay age-related diseases** by influencing a key biological pathway.

# The Science Behind Chrysophanol and Aging

Researchers tested Chrysophanol on tiny worms (*Caenorhabditis elegans*), naturally aging mice, and mice that experienced accelerated aging due to stress. In all cases, **Chr activated the Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway**, a crucial regulator of lifespan and aging. The results were notable:

* **Lifespan Extension:** Subjects lived longer and remained healthier.
* **Reduced Inflammation:** Aging cells release harmful substances (senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, or SASPs) that accelerate disease progression. Chr helped suppress these.
* **Enhanced Antioxidant Defense:** Chr increased the activity of genes responsible for protecting cells from oxidative damage, a key factor in aging.

# What This Means for You

While these studies were conducted in worms and mice, they highlight the potential of Chrysophanol as an anti-aging compound. More research is needed before it can be recommended as a supplement, but its effects align with well-established aging mechanisms.

# How to Support Healthy Aging Now

1. **Incorporate Polyphenol-Rich Foods** – Rhubarb, berries, turmeric, and green tea contain compounds that support cellular health.
2. **Optimize Insulin Signaling Naturally** – Regular exercise, intermittent fasting, and a low-sugar diet can help regulate the same pathway that Chrysophanol influences.
3. **Stay Informed on Anti-Aging Research** – As studies progress, Chrysophanol and similar compounds may become available as targeted interventions for longevity.

Aging is inevitable, but slowing its effects is possible. The more we understand these mechanisms, the better we can take control of our health in the long run.

1j3k7cl,Biohackers,"Intermittent fasting, keto cycling, and body recomposition","So I'm trying to get started on the keto diet, but I was never too enthusiastic about it for 2 main reasons. First of all it's too restrictive, but then I found out about keto cycling where I go keto for a number of days a week and then stick with a regular but still healthy diet the rest of the week. However, the second reason is more important for me. Body recomposition. 

Weight wise, I'm close to my ideal weight, I just have a lot of excess fat, so I'm trying body recomposition where I can burn fat while building muscle at the same time. But this requires a diet that focuses a lot on protein intake as well as controlling the amount of calories you're eating. I can't deny the benefits of the keto diet, but it's not specialized for muscle building or atheltic performance, as far as I know. So, I'm wondering if there is a way to alter the keto diet into one that ups the protein intake or one that's specialized for athletic performance. Or is it not possible to do both at the same time?

This brings me to intermittent fasting. Now, I've had some past experience about fasting, but due to my schedule, I never managed to keep it up for long. Now, I'm at a point where it's easier for me, but I have a question. Usually, I break my fast between 11 and 11:30, and start back up between around 7 and 7:30. There are some days I break fasting the moment the clock turns 11 and I stop eating at around 7:30, some days its the reverse where i dont eat until its closer to 11:30 and stop eating at 7. Will doing this disrupt my fasting schedule? Also, am I allowed days where I don't fast? It's easy on the weekdays, but harder on the weekends.

I am just looking for some advice on what I can do to improve and make this whole process more efficient.",2025-03-04 20:09:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1j3k7cl/intermittent_fasting_keto_cycling_and_body/

1itqctr,Biohackers,Is Moderate (letsmoderate.com) the Real Deal or Just Hype? A Critical Analysis,"
Recently, I came across Moderate (GlubLoc™) on Shark Tank India, a product claiming to reduce glucose and insulin spikes by up to 40% via α-glucosidase inhibition. As a specialist in biohacking, nutrition science, and lifestyle medicine, I decided to analyze these claims with a scientific lens.

Does It Work? The Science Behind It

GlubLoc™ contains White Mulberry Leaf Extract & Green Apple Peel Extract, which theoretically may slow carbohydrate absorption by inhibiting α-glucosidase. But how strong is this effect?
	•	White Mulberry (Morus alba): Contains 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), a mild α-glucosidase inhibitor. However, pharmaceutical alternatives like Acarbose have stronger evidence, reducing postprandial glucose by ~25-30%.
	•	Green Apple Peel Extract: Rich in polyphenols and fiber, which may slow glucose absorption, but robust evidence for direct enzymatic inhibition at the claimed magnitude is lacking.

While the mechanism is plausible, the magnitude of effect remains unclear without further independent validation.

The 40% Reduction Claim – Where’s the Data?

The marketing highlights an AIIMS-backed study, but currently, publicly available, peer-reviewed data from AIIMS or other high-impact sources is missing.

Key questions remain:
✅ Is the 40% reduction absolute or relative?
✅ Was the effect uniform across participants?
✅ Was it compared to other interventions or just a high-carb diet baseline?

Until these questions are clarified through transparent data, such claims should be interpreted cautiously.

Better Alternatives for Biohackers & Metabolic Health

For those optimizing glycemic control, stronger evidence exists for:
✅ Berberine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Inositol, Metformin – Backed by multiple RCTs.
✅ Carb cycling, targeted ketogenic diets, intermittent fasting – Proven metabolic strategies.
✅ Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) – Personalized real-time glucose insights.

Who Might Benefit? Who Won’t?

✅ Mildly glucose-intolerant individuals and 

 A person on high-carb diet might see minor improvements but they too have scientifically superior alternatives exist. Carb cycling, intermittent fasting, fiber preloading, and targeted ketogenic approaches provide better glycemic control, while nutraceuticals like berberine, alpha-lipoic acid, and inositol have stronger evidence supporting their efficacy.

❌ Diabetics – Unlikely to match pharmaceuticals like Metformin, Acarbose, or SGLT-2 inhibitors.
❌ Keto/Low-Carb Diet Followers – Minimal benefit if carb intake is already low.
❌ Athletes & Physically Active Individuals – No proven impact on performance or recovery.

Final Thoughts: Transparency Needed

GlubLoc™ may have a role in mild glycemic control, but stronger alternatives exist. Without full transparency on the clinical data, consumers should make informed decisions.

I’d love to see public access to the full AIIMS study, along with independent replications, before making strong metabolic claims.

What do you think? Do you believe the hype, or do we need more data? Let’s discuss!

1inix4x,Biohackers,Strange symptoms,"I recently started getting symptoms of cold sensitivity especially cold hands/feet, redness around lips/dry lips, fatigue, frequent infections, eye twitches, mild nausea, hair thinning, occasional nocturia once a night, brain fog, foamy urine. 

It’s odd because I eat a very clean animal-based diet, exercise regularly. I am in the best physical shape I’ve ever been but have these symptoms. I do intermittent fasting and eat a whole food diet with high quality protein. I rarely have any stimulants such as coffee/tea. Sleep quality could be better. Is there something I’m missing?

Introduction

The quest to slow—or even reverse—human aging has moved from science fiction to rigorous biomedical research. Scientists are now uncovering the fundamental causes of aging and testing interventions aimed at extending not only lifespan but also “healthspan,” the period of life spent in good health. This report outlines key scientific breakthroughs, major players in longevity research, promising treatments, and the potential societal impacts of radically extended healthy lifespans.

Current Leading Research in Longevity
	•	Epigenetic Reprogramming:
Research at Harvard shows that age‐related epigenetic changes—not just mutations—drive aging in mice. A 2023 study demonstrated that restoring lost epigenetic information can reverse aging symptoms. A “chemical cocktail” of six molecules has rejuvenated human cells in the lab, hinting at a non–gene therapy approach to whole‐body rejuvenation.
	•	Cellular Senescence (“Zombie Cells”):
The accumulation of senescent cells, which no longer divide but secrete harmful inflammatory factors, is a hallmark of aging. Studies at the Mayo Clinic showed that drugs (senolytics) clearing these cells extended healthy lifespan in mice, supporting the concept that eliminating toxic cells can rejuvenate tissues.
	•	Stem Cell & Regenerative Research:
Declining stem cell function contributes to tissue aging. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies, which promote tissue repair and reduce inflammation, are under clinical investigation for age-related frailty. Renewing or replacing aged stem cells could restore organ function and overall vitality.
	•	Caloric Restriction & Metabolism:
Decades of research confirm that calorie restriction can extend lifespan in animals. Recent trials (e.g., CALERIE) indicate that even a modest 12% reduction in calories slows biological aging markers in humans, likely by reducing inflammation and the burden of senescent cells.
	•	Other Emerging Findings:
New discoveries—such as the age-associated decline of molecules like taurine—offer fresh targets. Experiments with young blood plasma suggest that factors in youthful blood can rejuvenate older tissues, although human applications remain experimental.

Key Biotech Companies & Institutions in Aging Research
	•	Altos Labs:
Launched in 2022 with around $3 billion in funding from high-profile investors (e.g., Jeff Bezos), Altos Labs focuses on in vivo cellular reprogramming. By harnessing the Yamanaka factors to reset adult cells, the company hopes to restore youthful tissue function.
	•	Calico Life Sciences:
Founded by Alphabet’s Google in 2013 (with over $1.5 billion in funding in partnership with AbbVie), Calico investigates the basic biology of aging. Although secretive, Calico’s work in identifying longevity genes and developing novel screening technologies underscores a “big science” approach to aging.
	•	Unity Biotechnology:
One of the first startups to target senescent cells, Unity—founded by pioneers from the Mayo Clinic and Buck Institute—has raised over $100 million. After early trials in osteoarthritis, Unity shifted focus to eye diseases, where its senolytic drug UBX1325 has shown promising Phase 2 results.
	•	Other Players:
A vibrant ecosystem includes companies such as Resilience, BioAge, Juvenescence, Retro Biosciences, and NewLimit (co-founded by Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong). Nonprofits like the SENS Research Foundation and academic centers (e.g., Buck Institute, Harvard, Stanford) also drive research. National and international funding bodies (like the NIH’s NIA and Japan’s RIKEN) support large-scale longevity projects.

Promising Anti-Aging Treatments & Therapies
	•	Senolytic Drugs:
These compounds target and eliminate senescent cells. Preclinical studies using agents like Dasatinib + Quercetin have extended lifespan and improved physical function in mice. Early human trials (including those at the Mayo Clinic) are underway, with the first senolytic therapies for age-related diseases possibly reaching patients in the near future.
	•	Gene Therapy & Epigenetic Reprogramming:
A landmark 2020 study used viral delivery of three Yamanaka genes (OSK) to reprogram retinal cells in mice, restoring vision and youthful gene expression. Additional approaches target telomeres to extend cell longevity. Although these therapies remain in early stages due to safety concerns (e.g., potential tumor risk), they represent a high-reward frontier that may redefine aging medicine within 5–10 years.
	•	Stem Cell Therapies:
Clinical trials are investigating infusions of MSCs to regenerate aging tissues and improve immune function. Organ-specific applications (such as cardiac or neural stem cells) are also being explored. While promising, these therapies require more data to establish long-term efficacy and safety.
	•	NAD+ Boosters (NMN, NR):
NAD+ is essential for cellular metabolism and DNA repair but declines with age. Studies led by researchers like David Sinclair indicate that NAD+ precursors improve mitochondrial function and muscle endurance in animal models—and early human trials have shown improvements in metabolic health. NAD boosters are already on the market as supplements, though regulatory clarity is pending.
	•	Metformin:
A decades-old diabetes drug, metformin has been associated with increased lifespan in epidemiological studies. The ongoing TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) Trial aims to determine whether metformin can delay chronic diseases. Its extensive safety record and low cost make it a strong candidate for near-term anti-aging use.
	•	Rapamycin & mTOR Inhibitors:
By inhibiting the mTOR pathway—a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism—rapamycin has produced some of the most robust lifespan extensions in animal studies. Trials in pet dogs and humans are exploring its potential to boost immune function and extend healthspan, although side effects (e.g., mouth ulcers, dyslipidemia) require careful dosing strategies.
	•	Additional Interventions:
Other promising therapies include:
	•	AKG (Alpha-ketoglutarate): A metabolite shown to extend healthspan in mice.
	•	Fisetin & Quercetin: Plant polyphenols with senolytic properties.
	•	Hormone Modulation: Re-assessing hormones like thyroid or sex hormones in the context of healthy aging.
	•	Dietary Interventions: Fasting protocols (e.g., intermittent fasting) improve metabolic markers.
	•	Young Blood Factors & Plasma Exchange: Experimental approaches suggest that factors in young blood can rejuvenate tissues, though human applications remain unproven.

Economic and Ethical Implications
	•	Economic Impact (“Longevity Dividend”):
Extending healthy lifespan could transform retirement, workforce dynamics, and healthcare spending. A one-year increase in healthy life is estimated to yield tens of trillions in economic gains through increased productivity and reduced disease burden. However, longer lifespans may stress pension systems and require policy reforms (e.g., adjustments in retirement ages and workforce participation).
	•	Healthcare & Society:
A shift toward preventive geroscience—treating aging as the root cause of many diseases—could lower long-term healthcare costs if morbidity is compressed. At the same time, society must adapt to increased numbers of active elderly citizens, potentially reshaping housing, transportation, and social roles.
	•	Ethical & Philosophical Considerations:
Key concerns include:
	•	Equitable Access: High initial costs may limit treatments to the wealthy, deepening inequality.
	•	“Naturalness”: Many question whether radically extending life is “unnatural” or interferes with the natural order.
	•	Psychological/Social Effects: Longer lifespans raise questions about relationships, career dynamics, and the potential for societal stagnation if leadership remains concentrated among older generations.
	•	Resource Allocation: Policymakers must balance funding between anti-aging research and other societal needs.

Feasibility and Timeline for Anti-Aging Therapies
	•	Near-Term (Now–5 Years):
Existing interventions (metformin, lifestyle modifications, NAD boosters) are already in use. The next few years may bring the first approved senolytic therapies or repurposed drugs (e.g., rapamycin derivatives) for age-related conditions.
	•	Medium-Term (5–10 Years):
The early 2030s could see first-generation longevity drugs for broader populations. Potential developments include refined senolytics, improved NAD booster formulations, and initial organ-targeted gene or stem cell therapies.
	•	Long-Term (10+ Years):
Radical interventions—such as whole-body epigenetic reprogramming or multi-gene therapies—remain further out (possibly the 2040s or beyond). Despite these challenges, rapid progress and increasing research investments suggest that significant extensions of healthy life are increasingly feasible.
	•	Expert Predictions & Challenges:
While some visionaries (e.g., Aubrey de Grey) envision “longevity escape velocity” and extreme life extension, mainstream projections remain modest. Key hurdles include regulatory recognition of aging as a treatable condition, proving long-term safety, and developing reliable biomarkers to quickly assess treatment efficacy.

Conclusion

Longevity science is rapidly evolving from theory to practice. Advances in epigenetics, senolytics, gene therapy, and regenerative medicine have demonstrated that aging is not an unchangeable fate. With increasing investment from biotech firms, academic institutions, and high-profile investors, we may soon see the first wave of anti-aging therapies—initially targeting specific age-related conditions—that could eventually redefine aging as a manageable condition. While profound economic, ethical, and social questions remain, the potential benefits of extending healthy human life are enormous. Over the coming decades, incremental breakthroughs may lead to a future where aging itself becomes a treatable disease, transforming individual lives and society as a whole.

1id4u58,Biohackers,Extreme biohacking,"Hi all, new to the sub and my first post 😁

I've been into supplements for as long as I can remember, and intermittent fasting since 2017 (with 3-6 day water fasts every few months).

Some friends and colleagues view water fasting as pretty extreme, and I'd be interested to hear about the lengths members of this sub have gone to in the pursuit of health/longevity. 

For me, it was a 40 day juice fast, which consisted of 3 litres of juiced organic fruit and vegetables per day, in addition to a bowl of vegetable broth and a bowl of miso soup. I also took a daily electrolyte supplement.

I lost 1 1/2 stone,  skin was clear and soft, and the most unexpected result was the heightening of all my senses.

I felt absolutely amazing after I finished, and my first solid meal tasted absolutely unbelievable. 

Not sure I'd do it again though!

1i7ktgy,Biohackers,Weight loss stuck,"I put thought into where to post this. The precision and science that I think is most involved makes me think this group might know better than weight loss groups, or hashimotos groups (they’ve gotten angry at me when I propose intermittent fasting, etc)

So I have mild hashimotos. I have a few pounds to lose. I’m 42F. Recently I had my resting metabolic rate tested and I’m (apparently) burning 2200 calories a day at rest. That shocked me - I can’t rule out that that’s wrong. But I do work out every day in the morning  (Pilates, power yoga). My meals are low carb, gluten and dairy free. Usually very caveman esque. Hearty sweet potato and lentil soup, salad with lots of protein and good fats, salmon, etc. Coffee, water. Alcohol twice a week is kind of my only indulgence. No sugar( aside from that)

Generally my weight just feels stuck. There’s really nothing else I can do. I probably only have a few pounds to lose. I feel like the solution is more of a hack than anything. 

Example, I’ve been on AIP before and weight just drops off me, even with barely working out.So something about having an autoimmune disease might make the system more sluggish. (I am on synthroid btw). Also have GERD and IBS. 

The answer is probably weight training. I do a bit of it in fitness classes but should probably do more. 

Anything else I’m missing? ",2025-01-22 20:18:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1i7ktgy/weight_loss_stuck/
1i5e9ek,Biohackers,What have you tried to help you lose weight but didn’t work at all or couldn’t sustain?,"Either it just didn’t work or you couldn’t keep it up/sustain it

Here are mine:

— Green tea. I drink tons of matcha every day for my ADHD, been doing it for past 2 months, but so far no effect on weight loss. Works great for focus and mood however. 

— Keto. I lost 10 pounds but I love food too much and didn’t just want to eat meat and fat all the time. Felt deprived so I stopped and gained the weight back.

—Calorie counting. Lost 5 pounds. Got frustrated and kept counting wrong, was always hungry and tired, kept trying to cheat, and gave up.

—Taking supplements like ALCAR, CLA, berberine, probiotics, inositol. Didn’t work. Berberine even made me nauseous. Forskolin had promise but it gave me hot flashes and insomnia so I got scared to take anymore. Inositol works for mood but no weight loss so far.

—Vyvanse, been on it for 2 months, but my appetite has not changed so this hasn’t done much.

—Adderall, this actually worked better for me and killed my cravings but had to stop due to side effects like clenching, anxiety, and insomnia. Made me into a numb robot. Also rebound weight gain when stopping was bad.

—Weight lifting, anaerobic exercise. I liked this. I gained muscle but didn’t diet and still had tons of pudge around my muscles. I just looked thicker, stocky, and not as squishy.

—HIIT, I am aerobic exercised intolerant and hated every second of it. I would be in a lot of pain/stress and would go find food after to reward myself. I even had a personal trainer to motivate me every time and I just hated it. It was counter productive.

What definitely worked and was decently enjoyable:

—Intermittent fasting. I was fasting 20 hours a day at a time and would even forget to eat. No cravings. Saved a lot of time from trying to find/cook food.

—Mindlessly eating tons of vegetables before any junk food to pad the junk absorption and increase nutrients. It was good because I still got to eat junk food after (although the vegetables made me full so I only ate half as much).

What works but couldn’t sustain it due to bad habits or poor time management (classic adhd lol):

—Walking 10k steps a day (tread mill or outside)

—Getting 8 hours of sleep a night",2025-01-20 01:01:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1i5e9ek/what_have_you_tried_to_help_you_lose_weight_but/
1i3rqai,Biohackers,Acid reflux support group ,"I made a comment around Christmas eve when I was laying down for bed that was really well received (even received awards from you guys) and people were asking me to expand upon my story, so here it is. I actually would blow it off, but I'd see more people posting about acid reflux and heartburn and feel guilty about not sharing my story so kept on with my rough drafts.  Sorry it took so long! Haven't written anything this long since high school. This is how I fixed mine. It might not work for everyone but this is my story and how my way worked for me. I operated this into 4 parts 
1. Torture porn
2. Failed hospital visits and things they tried
3. What finally worked for me
4. Afterword. 

** torture porn** skip ahead of you don't care to read suffering for years😆 **

Growing up i was always in great shape and always playing sports so never really gave much thought to my habits. Since I was already performing well, I basically thought I could get away with whatever I wanted and out train my health choices. Basically, everything unhealthy, I did it a lot (pop, cereal, sweets, alchohal, weed smoking). And every thing considered healthy besides sports and working out, I never did. When I was around a junior in high school, I started getting acid reflux. This lead to me starting to eat tums. And that lead to me eating more and more tums. Eventually I was eating over a bottle a day. I kept 3 bottles at all times, 1 at home, 1 in my school locker, and 1 in my car. This was the worse thing I could have done. Temporary relief and long term damage. Eventually they quit working. 

This is where it started getting bad. I started throwing up straight stomach bile. And started not being able to eat. And when I could get anything going out the other end, same story, nothing but stomach bile. Sometimes it would come out and it would still be sizzling and bubbling. I can still hear the sounds to this day. I used to keep a giant bucket next to my bed and pitch it out my window and fill it up again. Multiple times a day!

-1 thing that always gave me relief during these times was water. Steaming hot showers! Or being in a pool or a hot tub. I was in water for more than half of my days. I remember my dad getting super pissed during these times saying ""you're gonna run the fucking well dry!"" 

-when i would sleep the only way I could sleep was sitting up with a stack of 5 pillows on my lap with me laying my head on them, kind of like a kid sleeping at his desk at school. Didn't work that well. I started having night terrors when I could sleep too. Sometimes even suffering sleep paralysis where I would be stuck in between sleeping and awake. I could hear everything going on around me but couldn't move. I remember vividly one time listening to a few episodes of sport center on repeat and the episode was nothing but gossip about when tiger woods wife smashed his car in with a golf club 😄 🤣 pure hell. This has not happened ever again since curing this.

-another weird thing that started happening to me was tingly hands and feet. At random times sometimes my hands and feet would just start tingling to the extreme. To the point where my hands and feet would almost go numb.

-extreme sweating. When I would get tingle fits I'd beco,e drenched in sweat. And if I could sleep I'd wake up and my sheets would be drenched in sweat. 

-extreme weight loss and weight gain. I was always a big fit guy always around 220 and in great shape for wrestling and football. When this happened, in periods where I couldn't eat I'd go down to 170 (5th grade wight) then in small periods where I could eat I would balloon up to almost 300 lbs. 

-I couldn't go to school anymore. By this time it was senior year and when I left for spring break, I never came back to school. Thankfully they knew my situation and let me do my work from home and my sister and her friends did all my work for me so I could graduate cause I was useless as a person 



***hospital visits and things they thought and tried***

I was in and out of hospitals during these times where they would run tests, say everything is fine, give me IVs until I felt somewhat OK and then they'd send me home. I'd be back a week later to see them again. Eventually they started running more and more tests on me. 

-I had 3 scopes. Throat was always sore as hell afterwards. They would tell me how ""shredded"" my throat was but offer no solutions and send me off to someone else

-they sent me to a psyciatrists who thought i was going crazy at 1 point and ordered a mri on my brain even. This hurt me so bad because I couldn't lay down to even sleep, laying down hurt me greatly and being stuck in that machine laying down for that long almost did drive me crazy lol he tried prescribing me Xanax to fix it lol

-they thought I had sleep apnea and gave me a cpap mask. No use. 

-they thought I might have cancer and ordered every blood test under the sun. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

-one time I got sent to Cleveland clinic so they could try to figure out what was wrong and this was when I was at my heaviest. They thiignt this was all just because i was fat at this point and wanted to give me a lap band. I almost got it and backed out the day of because it didn't feel right to me. One thing this trip did was shock me into working out again no matter how bad i felt. cause when I got on the scale and it said 298 I was in shock. 

-I destroyed my gall bladder. They said it was so full of sludge that I was at risk of losing my life if I didn't remove it. I thought this would fix me but it didn't. After a few weeks I was right back in the same spot.

- i was prescribed every single antacid this country would legally allow (prilosec, zantac, pepcid, prilosec, etc etc. ) these were all useless which is why they didn't think it was even possible it could be acid reflux. 



**where I turned the corner and how I fixed it for good** 


Since I quit going to school and I couldt work I'd be home 24/7 and at this time my area didn't have high speed internet or DVR so you watched whatever was on TV 😄  I was watching TV like an old man I became a fan of the price is right. One day after drew Carey signed off Dr oz came on. And he had this guy jonathan eviv on pitching his book 

The Mysteries & Dangers Of Acid Reflux And Its Connection To America's Fastest Growing Cancer With A Diet That May Save Your Life
https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Softly-Inside-Mysteries-Connection/dp/1494761971
I hate to make this post seem like a shill for the book and I know Dr oz is a fucko but I'll never say anything bad about him because this book seriously saved my life. 

My main takeaways from the book that I followed religiously 

-cut out the 3 Cs. Candy, Cola, and cake. This is what he called a ""non negotiable"" no 3 Cs at all no matter what 

-eat high PH foods and do not eat anything under 5 PH. The things I gravitated towards was eggs for breakfast. Watermelon and bananas were my fruit. kale and spinach were my vegatables. And fish, crab, and turkey for protein. 

-no deep fried or processed foods 

-no alchohol


Things I did on my own
- I got really into breath work. I think the shallow breaths could have potentially been a small factor in all this too. 

-I started intermittent fasting. I quit eating every day around 4 or 5. And I've done somewhere for over 2000 days in a row. This was something I did on my own that helped tremendously I feel. 

-I do enjoy indulging in the marijuana. But when I came back to smoking after all this I didn't smoke at all. I only vaped. And I'm not talking shitty vape liquid pens. I'm talking real vapor. I used the volcano and ingested nothing but pure thc vapor. This saved me money and it saved my health. Healthiest way to smoke by far (I repeat, NOT SHITTY VAPE PENS! REAL THC VAPOR)

I followed this plan so religiously that it wasn't a plan it was my life. And eventually I realized that I completely cured it. Now these days I even sweets on cheat days and hot sauce and I never get acid reflux for the most part. Sometimes I do get it a little bit and I get paranoid that this dark period in my life could come back. Almost like PTSD 
If I do get it I do 3 things 

-sleep on my left side 

-eat a little bit of bobs mill baking soda. I used to use regular baking soda and it worked but I got paranoid about the metals. Both work though. When I was going to multiple different hospitals facilitys and doctors I met this one hippy doctor (rode a Harley to work type 😆) who was one of the only people that helped me from the Healthcare industry, when he treated me one time he told me that all acid reflux pills are nothing but mostly baking soda with a pinch of there patented ingredient in it) the way I do this is I put a little handful on my palm lick it up and chase it with water. You'll know it works cause you'll burp up really hot air almost immediately!

-follow the original protocol for a day or 2 (no 3 Cs, high ph food, etc)

**afterword**
Sorry for the long post but im super passionate about this and sorry if it was a little jumpy. I was trying to fit in as much as possible while still keeping it short. Over the years I've met a lot of people that dealt with the same shit and it was like being in an acid reflux support group I'd be finishing their sentences for them and we'd be talking about how the Healthcare system did absolutely nothing for us. I'd ask them about super hot showers or tingly hands or if they had a gallbladder and they'd be like wow how'd you know? Same exact shit happened to me.

not to sound dramatic but I often wonder how many people are on this path and never got the help they needed and got throat cancer and didn't survive or are still struggling wondering if they're gonna die or wondering if they have a different cancer or if they are going crazy. Or how many people lost it all cause they couldn't work or function anymore. 

 So if this post helps just 1 person get through this ill be super happy. Feel free to ask questions or share what worked for you so other people that might stumble across this can see other ideas that might help them too

1hvqzv5,Biohackers,my routine for ADHD and studying,"*I wrote this text some months ago on another sub, maybe someone is interested in it (at the end of the post i have an* ***update*** *on what i tried since then):*

**TL;DR: my daily routine:**  
wakeup > easy workout with hometrainer > contrast showering > around 11am supplements (L Tyrosine, and others. see below) and first meal > (university, weight training, 2nd meal at 19 o'clock) > supplement before sleep (L Tryptophan) > good sleep

**main:**

* **1) workout:** **a)** i am starting the day with an **easy workout (max 30 minutes)** at home with my hometrainer (stepper/bike). When i was in school, i was always driving from home to school with a bike. School was much easier after this, i was so much more relaxed (before i did this, it usually felt like that i was FORCED to sit quietly on a chair. But i couldnt) and my focus was great. (or you can go for a walk instead) **b)** after my morning workout i do **contrast shower**: 30 seconds warm then 30 seconds cold for 3 times and ending the shower with warm/hot water. I used to 'only cold' shower but contrast shower is way more relaxing. **c)** others: i do weight training later. Its not that important, but still relaxing and improves my sleep quality a little.
* **2) diet:** **a)** normally i would be extremly tired after the first meal, but since i started **Low Carb/Keto** i have much more energy and dont want to sleep immediately after eating. Its great! If u low carb, its important to consume good fats - some studies have shown that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA and DHA, can reduce symptoms of ADHD. **b)** no coffee: **gut health** is so important for ppl with ADHD, and i noticed that drinking coffee makes me extremly depressed, anxious and is so bad for my gut health since it acidifies my gut. Maybe it works for u but the key point here is: **Listen to your gut!** **c) alcohol & sugar is bad**: Its commonly known that ppl with ADHD have a lower dopamine level and they tend to eat too much sugar because of it since it increases your dopamine levels. But surprise, its bad for your body and health lol. If u r doing low carb, u r not allowed to consume too much sugar anyways. **Supplements can help** here! \[**see 3) supplements a)** L-Tyrosine/ L-Phenylalanine\]. **d**) others: I do intermittent fasting (16/8), i start my meals with vegetables (+ added oil) and then i eat eggs, meat or anything else. and i wait atleast 30 minutes before i drink after the meal for better digestion.
* **3) supplements:** Have your blood tested (!) and talk to your doc before u take anything - especially if u r already on meds! **a) L-Tyrosine/ L-Phenylalanine** (for dopamine): Since L-Tyrosine is synthesized from L-Phenylalanine, u can buy **one** of those and it helps to improve your dopamine levels (+ your focus and attention). Like i already mentioned, people who have ADHD have lower dopamine levels, and Tyrosine/Phenyl. helps! It even helped me to consume less sugar. (*site note*: *Some people may respond better to L-tyrosine, while others may respond better to L-phenylalanine)* **b) L- Tryptophan/ 5-HTP** (for serotonin): Tryptophan converts in the body to 5-HTP, which is why u only need **one** of both. I take it to have a balance between dopamine and serotonin, and especially because it improves my sleep quality a lot! (i cant wake up with my alarm clock if i dont take L Tryptophan. yikes) **c) vitamine B complex, vitamine D:** some studies have shown that ppl with ADHD have a lower level of vitamine B and D. I am taking it but dont have any significant improvements - but they are essential for your body anyways. Healthy diet should be enough. **d)** others: usually **Ginkgo Biloba** helps ppl with ADHD, it did not help me. I take **ashwagandha** and it is relaxing and helping me! I took **L'Theanine** after Huberman suggested it for better sleep (no significant improvement. L Trypto works better for me). Sometimes i supplement with coffein, instead of drinking coffee.
* **4) daily help, things that will/can help, things i personally want to implement, etc:** **a)** u know this feeling that u have 10 things in mind u need to do and u cant focus on your work because its in your head the whole time. Writing it down (big) on paper or on a **whiteboard** helps a lot to eliminate those thoughts. **b)** meditation: studies have shown that meditation has a huge impact on ADHD. I am not meditating yet, but i really want to start! '**mindfulness meditation**' is highly recommended for ppl with ADHD! **c)** to keep my focus while studying, i take a break after 1 to 1.5 hours AND do NSDR (non- sleep deep rest) (see youtube). It is similar to mindfulness meditation, and its great. Try it! **d)** be creative and make boring/necessary things interesting for YOU. For example: I personally dont like going for a walk or hiking - it is just too boring. I started to hunt eatable mushrooms. It is a great, relaxing hobby of mine - and i save money. For me it is like Pokemon Go, u really dont know what u find lol. **e)** interesting too: glutamate diet (""some studies have reported that there are lower levels of glutamate in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with ADHD""),...

In the end, listen to your body what works the best for you. Ppl use to think that ADHD is a desease but for me personally it is only a desease if i dont know how to handle it. Most of us are more creative than ""normal"" ppl. Maybe it is even a strength.  
**If u have more/other interesting points u think are important, then pls share them with me!**

**What supplements i tried since then:**  
\- Ginkgo Biloba: worsened my symptoms (more brain fog). tried 2 different brands  
\- Ginseng: nice relaxing effect but made me too horny lol  
\- Rhodiola Rosea: really good against my symptoms. maybe even better then LTyrosine  
\- others with no special effect: Tribulus, NAC

**Current (new) stack:**  
Rhodiola Rosea (for adhd), Safran (for better mood), Astaxanthin (""healthier"" skin color), Bor (Boroganic Glycine for testosterone)... but i dont need to study currently. thats why this is my current stack",2025-01-07 13:05:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1hvqzv5/my_routine_for_adhd_and_studying/

1l88fr2,Supplements,"Thinking of a simple supplement stack for brain fog & inflammation — CoQ10, B12, D, and Omega-3 — Thoughts?","Hey everyone, I’ve been struggling with brain fog (especially post-lunch) and inflammation, possibly related to diet and/or long-Covid. I want to keep my supplement routine simple and effective, especially since I do intermittent fasting (no breakfast, first meal at lunch).

Here’s the stack and schedule I’m planning to try:

**Morning (fasted):**

* Vitamin B12 — for energy and brain support, taken with water (won’t break fast)
* Optional: green tea or caffeine + L-theanine for focus

**Lunch (first meal, with fat):**

* CoQ10 
* Vitamin D3 + K2 
* Omega-3 

**Dinner (optional):**

* Optional second dose of omega-3 or magnesium before bed (not currently in the stack but considering for sleep)

# Why I chose these:

* B12 supports energy without breaking my fast
* CoQ10 helps mitochondrial energy and brain clarity
* Vitamin D3 + K2 for immune and brain health
* Omega-3 for inflammation and cognitive support

**Questions for you all:**

* Does this look like a good, balanced stack?
* Any potential interactions or timing issues?
* Should I add or remove anything?
* Anyone tried a similar setup with good results?

Thanks in advance! Would appreciate any input or tips.",2025-06-10 19:49:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1l88fr2/thinking_of_a_simple_supplement_stack_for_brain/
1kxy69b,Supplements,Really bad side effects from Yohimbine 2.5 MG from PrimaForce. Anyone else?,"So I’ve used Yohimbine in the past with very good success, I used to use it with a YCA stack. (Yohimbine, Caffeine, Aspirin). Always fasted always during cardio days, specifically HIIT days. So anyways I’ve gotten my heart rate all the way up to 180, during some of my HIIT sessions, so I’m no stranger to a high heart rate.          

I used to smoke marijuana, so my heart rate would be elevated all the time, but I guess when it is you just kind of get used to it. Nowadays, my heart rate has been very low, RHR is roughly like mid 60s, which is really weird because usually it’s like Right in the middle of 60 to 100.           

I’ve also been doing intermittent fasting lately, so today I broke my fast after I finish doing exercise alongside taking my supplements, 200 MG of caffeine, pill form, and 5 mg of Yohimbine HCI.         

Yesterday I took 2.5 MG of Yohimbine because I forgot that you’re supposed to take two. No problems yesterday, today literally right after working out I got home and my heart rate was still well over 120.           

Normally, it doesn’t stay that high, normally after exercise it drops down to like low hundreds, and then it goes down even further, but this time it didn’t.         

Started having really bad anxiety, and even as I type this, I’m still in 105 range, and I stopped working out almost two hours ago at this point.         

Now mind you, I did use the steam room after working out, so I would say in all honesty I left the gym completely about one hour and 15 minutes ago.           

I’ve been feeling dizzy and lightheaded, but I read that those are normal side effects from Yohimbine. I really don’t want to stop this supplement, even though I only use it on the weeks that I do HIIT, because one week I’ll do powerlifting one week I’ll do cardio.          

So it’s not like I use it every day all month long, I really only use it 10 days out of the month.           

But these are some pretty scary side effects. Anyone else have any issues using Yohimbine? Anyone have any documented cases or they actually had to go to the hospital because of some kind of heart issue?          

Further context beyond my explanation above, I’ve done a stress test, an echodiagram, too many ECG‘s to count, and I’ve had multiple blood drawings.       

The only more definitive test I would say in my opinion that I have not done yet is a CT coronary angiogram. But everything points to my health being optimal, lesser my cholesterol levels.         

And of course, my obesity, which to be honest is really weird that my levels would be good and not in the poor range, considering my obesity.        

Anyway, it’s just looking for some insight from fellow users of Yohimbine. Maybe I’ve become sensitive to it over the years. I haven’t used it heavily as much anymore.",2025-05-29 01:15:52,https://i.redd.it/oajbbe5rgm3f1.jpeg
1k8lhfd,Supplements,25M — LDL and blood sugar a bit high after becoming sedentary. Need advice!,"Hey everyone!
Just wanted to share my situation and get some advice.

I'm 25, 6'1"" (1.85 m), about 210 lbs (95 kg).
I used to be super active — gym, 10k+ steps a day, and I was even a soccer referee.
But... after tearing my ACL and getting stuck studying for my final university exams,
I basically turned into a couch potato for almost a year.

Lately, I’ve been feeling really tired and noticed a bit of a drop in libido, so I got some bloodwork done.


---

Here’s what came back (with the normal ranges):

Fasting glucose: 107 mg/dL (normal 70–99)

Total cholesterol: 214 mg/dL (normal <=190)

LDL: 161 mg/dL (normal <115)

HDL: 55 mg/dL (normal >=40)

Triglycerides: 98 mg/dL (normal <=150)

AST (GOT): 77 U/L (normal <50)

ALT (GPT): 55 U/L (normal <50)

Creatinine: 1.25 mg/dL (normal 0.72–1.18)

eGFR: 81 mL/min (normal >90 is perfect, 60–89 = mild reduction)

Vitamin D: 27.1 µg/L (ideal 30.1–100)

Iron: 63 µg/dL (normal 70–180)

Ferritin: 87.8 µg/L (normal 23.9–336.2)

Total Testosterone: 4.12 µg/L (normal 2.32–12.18)


> Small thing:
I worked out pretty hard the day before my blood test after months of being inactive,
so my AST, ALT, and creatinine might be a bit higher than usual because of muscle breakdown.




---

Game plan for the next 3 months:

Intermittent fasting (16/8)

Clean, slightly calorie-reduced diet (cutting sugars, bad fats, fried food, processed meats)

10,000 steps every day

Bodyweight training 3x a week

Supplements:

Vitamin D3

Omega-3s

Zinc

Magnesium

Psyllium fiber



Then after 3 months I’ll retest everything + add:

Free testosterone

SHBG

LH

FSH
to check the full hormonal picture.



---

Main thing I want to ask:

Does this overall plan sound good to you?

Any extra tips or things you would tweak?

Anyone been through something similar?


Also, thinking about adding:

Berberine (500 mg twice a day) for blood sugar

Red yeast rice (Monacolin K) for LDL


Should I start them now or wait to see what happens just with diet + exercise first?

I heard sometime taking certain too much of things can hinder ability to absorb other minerals too.

Also, i try to do intermittent fasting (16:8) daily so I’m afraid the smaller windows eating and the intervals between intakes could be bad and less effective on 2 per day supplements?

I’m taking
- Glucosamine 2. total of 2000mg/50mcg (first meal and last meal)
- Vitamin C 2. total of 1000mg (first meal and last meal)
- Multivitamins (too many to list but i guess you guys here have an idea, Japanese DHC brand)
- Fish oil 1-3 1000mg. depend if i workout that day
- L Carnitine Tartrate (1000mg) for Pre-Workout 
- Calcium (333.3mg), Magnesium(133.3mg), Zinc (8.3mg), Vitamin D (100 I.U.)
- Biotin 10,000mcg

- This is medicine but i take 1mg of Finasteride every other day

I take GABA capsules (mostly half of 750mg) on someday if im in bad mood or can’t sleep much.

1jj20rm,Supplements,Help to pick the right supplements,"Hi!

I find myself in a tuff place in life and really want to change things up. I dived deep into the supplements world until the point i got a bit overwhelmed by the options and was hoping some of you could give me some advices.

35M Diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety, Chronic Tension Headache with neck pain, Autoimmune disease Hidradenitis Suppurativa, Back Acne, Binocular Vision Dysfunction and Sinusitis (Still have congestion with mucus in nose and throat despite multiple surgeries in my sinuses.)

Discomfort in my gut (Specialist just told me to eat fiber supplement but it doesnt help). Dry eyes, Dry skin, Dry mouth, Sore and stiff joints and Feet pain. (Checked for Arthritis in my hands but no arthritis.) Often have cramps in my legs and feet and temperature regulation is terrible.

Prescribed Pregabalin 300x 2 daily for Chronic headache, Amitriptyline 50mg x1 at night for Chronic headache, Fluanxol (Flupentixol) 1mg x2 daily for Anxiety and to help control my thoughts, Elvanse 50mg daily for ADHD, Mometasone for chronic sinusitis. Also just been presciped long term antibiotics for my Hidradenitis Suppurativa as it keeps breaking out and i have had a lot of surgeries by now but i really dont want to start antibiotics if i can avoid so and i feel like a least trying with some anti inflamatory supplements would make sense to try aswell. Already had plenty of Antibiotics.

Before this i was on a terrible path with 20 painkillers a day were Tramadol were one of them for a long period so this is already an improvement. But man there's room for more. Besides the above symptons my mental health is terrible.

I always feel fatigued, generally have a bad mood, no motivation for anything, dulled emotions, evolved bad temper and easily gets annoyed. I don't really want to be around people, i have no mental clarity and never peace in mind. At the same time i feel kinda depressed i also feel super sensitive and easily gets very emotional and overwhelmed. Often get like stomach ache just thinking about life and i think a lot about death. Despite the medication i don't feel like my ADHD is better and sometimes im in doubt if its ADD and some days i even feel like it made it worse and that im bipolar or have autismn now. I still can't focus and i have 40 pages open with youtube videos because i cant finish them before seeing something else that will caught my eye and i still have restless legs despite my meds. I feel like the doctors don't understand me and im stuck on this medication path with lots of side effects and little outcome and also got a bad weed addiction. Its just bad.

I want to get better and make up for all theese antibiotics and painkillers+meds. I looked a lot on youtube and found quite a lot of stuff interesting. I know most of it probably wont do anything for me but i do want to give it a chance. But im kinda lost in all the options and how i should try to implement it and what to prioritise.

**Theese are supplements i have found that COULD potentially do SOMETHING for me and then i add'ed a few bulletpoints that made it interesting to me:**

A good Multivitamin - Currently leaning towards this one with Bioavailable forms. Any opinions?  [https://www.sunday.de/en/multivitamin-essentials-one-a-day.html](https://www.sunday.de/en/multivitamin-essentials-one-a-day.html)

I found this ""Nerve support"" supplement with both Benfotiamine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2 and Vitamin D. And then i found ""TurmericAstin"" Which is a combination of Turmeric and Astaxanthin. Is that a good option?

And then there's my gut discomfort that havent been resolved with fibers. I think its something with my liver or gallbladder or perhaps because of my bile. Its in that area i have discomfort and it makes sense to me if its my liver reacting on all the painkillers back then and now the meds+bad eating habbits and lifestyle? It did start back then and been going for at least 5 years. Maybe some of theese could help?

*Liver detox with: Folate, Choline, and proprietary blend from Milk thistsle seed extract, 0x bile extract, Turmeric root extract, SAMe, CoQ10, Black pepper, Astaxanthin*

Im getting my daily steps in and try getting more sunlight. Im starting fitness and i want to start eating Keto perhaps with intermittent fasting as i know theese changes could solve a lot by itself.

But man its a lot of big changes and not something that happens overnight so i really need all the help i can get. If just a few makes a difference its all worth it.

What would you prioritise and try first?

Anybody have a good Multivitamin to reccomend?

Have you been in a similar situation and how did you progress?

Any other  or better suggestions for me?

1ily10c,Supplements,Supplements and edema,"I went to a functional medicine doc that had me do a lot of bloodwork and testing to find out the best ways to optimize with supplements.

K force (D + K2)
Orthomega (Omega 3)
Orthobiotic (Prebiotic - Probiotic)
Mitocore (multi)
L-Glutathione 
Macro support (Pure Encapsulation)

Whenever I take more than a few supplements I seem to get edema, where my feet and ankles get a little bit swollen and retain fluid. Other than this I am healthy. I workout, cold plunge and sauna regularly.  I do intermittent fasting most days and extended fasting once a year. And I have no known health issues. But every time I start adding back supplements I get this edema back and then I stop taking my supplement and it goes away. Is this something that others see happen to them when they add to a supplement stack?  I’m just tying TJ figure out if that’s for sure where it is coming from so I can figure out what to keep taking and what to drop.

1h5uxjm,Supplements,"HMB, Cancer, and Neurodegenerative Diseases","I've been taking HMB for potential gainz. I've discovered some potential concerns about it's safety in certain populations.

First let's talk about what it is and proposed mechanisms.

HMB, or β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, is a naturally occurring leucine metabolite. It's used for increasing lean mass but has questionable efficacy. Consensus seems to be that it can be useful for preventing muscle loss (anti-catabolism) especially during a cut, but isn't that effective for increasing muscle gains in otherwise optimal conditions.

It's most widely thought to work by activating mTOR signalling, which tells cells (including muscle) to grow.

[But this study suggests](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo04174c/unauth) it actually increases phosphatidic acid, which activates phosolipase D2 (PLD2) and affects some of the same downstream targets of mTOR, namely P70S6K and S6. These alter protein synthesis and help prevent muscle from breaking down.

That all sounds great, but here's the kicker: **Excessive PLD2 activation may increase the risk of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases**.

For cancer, this is because it helps tumors grow more.

It could increase the chances of neurodegenerative diseases because it may increase the potential for amyloid and alpha-synuclein production while also inhibiting their breakdown.

TLDR: HMB could cause things to grow, including tumor cells and pathogenic proteins. It's otherwise safe, but exercise caution if you have a history of cancer or family history of neurodegenerative diseases.

I'm going to continue taking it on training days, but I'd like to implement some autophagy-inducing practices like intermittent fasting occasionally to keep things in balance.

HMB still seems very safe and mild, you just have to think about the tradeoffs you get when you tell cells to grow more. The same downsides probably come with anything that is truly anabolic, like more serious performance enhancers.",2024-12-03 18:55:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1h5uxjm/hmb_cancer_and_neurodegenerative_diseases/
1h51ptp,Supplements,Any new non-stimulant appetite suppressants? ,"Abnormally high appetite despite no deficiencies. Regular exercise, 10k steps per day,  high protein and fiber diet, and Decent sleep (which only gets disturbed because I wake up hungry once or twice per week).

1gnbra3,Supplements,Frustrated blood work numbers haven’t moved much despite sooo much effort ,"I had my annual physical in April of 2024 - at that time, the results of my blood work (lipids panel primarily) scared the daylights outta me. I changed a lot about my lifestyle since then. I’ve increased exercise, eliminated most if not all processed foods and sugar, I’ve added intermittent fasting, and I’ve lost about 18-20 pounds since then. For context I am 58F 5’-4” and now about 140 lbs, was 160 lbs at the time of physical. 

I started taking supplements daily after the physical: omega 3, 6 and 7, coQ10, curcurmin, magnesium, berberine, b-complex, DHEA, NAD plus my thyroid meds (I have Hashimoto).

I guess I thought my cholesterol would go down faster given the huge change in lifestyle plus the supplementation and my triglyceride number surprises me and I wonder if it’s because once I started intermittent fasting I upped my fat intake… Healthy fats that is. I find it helps me from over eating . Anyway, sharing the numbers below and I was curious if anyone has had a similar tract. And/or ideas of what more I can do??? I wonder if some of the loss of forward progress between July and November is because it’s getting cold out and my walks have been shorter… I don’t know… Just frustrating to be trying so hard and to see such slow results.

1gj0wyt,Supplements,"besides good ole' coffee/caffeine, what are some supplements that can aid in dropping pesky water weight?","Title.

So for whatever reason, my body seems to LOVE storing water weight (🤦‍♂️). Not uncommon for my weight to fluctuate 5-8 pounds just from water weight alone

Thanksgiving holiday is probably the most extreme example. Typically I'll weigh myself the day before to get a baseline and I'll show like 191 lbs (for example) on the scale, then the day after Thanksgiving I'll weigh myself again and notice I'm ""suddenly"" 197-198 lbs 😂

For context, I'm 6'4"" and the way I notice the water weight is my belly area puffs up (as in, I can visually see a large bulging) and looks like a pregnant woman depending on the time of week. Then, overnight, I notice my belly area flattens out... presumably because I dehydrate a bit while sleeping

So besides the obvious one of coffee/caffeine, what are some other supplements for clearing out this nuisance water weight?

As a side-note, I drink plenty of coffee as part of my intermittent fasting... yet ""despite"" this my body still likes piling on the water weight 🙄",2024-11-03 23:49:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1gj0wyt/besides_good_ole_coffeecaffeine_what_are_some/

In particular, I take Omega-3 and Magnesium Glycinate together with food whenever I eat my meal, but I also decided to take fiber to really make sure I don't have too much gut issues.

The problem with taking fiber and the other two together is that I'm worried that the fiber will just pull the nutrients I want to keep from being absorbed, which doesn't sound very optimal to me–

Is the Fiber overdoing it since I'm already using Mag Gly. and Probiotics (I take that on empty stomach) or is there another way I can go about this?

1e0s4dw,Supplements,"Supplements stack, MTHFR, Hashimoto, menopause","Hello… I am 58F, 5’4”, 146 pounds. I have recently lost a significant amount of weight… From 171 pounds to my current 146. I have been on a semiglutide medicine as well as supplementation and two meds for my thyroid, synthroid and Cytomel. 

I recently started intermittent fasting as I thought it might help with the stubborn belly fat I have. I saw fairly immediate results, but it has definitely altered my supplementation schedule and maybe that’s OK?

My questions are multifold, and I understand they are may not be one person who could answer all of them, but if you have any information that might be helpful for me related to any of the questions I pose, please weigh in… I would greatly appreciate it .

Here is my routine:
- Synthroid, somal, and methylated B vitamin upon waking up.
- I typically break my fast with a teaspoon of peanut butter (fresh ground) or some left over grilled chicken breast or a hard boiled egg.
- after I break my fast, I have my protein shake, which consists of five different powders… I take a protein powder called Ella for my hair skin and nails. I don’t think it works nearly as well as the other one I take which is called sparkle. Sparkle is hydrolyzed, and when I added that, I noticed my nails grew really fast and got so much stronger even though I had been taking the other one for months. I also take a greens powder, a probiotic powder and a polyphenol powder which is called Spectrum Vibrance 
- while I drink this mixed powder shake, I take the rest of my supplements with the exception of the Berberine
- I take the berberine after dinner, before bed.


My questions:
- I had seen somewhere that riboflavin was important to take so I added it and I’m not even sure why. Do you think this is useful?
- The spectrum vibrance is $50 per month and a significant portion of the overall supplementation budget. I am not eating a lot of fruit these days because I am trying to control my insulin spikes so it seems like it might be worth it to keep that on board?
- If I am to keep the polyphenol supplementation on board, is there a more bio available option for it versus the spectrum vibrance?
- I am taking the vitamin D3 twice per week… Do you think that is enough?
- I am taking the GLA (omega 6) every other day. It has 1.3 g of borage seed oil. Should I eliminate this entirely? Or take it every day?
- should I be taking selenium because of the Hashimoto’s?
- are there any on my stack that you believe I should not be taking or any suggestions of things that might be helpful given my age.
- are there any brands that you see that I am taking that would be less optimal than a different brand?

I have added exercise, mainly in the way of walking and strength training. I feel better than I have in a long time and I’m just not sure if it’s from the supple lament or from adding an exercise or from the Intermittent Fasting or from being on a semaglutide. The semiglutide is out of stock and I hope I don’t regain the weight. I feel like I’ve instituted a lot of healthy measures since being prescribed that… My BMI as well as hypertension is what qualified for it to be covered under insurance. If I were to try to get it today, I would not qualify. 

Thank you for any advice you can offer.

1cikbij,Supplements,Why am I not absorbing chromium and iodine from my multivitamin?,"Hi all. Last year I was diagnosed with a lot of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. I had issues with dry/brittle hair, skin and nails, teeth and gums, getting sick, sugar and junk food cravings, etc...  I corrected these by taking a multivitamin, D3/K2, and magnesium (switched between citrate and glycinate but I liked both). Thankfully all my vitamin and mineral levels went up and I feel much better. EXCEPT for iodine and chromium. My multivitamin has 150 mcg iodine (in potassium iodide form) and 35 mcg chromium (in chromium picolinate form). 

What seems to be causing this poor absorption? Both are provided in well-absorbed and bioavailable forms. So I don't understand. I did blood work and noticed that I have low iodine levels and high testosterone (I'm a woman) and have high normal glucose and insulin. I'm concerned I might have insulin resistance or even PCOS (though I've never been diagnosed before). I recently lost a lot of weight as well so it doesn't make much sense (I did so through intermittent fasting which is great for insulin sensitivity). However I'm highly convinced my low iodine and chromium levels are responsible for this.

Thanks for all your help. If it helps to mention, I have been tested for intestinal permeability and h pylori (decreases stomach acid which makes digesting/absorbing nutrients more difficult) and these may be likely responsible for any deficiencies I had last year.",2024-05-02 16:40:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1cikbij/why_am_i_not_absorbing_chromium_and_iodine_from/

For 3 weeks, I’ve noticed that my blood pressure and heart rate has been high. On Thursday, I had a doctor’s appointment and they ran some blood tests as well as did an EKG and ordered me to be fitted for a heart rate monitor to wear for 24 hours.

Cholesterol: 268

HDL: 50

Triglycerides: 172

LDL:186

My PCP doesn’t want to prescribe a statin for my cholesterol or anything for blood pressure since she says my cardiovascular risk is low. All she said was work on losing weight, exercise more, and stick to low a low carb and low fat diet. She wasn’t too concerned since my cardiovascular risk is low, but I still feel pretty worried. I have a referral to see a dietician as well as to see a sleep specialist regarding the sleep apnea. My EKG and all other blood tests came back normal. 

I plan on increasing my exercise to 30 mins 5x a week, sticking to a DASH diet and working on losing weight. For weight loss I plan on doing intermittent fasting and look into doing keto.

I did notice benefits from intermittent fasting so I don't want to stop that and I'm overall a sensitive sleeper so I don't really want to risk my sleep quality unless it's really the better option.

180qxwj,Supplements,Questions about anti-inflammatory supplements (+ guidance from a book),"First off, I've posted here before about my health issues. Mostly constantly fatigue, malaise, brain fog, anxiety, etc. **I have seen many doctors and have been tested thoroughly.** 


With that said, what's the consensus on antinflammatory supplements when it comes to volume? Like would you say one is good enough? Two? Five?


I currently take a good amount of supplements. And while they help a bit, I still feel like garbage and want to revamp my stack. I do eat quite decently, exercise, drink water, etc. Currently in the AM I take Glutathione and electrolyte powder (mainly for taste) on an empty stomach. I started adding L-Citrulline 2g to it the other day and am unsure if it helps or hinders. A bit later I take Nutrabio multi, fish oil 2g, Monolaurin (EBV), Vitamin D 2000IU, and Kelp 325mcg (low iodine). Later I take fish oil 2g and the other 2 multivitamin capsules. I intermittently take vitamin C as well.



I was reading the book *Get Serious* by Dr. Brett Osborn, a neurosurgeon. In it he does go over diet, fitness, and how fundamentally all disease is linked to inflammation and oxidative stress. He suggests a few supplements that I've heard different things about. First was fish oil, which I take anyway and I feel I need due to not eating fish at all. He then mentions Resverstrol (Reddit seems to be back and forth on this one), Curcumin, Vitamins A/C/D/E, Vitamin B Complex, Probiotics, and Green Tea Extract. I may be missing some. But the Resveratrol and Curcumin stuck out to me. I feel like if I added those it'd be... a lot. Maybe I should ditch my current stack and adopt his?


Last time I tried Curcumin I felt it made me a little angsty. I just need to at least move in the right direction.

17fl8an,Supplements,my routine for ADHD," So i wrote the following text months ago, but it wasn't published on the relevant subreddit about ADHD because iM nOt aLLowEd tO aDverTIse SupPleMEnts tHAt aRe NOt pRovEN tO hELp.   
If u r interested:

TL;DR: my daily routine:   
wakeup > easy workout with hometrainer > contrast showering > around 11am supplements (L Tyrosine, and others. see below) and first meal > (university, weight training, 2nd meal at 19 o'clock) > supplement (L Tryptophan) > good sleep

**main:**

* **1) workout:**  
**a)** i am starting the day with an **easy workout (max 30 minutes)** at home with my hometrainer (stepper/bike). When i was in school, i was always driving from home to school with a bike. School was much easier after this, i was so much more relaxed (before i did this, it usually felt like that i was FORCED to sit quietly on a chair. But i couldnt) and my focus was great. (or you can go for a walk instead)  
**b)** after my morning workout i do **contrast shower**: 30 seconds warm then 30 seconds cold for 3 times and ending the shower with warm/hot water. I used to 'only cold' shower but contrast shower is way more relaxing.  
**c)** others: i do weight training later. Its not that important, but still relaxing and improves my sleep quality a little.
* **2) diet:**  
**a)** normally i would be extremly tired after the first meal, but since i started **Low Carb/Keto** i have much more energy and dont want to sleep immediately after eating. Its great! If u low carb, its important to consume good fats - some studies have shown that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, especially EPA and DHA, can reduce symptoms of ADHD.  
**b)** no coffee: **gut health** is so important for ppl with ADHD, and i noticed that drinking coffee makes me extremly depressed, anxious and is so bad for my gut health since it acidifies my gut. Maybe it works for u but the key point here is: **Listen to your gut!**  
**c) alcohol & sugar is bad**: Its commonly known that ppl with ADHD have a lower dopamine level and they tend to eat too much sugar because of it since it increases your dopamine levels. But surprise, its bad for your body and health lol. If u r doing low carb, u r not allowed to consume too much sugar anyways. **Supplements can help** here! \[**see 3) supplements a)** L-Tyrosine/ L-Phenylalanine\].  
**d**) others: I do intermittent fasting (16/8), i start my meals with vegetables (+ added oil) and then i eat eggs, meat or anything else. and i wait atleast 30 minutes before i drink after the meal for better digestion.
* **3) supplements:**  
Have your blood tested (!) and talk to your doc before u take anything - especially if u r already on meds!  
**a) L-Tyrosine/ L-Phenylalanine** (for dopamine): Since L-Tyrosine is synthesized from L-Phenylalanine, u can buy **one** of those and it helps to improve your dopamine levels (+ your focus and attention). Like i already mentioned, people who have ADHD have lower dopamine levels, and Tyrosine/Phenyl. helps! It even helped me to consume less sugar.  
(*site note*: *Some people may respond better to L-tyrosine, while others may respond better to L-phenylalanine)*  
**b) L- Tryptophan/ 5-HTP** (for serotonin): Tryptophan converts in the body to 5-HTP, which is why u only need **one** of both. I take it to have a balance between dopamine and serotonin, and especially because it improves my sleep quality a lot! (i cant wake up with my alarm clock if i dont take L Tryptophan. yikes)  
**c) vitamine B complex, vitamine D:** some studies have shown that ppl with ADHD have a lower level of vitamine B and D. I am taking it but dont have any significant improvements - but they are essential for your body anyways. Healthy diet should be enough.  
**d)** others: usually **Ginkgo Biloba** helps ppl with ADHD, it did not help me. I take **ashwagandha** and it is relaxing and helping me! I took **L'Theanine** after Huberman suggested it for better sleep (no significant improvement. L Trypto works better for me). Sometimes i supplement with coffein, instead of drinking coffee. 
* **4) daily help, things that will/can help, things i personally want to implement, etc:**  
**a)** u know this feeling that u have 10 things in mind u need to do and u cant focus on your work because its in your head the whole time. Writing it down (big) on paper or on a **whiteboard** helps a lot to eliminate those thoughts.  
**b)** meditation: studies have shown that meditation has a huge impact on ADHD. I am not meditating yet, but i really want to start! '**mindfulness meditation**' is highly recommended for ppl with ADHD!  
**c)** to keep my focus while studying, i take a break after 1 to 1.5 hours AND do NSDR (non- sleep deep rest) (see youtube). It is similar to mindfulness meditation, and its great. Try it!  
**d)** be creative and make boring/necessary things interesting for YOU. For example: I personally dont like going for a walk or hiking - it is just too boring. I started to hunt eatable mushrooms. It is a great, relaxing hobby of mine - and i save money. For me it is like Pokemon Go, u really dont know what u find lol.  
**e)** interesting too: glutamate diet (""some studies have reported that there are lower levels of glutamate in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with ADHD""),...

In the end, listen to your body what works the best for you. Ppl use to think that ADHD is a desease but for me personally it is only a desease if i dont know how to fix or how to handle it. Most of us are more creative than ""normal"" ppl. Maybe it is even a strength.  
**If u have more/other interesting points u think are important, then pls share them with me!**  
(I am not a native speaker, so forgive my grammar mistake. But, u can correct me if i did content errors.).",2023-10-24 19:35:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/17fl8an/my_routine_for_adhd/
17fgqk0,Supplements,Does anything ACTUALLY help reducing hunger?,"I'm not looking for something to do the work for me.

NOR am I looking for a ""fat burner"" because I know those are a scam.

But has anyone had any good luck with any supplement that just helps calm hunger and cravings down a bit so that it's easier to count/cut calories and even practice intermittent fasting?

Back in 2016 I lost 48 lbs. for my wedding and was taking a product called ""Brighter Day"" but unfortunately I believe it's discontinued now. 

Anyone on this Subreddit have any good suggestions for something that might actually help with hunger and cravings a bit? 

I lost 106 lbs. last year doing keto and fasting (**324 down to 218**).

This year I've been doing a ton of weight lifting, and my weight is floating around 235.

I still would like to get my weight down to around 190 as my ultimate goal.

I think all the weight lifting has made fasting harder because I'm hungrier.

17e11cf,Supplements,"Supplement review for schizophrenia, calm, testosterone boosting, emf reilef,","I'm hoping some experienced supplement-buffs can critique the extensive supplement list I'm taking; alert me to possible interactions, maybe suggest some supplements to add or remove.

&#x200B;

Schizophrenia is very debilitating illness even with the best medications and therapy. I've done some research on what will work best for natural treatment and have read a number of articles. I've also discussed most of these supplements with my psychiatrist, minus the ones I've not added yet. He approves and even seems somewhat impressed on what I've come up with. I'm adding several soon for the sake of EMF relief as I've dealt with a bit of wifi sensitivity from before I got schizophrenia and I can't imagine it being good for it.

&#x200B;

I think this might be politically controversial and I really hope this doesn't turn into a political discussion, but I'm also trying some basic testosterone boosting as modern testosterone levels are  known to be the lowest in history and testosterone is very important physiologically.

&#x200B;

This has been very expensive, especially for someone on Disability. I'd estimate at least $300 per month, though it was more expensive when I was first getting started. However, since I've started supplementation with these things, symptoms have improved dramatically. Though I still struggle frequently with things like racing thoughts, I'm hoping the addition of magnesium citrate will help.

&#x200B;

In general, despite being at least 75 pounds overweight, I'm in good health. I eat somewhat healthy generally, have good blood level numbers, practice intermittent fasting and am somewhat physically active as I get a lot of walking in.

&#x200B;

Here is the list, I'm trying to make it as organized as possible without any superfluous information:

&#x200B;

Supplements are taken for schizophrenia/anxiety unless otherwise noted.When doses are specified, it means I'm megadosing

• = indefinitely discontinued for specified reason

$ = expensive per dose

&#x200B;

1. inositol 6g
2. $ berberine (general health)
3. resveratrol\* (too many brain antioxidants and general antioxidants)
4. N Acetyl Cystine
5. glutathione 2g
6. methylene blue
7. $ acetyl l carnitine
8. ACES (vitamins A,C,E and selenium)
9. $ Dr Berg Electrolyte blend (about 25% DV potassium and magnesium) (general health)
10. Iodine (including algin) (emf relief)
11. rhodiola rosea
12. glycine 3g
13. $ nicatinomide riboside (aka NR)
14. $ NMN\* (replaced with NR)
15. tumeric curcumin\* (to be replaced with tumeric cooking spice in drink mix for cost effectiveness)
16. taurine 4g
17. vitamin b12, b6, b1, b2, methylfolate, d3, k2
18. sarcosine
19. fish oil
20. ashwagandha
21. l-theanine
22. aspirin\* (on too many supplements that could cause blood thinning and planning to add more bloodthinning supplements like spirulina)
23. ginkgo biloba
24. melatonin
25. yeast based probiotics (monitor for effects on Seborrheic dermatitis (common with schizophrenia))
26. saw palmetto\* (replace with testosterone bosting complex including saw palmetto)

TO ADD SOON:

1. spirulina (emf relief, general health and nutrition)
2. turkey tail powder (mushroom) (emf reilef, general health and nutrition)
3. reishi powder (mushroom) (emf relief, general health and nutrition)
4. lion main powder (mushroom) (focus, general health and nutrition)
5. cinnamon (spice for drink mix) (anti-inflammatory)
6. tumeric (spice for drink mix) (anti inflammatory)
7. $ superfoods greens and fruits powder mix (general health)
8. magnesium
9. Alpha-Lipoic Acid
10. coenzyme q10$ calcium

using red light therapy, considering adding blue soon.

&#x200B;

notes:- i've noticed significant skin-brightening with addition of antioxidants ACES, glutathione, NAC, resveratrol, methylene blue. This is attractive but alarming and concerning. I know at a certain point, antioxidants start reversing their anticarcinogenic properties and begin to become carcinogenic. I'm wondering if skin brightening is a sign of that.

16zamg2,Supplements,NAC was amazing for 4 days... then it wore off. Same with broccoli sprouts. How do I get the benefits back?,"
Tried NAC after having amazing benefits from broccoli sprouts (which wore off), had amazing benefits like energy, increased sociability, almost euphoria-like mood, and then the benefits wore off.

I initially was taking 1200 a day, then upped it to 2400, then almost 3000. Now I feel like I did before.

What’s causing it to wear off? If these compounds help diminish oxidative stress on the brain and hence provide these benefits, then why does the brain tend to go back if you keep trying to diminish the oxidative stress?

Should I add glycine? Or maybe a smaller dose is necessary, like as if there’s a sweet spot to the dosing?

I normally feel like a zombie with brain fog too debilitating to enjoy socializing or appreciate life. I’m already on a keto diet eating only organic with intermittent fasting and doing plenty of exercise. I also take creatine, magnesium, and vitamin D.

I also doubt it’s placebo as I’ve tried dozens of supplements and nothing ever worked, no matter how hopeful or convinced I was that they would.

1666g8l,Supplements,Best supplement for insulin resistance?,"Please read the whole post.

I am a 21yo 5’10 79.6kg male. For a long while Ive been struggling to lose weight. When I was in my teens I was around 90kg but I lost weight by eating less and I didnt even exercise.

I lost 20kg so I KNOW how fat loss works.

Fast forward to a few years ago, diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Today I am treated with Levothyroxine and Cytomel (T4+T3).

In the past few years Ive been around 85kg. Fucking stuck.

Ive tried 2100cal-1800-1500-1200 and I cant lose weight. I PROMISE YOU that I weigh every single gram of food I have.

ON TOP of that, I have trained 3-4x a week of strength training.

Now I gotta say in the past few years where I did do strength training, I was extremely sedentary besides gym. Like NO cardio at all.

In the recent month Ive started eating at 1500 and first weighing at 81kg. But this time Ive added 150min a week of moderate intensity stationary bicycling on top of strength training.

AND I used Berberine. Currently I weigh 79.6kg and here is my myfitnesspal weight [tracking](https://imgur.com/a/Bx5JTLb)

As you can see, I am losing weight that is true. But to eat 1500cal at this age and weight/height and lose weight so slow is odd.

I weigh myself same exact time of day btw, after a toilet break.


In the end of that picture you can see it slowing down but one thing that I changed during that period (where my weight loss went slower) was that I stopped taking Berberine because it ran out. 

Now Im making this post to ask for anything as helpful or more helpful than Berberine because I think I have insulin sensitivity 

I pee alot, and I wake up constantly during the night just to pee a small bit (but my bladder feels full)

I have very blurred vision and its not due to myopia since the blurryness comes and goes plus my eyes are 20/20 when I recently did a check.

I have increased hunger but I can control it.

My neck and torso has some dark patches.

My waist is around 40inch (100cm). Im like an hourglass, my lovehandles has most fat

Would love to take some blood tests but my doc denies me. And I cant really change docs since my doc is considered the best in my area. Im grateful for my doc because noone else wouldve given Cytomel but I guess they cant help with everything.

And I dont have enough money to go to private .

Anyway, what Im trying to say is that I seem to have insulin sensitivity, Ive lost 20kg before so I know all about CICO and I also have tried intermittent fasting and keto.

Keto did help a bit but it is INSANELY hard to workout on it let alone have a diet on it.

Berberine has helped so Im looking for something similar or stronger, hopefully stronger.

Ive read about Inositiol but is it really as good as Berberine?",2023-08-31 09:38:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1666g8l/best_supplement_for_insulin_resistance/

I got some Magnesium glycinate just last week and while it has been fantastic for my recovery, I have no more soreness after lifting weights, it also keeps me from sleeping!

I take 3 tablets, one at breakfast, one at lunch and one at dinner around 4 pm(I do intermittent fasting and eat early) or after my evening walk, an hour before bed around 8 pm.

Starting today I'm going to drop the last one and only have 2x125mg per day hoping this will solve the issue.

Has anyone experienced it as well?  
I dont want ot completely stop as the benefits are getting are huge.

- Does taking caps will break the fast ? (I guess it depend of the caps but here it would be Ecklonia Cava, tocotrienols, sulforaphane, resveratrol and may be more)

1qzab4,Health,Can someone bring some clarity to meal timing for me?,"I thought about posting this question in /r/nutrition, but I didn't want a pseudo science, fad diet type answer to this question. I am speaking strictly in terms of health here. I don't want to know the best meal timing for weight loss, muscle building, pre/post workout, blah blah blah. I have read that kind of crap 100 times over and the only conclusion I can draw, is that no one has a good answer.

I know the benefits of frequent meals, intermittent fasting, and anything type of meal timing strategy. My question is though, if there are studies showing the health benefits of intermittent fasting, 3 square meals a day, 6 meals a day, etc., how is can any of these be better than the other?

In terms of health and not weight loss, it seems like meal timing really doesn't matter because you can read about the positive health benefits of any one of these strategies. 

The reason I ask this question is because a few years ago, I was on a strict diet, eating 6 meals a day. It worked well. Then I went on a intermittent fasting diet where I only ate 1-2 meals per days and that also worked well. Now that I have stopped dieting, I find that I feel best when I listen to my body. I let my body tell me when I am hungry and that is when I eat. Sometimes it's 4 meals a day, sometimes it's only 1 or 2. I eat the amount I want until I am satisfied and I eat healthy foods as often as I can, which is mostly every meal.

I feel great and I look great, but there's always this lingering thought in my head that I am doing something wrong. I have been filled with fad diet nutritional advice since I started my 20's and I am having a hard time shaking it. Sometimes I eat more frequently just because I fall back into that mindset and think I should, not because I am hungry.

Can anyone relate and/or offer some insight? I just want to know if, in terms of health only, it's not bad for me to have a rather inconsistent eating schedule. I mean, isn't this how we evolved to survive after all? Eating when we were hungry and food was available?

xag43,Health,"Recurring upper abdominal pains for past months (likely gastritis). redditors of r/Health, I beg of your assistance.","
I've been unable to eat without fear of pain for 2 months now, and I still haven't been able to pinpoint what's wrong with me.

This all started a few months back, I'd say around March or April. At the time I was on a workout plan that incorporated a diet plan known as intermittent fasting, where I would go without food for 16 hours, break the fast with a small preworkout meal of less than say 500 calories, and then have a huge post workout meal of 1000+ calories. The first time I experienced these abdominal pains was after one of these huge meals. It was such a dull pain that I actually thought it had something to do with my chest muscles from the workout, and didn't think too much of it. The pains would go on and off, and as time went on they started to last longer each time they would hit. I then came to the realization that there was something seriously wrong when the pains started to last for a day and a half, and could no longer be ignored. After some research online and consulting a doctor, I confirmed that I had gastritis, though the cause I have yet to pinpoint. I suspect it might've been the intermittent fasting, though I can't say for sure (hopefully someone can shed some light on this perspective).

My doctor then placed me on medication for 5 days, for pain relief and gas relief, and told me to avoid foods spicy or oily and carbonated drinks. After the medication and a milder diet, the pain halted. Around 3 weeks later, I felt a small amount of pain one morning, which gradually got worse, arguably worse than it was before. I went back to the doctor, who prescribed me the same medicine and said to see what happens. I found that this time the medication did very little to relieve the pain, so I went back a few days later with the intention of being tested for a bacterial infection (H. Pylori I believe), but due to some complications I couldn't have the test administered that day. Instead I was prescribed 3 days worth of stronger medicine, and told to come back again if the situation didn't get better. The new medicine worked wonders, and for the 3 days and nearly a whole month that followed I didn't feel any pain. As soon as I was off the medication, I started experiencing diarrhea, though there was no pain otherwise. I still kept to a milder diet during that time, cutting down on oily/spicy food and carbonated drinks. However as of 2 days ago, I started to feel the smallest tingle of the pain again. It was so minor that I wasn't sure what to think of it, but throughout the entire day yesterday it persisted, gradually intensifying. When I woke up this morning, the pain was clearly noticeable, though not quite as strong as it was last time. A final note about the pain is that in some instances it shoots up to my neck as a sharp pain. I have no back pains however.

**TL;DR**
-Persistent stomach pains for past 3 or 4 months
-First occurrence after eating a large meal a few weeks into intermittent fasting
-Took medication, pain halted for about 3 weeks then came back even stronger
-Took stronger medication, pain halted for nearly a month and is currently slowly returning (much weaker than before as of now, but no telling if it will get worse)
-After the stronger medication, I've been experiencing diarrhea.
-Haven't been tested for H Pylori yet, though planning to next week.


And the questions I have:
-Was this brought on by intermittent fasting?
-Do I actually have gastritis, or is this something else?
-If it is simply gastritis, what are the chances that the recurring nature of the pains is caused by an H. Pylori infection?
-Finally, WHAT THE **FUCK** DO I DO.

Truth be told, I'm starting to get seriously stressed by this problem, and I only have a month left to deal with it here where there's actually health care before I go back to college in the States. I'd hate to have to pay the ridiculous medical bills there, nor would I know any good doctors. Above all that, I don't want to have to spend anymore time being unable to eat without fearing pain and other potential problems.

Apologies for an absurdly long post, but please, **HELP ME OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.**",2012-07-28 06:54:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/xag43/recurring_upper_abdominal_pains_for_past_months/

1im313s,healthyeating,Ideas for quick no-cook light breakfasts/snacks.,"I've been doing intermittent fasting over 2 years and normally don't eat my first meal until the evening, due to medicines I need to take later in the day. Lately I get gaggy or nauseous on an empty stomach earlier in the day and it's affecting my work, so I've decided to start eating a small, quick breakfast or snack in the morning on days I work. Some ideas I am excited about are overnight oats, made with unsweetened almond milk and berries, maybe pumpkin seeds. I've never done overnight oats before and love that I can just pop a few mason jars in the fridge the night before my first work day. I'm also thinking whole milk plain Greek yogurt with berries, and I found nice whole grain crackers I want to try with a bit of no salt no sugar almond butter, maybe also with pumpkin seeds. I like to eat a diet low in refined carbs, I generally avoid added sugar, high fiber, no red meat. I eat quite a bit of heart-healthy fat as I have high cholesterol but find eating pretty high fat helps me be less hungry, and I'd like to have a good amount of fat in my breakfasts as it helps settle my stomach. I'm excited to explore new healthy options and if anyone has ideas let me know!",2025-02-10 10:24:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1im313s/ideas_for_quick_nocook_light_breakfastssnacks/

11iljza,healthyeating,Healthy Eating Protocol," 

* **I'm not a doctor, this list is purely educational and my own opinion, always consult medical professionals before trying the below eating lifestyle.**
* **Grocery List! (What and What Not to Buy!)**  

   * Note, Certified Organic food (look for the organic label) is always better in both taste and quality, but do the best you can with your budget and available stores
   * **Meat**  

      * **Approved**: (Note, the below meats are to be bought in their natural state, AKA a portion of uncooked meat that needs to be refrigerated or frozen, so that you know you are getting just meat when you eat.)
      * Chicken
      * Beef/Steak
      * Eggs
      * Fish
      * Turkey
      * Shrimp
      * Pork
      * Anything else that used to be a living animal
      * **Disapproved**
      * Deli meats, like sliced ham, sliced turkey, AKA the sandwich meats you put on your sandwich as a kid
      * Bacon, Bologna, Ham, pepperoni - These contain Pork (which is fine), but then add a bunch of other random fake food stuff or refined sugar and other chemicals.
      * Any meat that has some kind of chemical formula added on the ingredients, AKA polysorbate or something to “preserve freshness”. The ingredients should just be meat (and possibly salt if there is a second ingredient)
   * **Fats**  

      * **Approved**
      * Walnuts, Almonds, pecans, any kind of seed or nut (including cashew or peanut) - just read the ingredients to ensure that the only thing added to the nuts is salt, if anything.
      * Avocados
      * Olives
      * Olive Oil, Avocado oil, Macadamia Oil (attempt to get all of these in a glass container, or else the oil will spoil and get rancid)
      * Butter (only thing added is salt)
      * Cheese - read the label and ensure it is just milk, salt, and enzymes, and no random other stuff added like carrageenan.
      * **Disapproved**
      * Peanut, vegetable, canola oil. Essentially if it isn’t the above good oils, don’t get it.
      * Again, read all ingredients of all packages, since the above bad oils sneak into many products, especially nuts.
      * Nearly every dressing on earth has some of the above bad oils in it, read the label before you buy.
      * Margarine - this is basically made up of the above bad oils
   * **Vegetables and fruits**  

      * **Approved**
      * Could you go to a farm and find it in the state you are buying it? If so, then it is good. Prechopped veggies/fruits are fine as well.
      * Some easy ones for my wife and I are spinach, cucumber, celery, cherry tomatoes, onions, sweet potatoes, normal potatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, squash, cauliflower, broccoli.
      * For fruits, apples, oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, blueberries, bananas are all good.
      * Frozen Veggies are OK, if you read the ingredients and ensure that there are NO foreign chemicals added to preserve food.
      * **Disapproved**
      * Canned Veggies, veggies with random chemicals added.
      * Canned Fruits, dehydrated fruits (these should only be used as a “treat” since they are super sugary but without as many nutrients),
   * **Drinks**  

      * **Approved**
      * Water. Get a water filter for your tap or get a water filter jug. You’ll notice the difference in water taste. Purchase spring water from the store if you want bottled water, not purified water. Reverse Osmosis water is the best from what I've researched, consider it an investment into your health, and always drink from glass bottles, not plastic or metal, due to how metal and plastic ""leeches"" chemicals into the water.
      * Milk - Research for yourself (maybe on DuckDuckGo or something not as heavily censored as Google) the risks and rewards of raw, unpasteurized milk
      * Coffee - No added sugar allowed, only milk or cream (again, the cream must be milk based and not made up of hydrogenated oils). Use sparingly.
      * **Disapproved**
      * Soda, fruit juices (orange/apple) this will cause you to drink excess calories and sugar.
      * No diet sodas either, these have artificial sweeteners which are NOT food and cause harm to your body.
      * Alcohol - From a health perspective, alcohol is not needed (if you are tanking up on veggies and fruits), and it often has a ton of added sugar and random other stuff, and it actually negatively affects your sleep quality when taken too close to bedtime, even if it initially makes you feel relaxed. Use at your discretion.
   * **Complex Carbs**  

      * **Approved**
      * Any Kind of potato, rice (read packages if you are going to get the microwavable kinds), oatmeal, quinoa, other grains, and beans. The beans can be canned, just ensure that there is no added sugar or random chemicals to them, AKA baked beans or refried beans.
      * Sometimes bread, again read the label and see what is added to the bread. If it sweetened by honey or stevia, then its fine, but generally most bread has a lot of chemical additives and refined sugar added. Use sparingly.
      * **Disapproved**
      * White bread (including tortillas), most types of bread (due to above reasons), pasta (same reasons as bread).
   * **Sweeteners**  

      * **Approved**
      * Honey, Stevia, agave, fruit based sweeteners
      * **Disapproved**
      * Refined sugar (brown or white), Splenda, any “no calorie” sweetener like aspartame or sucralose or other “diet” sweeteners found in sodas.
      * Sugar is added to nearly EVERY packaged good and frozen good (from pizza to bread to ice cream), so read the labels of what you buy if you want to buy something prepackaged instead of the raw ingredients above.
   * **Seasonings**  

      * Salt (it can be iodized), but I prefer the grinder salt.
      * As for other seasonings, just ensure it doesn’t have “spices” in the ingredients since that is probably MSG. Pretty much any spices are fair game then, read the label and ensure it doesn’t have any man-made chemical in the name (polysorbate, glutamate, etc.), and you should be fine.
* **Healthy Eating Lifestyle Tips and Tricks**  

   * Eat meat with each meal, and throw in a veggie or a fruit as well. Meat increases feelings of fullness, as well as builds/preserves muscle mass. Try a fist full of meat and however many veggies or fruits you can fit on your plate. Veggies and fruits are God’s vitamins!
   * Meal prep lots of cooked meat, so you don't have to constantly be cooking throughout the week, I use Blue Diamond pans from Walmart to cook up large amounts of chicken thighs, ground beef, or fish, for the week.
   * Fruit is often demonized since it contains sugar, however, it is quickly absorbed into the body and doesn’t contribute to weight gain as much as complex carbs, see below for explanation.
   * Calories are either going to come from complex carbs (rice/potatoes/oatmeal/bread) or from fats (like nuts or seeds or avocado).
   * Fats are a good source of calorie, since they don’t spike blood sugar and therefore won’t lead to you holding onto excess body fat as easily. Try to eat fats at each meal or as a snack until you feel full. Try half a handful of seeds or nuts at first, to see how full you feel after.
   * Complex carbs are best saved either before exercise, or at the last meal of the day. Complex carbs raise blood sugar and serotonin levels (which makes you feel happy and relaxed), both of which are good to have before exercise, or to have before bed, so that you go to bed with a happy mind. Excess carbs throughout the day will lead to the body to only burn carbs as fuel, and excess bodyweight will start to occur, since the body won’t burn fat as fuel if it has carbs as an available source. Experiment with how **little** complex carbs you can eat before exercise or at the end of the day, to get the desired effect of a good workout or a happy sleep. More strenuous exercise is going to need more complex and simple carbs (oatmeal and honey, white rice and grapes, etc.) in order for your body to be primed to perform.
   * Try to eat mostly 3 – 4 meals a day, as opposed to constantly grazing. The body won’t burn bodyfat if it is constantly having a full or half full stomach, since the blood sugar is continually spiking. This is why intermittent fasting is so effective, or why your stomach sometimes growls when you wake up as well as you look leaner, since your body is ready for food and is burning fat. Space out your meals, and try to combine snacks into the next meal, to give your stomach time to empty and your blood sugar to stabilize.
   * Constantly drink water throughout day, add a pinch of salt here and there to ensure your body is actually absorbing water as opposed to it just flowing through you. You could attempt to drink ½ your bodyweight in ounces of water (i.e. a 200 lb man will drink 100 oz of water), but I find it more effective to just get a glass water bottle and drink from it every hour or so. Experiment and find an easy water-drinking-routine for yourself.
   * **If you're trying to lose weight:**  

      * Sleep is king in all things health, especially with losing weight, see my post on sleep here: [How to Get Good Sleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/11ijzho/my_sleep_protocol_wish_i_knew_how_to_sleep_earlier/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
      * Commit to a pain-free, sustainable, exercise routine, I recommend this: [https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/). Try it for at least a month.
      * Focus on eating quality, organic delicious meals that you'll actually eat, from the above list. Search for FB groups of healthy recipes. Throw out any disapproved foods from the house, to make it harder to cheat.
      * Start out with baby steps, like drinking water instead of soda, and cooking at home more.
      * Really challenge yourself to get most of your calories from fat, if not entirely for a few weeks. You will drop pounds quickly with this method, but will eventually get carb cravings. Add in carbs as prescribed above (before training, at dinner), in moderation.
* **Sample Eating Day** \*\*\* I am extremely boring when it comes to what I eat, feel free to experiment and get creative with your healthy diet!\*\*\*  

   * **Breakfast**  

      * Drink 16 oz of water, add a dash of salt to it.
      * 1.5 fists of organic ground turkey, Pace salsa on top
      * 4 stick of organic celery
      * ½ handful of almonds
   * **Lunch**  

      * 1.5 fists of organic ground turkey, Pace salsa on top
      * 4 stick of organic celery
      * ½ handful of almonds
   * **Dinner**  

      * Whatever wifey makes me 😊
   * **Preworkout**  

      * 1 – 1.5 cups of oatmeal, drizzle honey on it (this is if training is going to be strenuous, like all out sprints or heavy lifting)
   * **Postworkout**  

      * Honey (otherwise I will feel dizzy or weak or foggy after training)
   * **Dessert**  

      * If I have a craving, it usually is satisfied with an apple and some walnuts.
* End Goal - To be happy, healthy, lean, strong, and be able to nurture and nourish and build up the amazing Body God has given us!

wvqmif,healthyeating,Trying to improve my diet as a picky eater,"Hey everyone. I'm 27m, 5'11"", and weigh roughly 300lbs after years of binge eating. About two weeks ago I started dieting to lose weight and improve my health in general. I'm doing 18/6 intermittent fasting with two meals a day and I try not to snack inbetween. I've been aiming for approximately 1300-1500 calories a day.

One of my biggest problems is that for my whole life my diet has been very limited, and it's not really healthy. I'm working on trying new foods, but I've not had very much success. Here's what my current diet looks like:

Lunch: I find it easier to simply have a selection of smaller snacks for lunch. I pretty much eat the same few things each day. These are:

- A couple of breadsticks with cream cheese

- Some rice crackers or seeded flatbread

- A salami stick

- Babybel mini cheese wheel

- A small bag of crisps (chips)

- A tangerine

This adds up to around 500-550 calories.

Dinner: For dinner I've been having either a pizza or just chicken and chips (fries).

Aside from the foods mentioned above, I'm also okay with yoghurts, raspberries, strawberries, most breakfast cereals. The only vegetable I've found that I'm okay with is spinach. 

Any ideas on what I could do?",2022-08-23 14:42:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/wvqmif/trying_to_improve_my_diet_as_a_picky_eater/

txpiw4,healthyeating,Can you eat too few calories?,"So I've been on a weight loss journey the past 16 months. I've lost over 100lbs so far, mostly with intermittent fasting, cardio (exercise bike),  and keto. I stalled out for the last 4 months though, hovering in the 320-330 range (originally 410). In the last few weeks I decided to try something different and I started just watching my calories, and while it worked great at first, I've found that eating until I'm hungry usually only gets me to about 1200 calories a day (mostly lean proteins and vegetables), and after factoring in my exercise, I get daily warnings from MyFitnessPal about not consuming enough calories. The last week I've actually started to gain weight back, just 2 lbs, but I'm wondering if I need to adjust my diet to increase my caloric intake, so that I'm hitting some baseline minimum. For reference, MFP tells me that I should be eating about 2500 calories a day, but I'm just not hungry for 2500 calories a day, and I'm trying not to get myself back into the unhealthy eating that led me down the bad roads to begin with.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just looking for some advice here. I'll find a way to healthily increase my calories if I need to, but I'm finally getting to a place where I don't turn to food for comfort or for stress reasons, so I'm trying to not just eat because this thing says I need to eat 2500 calories a day to healthily lose weight.",2022-04-06 16:01:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/txpiw4/can_you_eat_too_few_calories/
ssdu35,healthyeating,"What are some easy, no brain, and healthy meals that I could eat every single day?","I've tried different fad diets over the years such as keto or intermittent fasting. Never been good at keeping track like calories or what I eat. They usually work for a little bit, but then eventually Temptation goes over my head and I give in to cravings and binge. I want to get out of that cycle and I'm something sustainable that I can stick to.

One idea I have would be to eat the same thing every single day. So I would always keep the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This would make things super easy for me because I would know exactly what I am supposed to eat and when. I could make sure that I get all the necessary nutrients and stuff I need for the day in those meals.

I have a few problems with that though. First is that I work in a restaurant that has literally one healthy option that I am sick to death of. I do get free meals when I work, which is definitely a Temptation that I've been trying to overcome. I tried doing some meal prep to take food to work, but it just takes up too much time and energy. At my core, I am incredibly lazy. I would rather do the thing that takes the least amount of effort, and that usually involves eating free food at work or stopping at some fast food on my way home.

I'm always home in the morning to make breakfast, and that's probably what I enjoy cooking the most. I'm a big fan of avocado toast and eggs. The rest of the meals I'm not sure about. Ideally it would be something that I can meal prep to take with me to work. My goal is to eventually lose weight, so I have no idea what kind of diet I would need to have. I've been trying to eat more vegetables, but they just leave me hungrier than if I would have eaten nothing at all.",2022-02-14 15:54:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/ssdu35/what_are_some_easy_no_brain_and_healthy_meals/
sioop2,healthyeating,"What are some easy, healthy, and tasty veggies that I can start eating regularly?","I've been trying (and failing) to eat a healthier diet.  I've tried fad diets like keto and intermittent fasting with some success, as well as tried counting calories and tracking what I eat.  Those ways are just not sustainable.  I'm too lazy to really keep up on any of that, and I'd rather just go back to old habits which are easier.  Most of the time what I eat is what is convenient.  It's much easier to catch a bite of fast food on the way home, or to pop whatever frozen meal I have in the microwave at home.  I don't mind cooking, I just feel as if I have no time for it.

A new thing I wanted to try was to just monitor what I have on my plate.  Like you want half of the plate being vegetables, a quarter meat, and a quarter carbs.  That's easy enough to visualize for me without having to count anything.  My issue is I can't think of any large amount of vegetables that I would really like to eat.  When I think of ""eat your veggies,"" I think of just raw carrots and celery, which are disgusting.  The only way I could eat them is with a super helping of dip, which pretty much defeats the purpose of eating healthy.

If I am eating veggies, the only thing I really like is cooked broccoli.  I like salads, but not for every single meal.  I also love root veggies if they are roasted like potatoes, carrots, and parsnips, but I think those count more towards carbs than ""veggies.""

rb0d4i,healthyeating,Tips needed for lowering cholesterol through diet,"So...I've struggled with borderline high cholesterol for about 10 years. So, I had always tried to minimize my ""bad"" fat intake.

Recently, I discovered intermittent fasting. It's worked great at keeping me at my ideal weight. BUT...the fact that I could eat without worrying as much about weight gain allowed me to go a bit wild. For several months, I completely abandoned all efforts to limited fat. Well, not surprisingly, I went for a physical, and my borderline high cholesterol was now just high (LDL was 178).

The doc wants me to return to a low-fat diet again otherwise he has to put me on a statin (something I'd like to avoid).

All this said...how do I do this low-fat thing right? The idea of a low-fat diet seems to have fallen out of favor in recent years, but I don't know any other way to get my LDL down. The only approach I know is to look at labels, and avoid stuff with a lot of saturated fat. But, I'll be honest, I feel like I'm just making this up as I go along.

I starting doing an extreme low carb style of eating 10  years ago (Atkins) it worked for me to lose weight and I found my appetite was surpressed and it was easy for me to do intermittent fasting 16:8. Over the last 10 years I've formed a unhealthy relationship with food- carbs specifically. I've gone through various cycles of eating extreme low carb and losing weight only to gain it back and binge on lots of junk food once I get to my goal weight and start incorporating carbs again. I have recognized this pattern and want to stop but I don't know how? I have seen things like fruit and beans as 'bad' for so long I feel like it's either binging on any and everything or super restricted no carb high fat food. 

I need and want to change my relationship with food. I want to be a healthy weight and feel good, feeding my body what it needs. I'm about 40lbs over weight right now and the only way I've ever been successful losing weight is a keto style of eating but I don't want to be stuck in the cycle anymore. How do I lose weight in a healthy way and make a permeant lifestyle change? Did I break my body?

fx7xry,healthyeating,Am I doing low carb/ intermittent fasting correctly?,"Hi!!!

I am doing a low carb/ intermittent fasting diet. So far it's working great and I feel good about it! I was just wondering if I'm doing it right and how effective it will be.

I'm meal prepping everything and rarely eat anything I just made. On days I go to work, I eat a breakfast bowl with sausage, eggs, bacon, taco sauce, and salsa. I usually use that as a filling for low carb breakfast burritos and have 3 or 4 of them in the morning along with almond milk. At work I don't eat anything but I will drink water. After work I'll eat low carb soft tacos with organic beef and low carb or organic versions of everything else used. Or I'll have grilled chicken and broccoli. I'll also drink a low carb organic beer with lime sometimes! Basically I'm just finding very low carb versions of foods I like and replacing them with what I usually eat. I also started going for long walks with my roommate at least 4 times a week.

Is this a good way of doing a diet like this? I tried keto but it was very hard keeping up with it as I felt too restricted. This time I'm focusing on keeping daily carbs to less than 50 and I'm liking this much better.

Spouse was depressed at work after not receiving a promotion and I reluctantly agreed to relocate our family of 6 closer to her parents.

 On top of extremely hating where we live now, i ruined my back in the move and dropped exercise as well as keto. Icing on the cake was my wife’s medical license was delayed 5 months so she stayed in our previous state and extended her employment to continue our insurance.  This left me alone to set up kids in schools (kids all under 12 at this point). This also left me alone every night with no community. What was a casual drinking attitude became full blown binge drinking just to sleep and ignore my loneliness and back pain. 

Before i knew it i had lost all my progress, could barely walk and severely depressed. I have no clothes that fit and walk around in basically two pairs of baggy 3xl shirts and cargo shorts with a closet full of larges. My health and mental health turned non existent and ended up in an ambulance from the drinking.

1mpngs1,keto,Stabilizing? Plateauing? (*Trigger warning for disordered eating*),"Hello everyone! I'm a 39F who started keto 8 months ago. I'm 5'4"" and I've gone from 150 pounds to 125 pounds. (Yes, it's very slow to come off, but slow and steady works for me!)

My question is this: for the last ... \~6 weeks or so, I haven't lost weight. My weight has gone up and down within a pound. Is this the weight my body is happiest at and where I need to accept it? Or is there something else I can do to get the last stubborn pounds of belly fat? (I was hoping to lose just 5 more pounds).

Important info: I've struggled with disordered eating in the past, so I don't count calories, just net carbs (keeping it under 25) and eating until I'm satisfied. With that said, I know my total calories for the day is definitely low already (around 1400). I don't want to lower my calories any more since I worry I'd go back to a dark mental place. I dunno, do I need to \*add\* calories? (I've always heard CICO, but there has to be a point where you go into starvation mode, right? I don't feel hungry though! I just stop when I'm full.) I do intermittent fasting, and my eating window is from 11-6. I usually eat two meals (breakfast shake and meat and veggie for dinner) with a snack in between.

So is 125 pounds just where my body is telling me ""I'm done""? I've been lower in the past (even when not unhealthy), but with my age and everything, I'm thinking this just might be the progress I have and I should now be happy that it's maintaining the loss?

1moquc7,keto,Down 30 pounds in 2 months here’s what works for me,"Yesterday I made a post about going from 220 to 187 in the span of just over two months. I was getting lots of love, but also got some questions of what I’m doing to shed the weight. So I figured I’d make another post about what’s working for me to answer some questions.

First and foremost I am NOT a dietician, nutritionist, medical advisor, or doctor of any kind! This is simply my firsthand experience of how I’m losing some weight with a ketogenic lifestyle. 

Let’s go to the beginning. Keto flu is a VERY common term that I’m sure most of us have heard doing a quick search into this lifestyle change. Basically this is your body withdrawing from sugar and carbs. I won’t lie, the first couple weeks up to a month SUCKS, but look at it more with a curious mindset of “sugar and carbs can’t be good for me if it makes me feel this bad going without.” 

So what’s the cure for this “flu”? For me the best way to curb the symptoms was to gradually lower my carb intake instead of jumping straight in to less than 20 grams per day. When I started tracking, I limited them to 50 grams for the first three days, then down to 40 grams, and slowly down to 20 through the next week. The next thing I did was forced myself to drink about a gallon of water each day. I also use a keto friendly electrolyte drink mix I got from Amazon, and I find it helps with the leg cramps I experience at bed time. 

In the first week I didn’t count calories, but I did watch my carbs and sugar. Like I said I’m not a medical professional here, but I feel like eating more calories filled with lots of fat and protein also helps the keto flu symptoms. 

You’re going to feel tired, lethargic, sick, and worn down in the first couple weeks, but IT DOES GET BETTER. One morning you’ll wake up and after your coffee you won’t be waddling to the bathroom for a number 2 break, you’ll find yourself clear headed, and you actually have energy. Congratulations you’re now fat adapted and more than likely in ketosis! Look at yourself as a lean mean fat burning machine!

So what do I eat? I am probably the most boring person to ask. I find keeping things simple works best for me. I also have autism and my biggest thing is I like things to stay the same and love my routines, so I will happily eat the same thing every single day and never get sick of it. 

So here’s my main meals I make:

Quick side note - I don’t have a social life at all, so I simply don’t go out to eat and this means there’s zero temptation or pressure to cheat. This isn’t realistic for most folks, but again this is what I’m doing.  

Breakfast - I usually skip it honestly and just go with a coffee with keto friendly creamer in it. Sometimes I get really wild and add in MCT oil for a little boost of energy. HIGHLY recommend MCT oil if you want to add some quick calories. 

Lunch - spinach salad with a little ranch dressing, two hard boiled eggs, and two cheese sticks. This is every single day that I work. Like I said pretty boring right?😂

Dinner - keeping it simple again with a meat; burger, chicken thigh, pork, or for special occasions a ribeye steak. Along with the meat I usually steam broccoli or I’ll have a small spinach salad with it. I find somedays I feel weak so I’ll add in more calories with a couple fried eggs and maybe some cheese too. 

Snacks - I don’t snack much, but I do keep hard boiled eggs on hand for something quick. I also keep a bag or two of Macs Golden Cracklins for a good crunchy snack when I get the random craving for a late evening munchy. 

Now the fast track cheat code to a ketogenic weight loss strategy….intermittent fasting! I work two jobs, so I base my eating schedule around them. If I only work my main full time job, I’ll either do one big meal for the day or two smaller meals. On days I work both my jobs, I’ll have two meals and I’ll usually snack on some of those pork rinds when I get home since I worked off a lot of calories throughout the day. When I’m off both jobs I’ll usually plan a 48 hour fast, but I listen to my body; if my stomach is growling and I’m tired then I’ll eat, but if I’m not hungry I won’t eat just for the sake of eating. 

I think that’s the most important thing I’ve learned from doing keto this time around, I’m using food more like a fuel. You don’t fill up on gas in the car when you only drove 5 miles since the last fill up right? Maybe that’s a bad comparison, but you get what I’m saying here. 

Another important thing I’ve learned is don’t starve yourself. Don’t push yourself. This is a marathon not a sprint! If you’re hungry then eat. If you’re not hungry then do one meal a day. Simple as that. I find I don’t lose weight if I overeat and I find I don’t lose weight if I under eat too. There’s a balance to find, and the easiest way for me to find my groove is to listen to what my body is telling me it needs. 

Last tip. Drink water and drink LOTS of it. Get yourself a nice big 64 oz water bottle that keeps stuff cold and carry it with you everywhere. This will help with hunger cravings in the early stages of getting into keto as well. Like I said I use two servings of some electrolyte drink mix everyday as I find it helps with the leg cramps I experience, and somedays I’ll add a third or fourth serving if it was extra hot at work and I sweat a lot. 

As far as my calorie deficit goes or my macros, I don’t count really. I know that’s horrible advice, but I go crazy when I keep track of all the numbers and everything. I’d say my calories are around 1200 - 1700 a day depending on work schedule. Is this healthy? I have no idea, but as long as I have energy and I’m losing weight then I figure it’s probably ok. 

I know I missed about a hundred things, but this is the gist of what’s working for me. Feel free to ask any questions if you need me to elaborate on anything.

1mo0d3j,keto,From 275 lbs to 154 lbs Before… and Now I’m Back for Round Two – Thoughts?,"Male 35. About 3 years ago, I went from 275 lbs (125 kg) to 154 lbs (70 kg) over the course of two years. I did it slowly and steadily — mostly with keto, some intermittent fasting, and a lot of trial and error. It was life-changing.

But… life happened. Between work, stress, and getting complacent, I’ve drifted back up to ~227 lbs (103 kg). Now I’m ready to turn things around again — and this time I want to move faster while still keeping it healthy.

Here’s my current plan:
	•	Keto + OMAD (one meal a day) for simplicity and appetite control
	•	Keep calories tight (~1,200–1,400)
	•	Focus on nutrient-dense whole foods, high protein (~105–130g/day), moderate fat, very low carbs (<20g net)
	•	Gradually add light activity to keep metabolism healthy

My goal: 70 kg (154 lbs) in about 4 months. I know it’s aggressive, but I’ve done keto before and I know how my body responds.

Has anyone here gone for an aggressive cut like this? Any pitfalls I should watch out for, or tweaks you’d recommend?",2025-08-12 05:35:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mo0d3j/from_275_lbs_to_154_lbs_before_and_now_im_back/
1mnt3my,keto,Two months in and down 30 pounds!,"This is my second time doing keto, and I'm down to 187 from 220 after a little over two months! I started counting carbs and calories on June 1st, and haven't cheated a single time since. Intermittent fasting along with low carbs and low sugar is like using a cheat code for weight loss.

Dropping some weight is my main goal for this, but I forgot how beneficial it is for my mental health too! Anxiety is basically gone at this point. Depression still pokes its ugly face out, but I'm finding the lows I go through to not be as low as they used to be.

I'm waking up feeling rested usually 30 minutes before my alarm goes off, and not sluggish at work either.  Along with the boosted energy, I don't feel hungry 20 minutes after I eat, and honestly I don't even think about food throughout the day.

It's crazy the addictive effects carbs and sugar have on the brain. No wonder the withdrawal (keto flu) is so nasty!

There have been a couple weeks where the scale didn't move, but I'm happy I didn't cave in and cheat despite the frustration because both times there was a week of NOTHING then BAM I'm down 3 pounds out of nowhere. My advice is to stay the course and keep going. It sucks not seeing progress, but it would suck way more kicking yourself out of ketosis and resetting.",2025-08-11 23:43:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mnt3my/two_months_in_and_down_30_pounds/

1md6zwy,keto,Two Months of Keto,"This is a follow up to my [One Month of Keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lo847o/one_month_of_keto/) post I give my background there and what prompted me to start a ketogenic diet.  My goal here is to share my updates and observations after two months.

TL;DR: Lost 7 more pounds, feeling grateful and I have more energy.  Life is good.

  
My notes for this month:

* Weight: I am down another 7 pounds this month, down to 223 pounds from 240.  
* That's nearly 2 pounds per week, which seems to match what my tracking app (LoseIt) indicates I'd lose.  I'm in at least a 750 calorie a day deficit.
* I'm able to eat a calorie deficit because the ""food noise"" I'd have, the constant urge to snack, is gone.  I sometimes have to remind myself to eat.  It's definitely a new and welcome situation.
* My weight loss seems to happen in small drops.  I held at 229 for what seemed like a week, then dropped to 225 for a while and now dropped to 223.  I've learned that if the scale seems ""stuck"", just to be patient with the process and to trust my diet and calorie tracker.
* My fasting blood ketone levels are getting better, with readings going up to the low 1s in the morning with a few exceptions.  A good night's sleep (I'm on a CPAP) seems to make my numbers better as does some intermittent fasting (occasionally skipping breakfast for a 16-8 split).
* My morning blood glucose levels are getting better, provided I use my CPAP all night.
* My brain fog has lifted for the most part, unless I forget to eat for too long.  The electrolyte drinks seem to help with the fog and fatigue a lot.
* I haven't felt the energy levels that lots of people report on keto, at least the way I expected.  When I did Whole30 in the past, I'd get a lot of extra energy and mental clarity about 2 weeks in.  Like so much I had some trouble sleeping.  I haven't felt that way on keto (yet), but noticed something else...
* About 6 weeks in, my mood improved.  I started feeling grateful in ways I hadn't experienced in a while.  I also had energy and clarity to get things done around the house.  I took the idea of making 1% improvements wherever I could (which I think was popularized by the book ""Atomic Habits, which I haven't read).  I've been doing small things around the house and in my life, just small chores to make the house better and cleaner and it's made a big difference and my wife loves it.
* I'll admit, some of this is keto and some is life changes. I was unemployed earlier this year and getting a new job (a job I love) has helped my mood, and has given me the money to buy some small items to make repairs around the house.  There have been other positive life changes recently as well, but not all of that can account for my improved mood.  I've heard that ketogenic diets can help with mood and wonder what others have experienced.
* I also have the energy now to do more.  Weight loss helps along with being past the keto flu/fog that lasted for weeks.  If I had to start again, I'd for sure add more electrolytes to my diet from the start as that seemed to help.
* Another thing I've done is get better at cooking.  Keto has me preparing my own meals pretty often, so I've tried new recipes and have tried getting better at cooking overall.
* There is one common thread I noticed between this and other diets I've tried -- vegan and Whole30 in particular.  I didn't eat refined sugar and didn't eat as much ultra-processed food on those (like on keto) and had energy on those as well.  I'm going to take that as a lesson learned and to get free of those kinds of foods in my diet, keto or not in the future.
* My plan is still to go until Thanksgiving, where stuffing and pumpkin pie (yes it has refined sugar, but I'll make it from scratch) await and then pick back up on keto full-time after Christmas.  If I stick to it, my BMI will be below 30 before Thanksgiving and that is something I will be very grateful for.

Well, that's it.  Thank you for reading if you made it this far!  Hoping to give another update on the 30th of next month.",2025-07-30 13:44:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1md6zwy/two_months_of_keto/
1mczme0,keto,Self made electrolyte drink changed my life,"Hello,

I have a history of frequent dehydrations that escalate into diarrhea quite frequently, while Keto and Intermittent Fasting have made it worse to the point that the moment I finish eating my first meal, I immediately have to to the bathroom, for a non-solid number 2.
It could catch me basically anywhere.

Water along never made the difference and Electrolytes powders containing Magnesium Citrate have probably had a negative effect on my stomach as well.

After asking here, I decided to make my own Electrolyte powder using the main ingredients in their pure and best form.

2 weeks in, I have basically eliminated almost all discomforts and side effects, while drinking around 2/3 the volume.

Considering I’ve been obese since I was 18months old eating sloppy joes, I’m happy with where I am.  Between taking care of my elderly Mom, the 2 dogs, and being a travel RN who works nights, it’s really difficult for me to meal plan.

I know right now I’m not getting enough fats. And too many proteins.  Every thing I find seems so focused on the protein aspect, I can’t reach my fats goal. Especially if it’s supposed to be 70% of my caloric intake!!!

I eat from 6PM to midnight because I work nights. So I’m grabbing food on the run, in and out of the break room.

My labs are great, my weight is normal, but I’m creeping up.  I feel like daily I’m gaining.

1logyid,keto,Why is intermittent fasting seen as healthy but keto is called dangerous?,"
It’s funny how intermittent fasting is all the rage, but keto gets so much hate—even though they tap into the same metabolic pathways. Both promote ketosis and autophagy, and combining them often enhances the benefits (deeper ketosis, better cellular cleanup, improved metabolic health).

The real issue? Keto got a bad rep because people misused it—eating loads of processed meats, low-quality fats, and calling it “healthy.” That’s not what a proper ketogenic diet is supposed to look like. Done right (think whole foods, healthy fats, nutrient density), keto can be incredibly effective.

Just tired of seeing keto dismissed because of bad implementation or fear-mongering around fat/cholesterol. Nutrition isn't black and white. Context matters.",2025-06-30 19:35:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1logyid/why_is_intermittent_fasting_seen_as_healthy_but/

In 2 weeks, I’ve lost 2 lbs. The only thing I’ve changed from the other times is I’m running 3 times per week. while on keto.
I eat a lot of meat and eggs, so I’m generally protein heavy. More steak, and pure meat burgers and pork than chicken.  Vegetables I generally stay with broccoli or asparagus. Snacks is generally cheese, or pimento cheese spread, deviled eggs or egg salad or chicharrones or a keto friendly lemon bar.

Hi Keto-friends,

I’m new here — 35 y/o woman on a mission to lose about 15lbs and feel better in my body again. I’ve been doing keto for 30 days now with intermittent fasting (16:8), and even though I’ve been pretty consistent… I’ve only lost 1 lb. 😅 also I started to workout x3 week

I bought the Keto Mojo meter and my morning ketones are always around 0.3, sometimes I hit 0.7, but that was my highest so far. I eat within a 12–6 PM window and try to stick to clean keto — lots of veggies, eggs, salmon, olive oil, and healthy fats.

But something feels off… I’m starting to feel burnt out on fatty food, and honestly a little discouraged that my numbers aren’t improving. I’m wondering if I’m missing something?

👉🏼 Any good food ideas that are still keto but don’t feel super heavy?
👉🏼 Any tips for troubleshooting slow progress?
👉🏼 How long did it take for YOU to feel the shift?

I’d love to hear your stories — it helps so much to see how others make it work 💛

1l1vevv,keto,Health Issues Are Melting Away!,"Hi all! I just wanted to share my experience on Keto after 5 weeks. I'm a 41yr old male, industrial maintenance mechanic and so my body has been fairly beat up over the last few decades. Last Oct I was diagnosed with GERD caused by a hiatus hernia, after taking nexium everyday for over a year. My symptoms got that bad, that if I didn't take the nexium in the morning, I would be vomiting acid by midday. After being diagnosed, I was told I would be on PPIs for life. My Dr didn't seem concerned about this, but I certainly was. Fast forward to March 25', my back gave out at work and I ended up in hospital due to the pain. Had an MRI and it was discovered that I had 3x bulging discs in my lower back. With the GERD and now this, I was feeling truly depressed. At 6'2"" and 230lbs, I didn't think I was in that bad of shape, but was told by my consultant that I needed to lose 20-30lbs to help ease my back. I looked into keto and decided to jump in straight away. The first 4 days I felt terrible, with pounding headaches and extreme fatigue, but after day 6, everything changed. No more headaches, brain fog lifted, I was starting to feel great! I have 2 meals a day, and do intermittent fasting in between. Hunger has completely gone! After 2 weeks, my back pain was 90% gone, with no pain meds. What I also noticed was that my general aches and pains felt like they were melting away. I believe my body has been in low grade inflammation for years, to the point that I didn't notice anymore. I started taking apple cider vinegar as I read that it can help with GERD. As of today, 2nd June, I have lost 20 lbs, down to 210 lbs. I have not taken a Nexium tablet in 5 days, and have absolutely no reflux symtoms whatsoever.

1kx1bud,keto,Keto is CRAZY,"This is sort of a failure and a success story.

10 years ago I was 40lbs overweight and couldn't figure out how to lose weight until I tried keto. It was fun. I bought all the low carb tortillas, cheeses, meats, snacks, even chocolates that you could find and I just went at it. I lost the 40lbs in less than 6 months and managed to keep it off for years. 

Fast forward to 2023, getting out of the COVID funk and I'm right back up to those 40lbs. 

At this point I tried a bunch of different methods including working out every single day, calorie counting, buying a FitBit and intermittent fasting. It would work for a few days or weeks but I just couldn't sustain it.

I started Keto again in December of 2024 and as of today I am back down and rid of those 40lbs! 

Hopefully there will be no global pandemic to be my excuse for gaining it back this time lol

I will say that this time my willpower was way worse this time around and I had to get rid of almost all the food in my kitchen and only eat with whatever Eat Clean sent me that week. I found that restricting myself to premade meals led to me not having the freedom to snack which was my big killer. 

I know keeping the weight off is the most important thing when it comes to Keto, so that's where my focus lies. Sticking with the diet and the method that I know works.

Don't give up! There is a method that works for you, and you might have to keep trying different combos to find what it is. Failures happen. It may take a while but in the end it's more than worth it",2025-05-27 22:49:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kx1bud/keto_is_crazy/

Hi there,

Long story short. I am diagnosed with pre-diabetes despite a very active lifestyle, Intermittent Fasting, brisk walks after meals, weightlifting etc.
Eating what is considered a “healthy” lifestyle.  I know general healthy is not considered healthy in this group.  I mean more in comparison to the overall population.

So for me the only way I might beat diabetes is going keto or carnivore, Carnivore is out of question as the meat prices are through the roof here. But without meat it’s very difficult to buy calorie dense keto food for an affordable price. With my active lifestyle I just need my calories.

1ku1dk0,keto,The Main Portion of Keto Doesn't have to be hard.,"A few weeks ago, I came here wanting to check out Keto, but was put off that the main idea and only real crucial step of it was to limit carbs to 20g or less a day. I thought that may be too hard.

However now, that I am doing calorie restriction for weight loss, along with intermittent fasting, only eating two meals a day within a 12-6pm eating window (lunch at 12, dinner at 5, done eating by 6) 18 hours fast a day.

It's become quit simple, I mainly eat things like eggs, beef, chicken breast, and now a baby bell or two a day.

Lunch is typically 3 eggs and a small thing cut steak, or 3 eggs and a few slices of chicken breast. Like 2 carbs because eggs are only half a carb each.

Dinners are typically chicken breast with a side of veg.

I now hardly eat 10g carbs a day, some days even less.

I did by some sharataki noodles off amazon, so when they get here, I will try them out.

I mainly use mustard, hot sauce, and sometimes mayo (sugar free, zero carb) as my sauces now. Sliced chicken bread doused in franks red hot, is very delicious.

of course if you can get pork rinds, or find sugar free, 0 carb beef jerky, those are great. I literally had a bag of beef jerky for lunch today, because it was sugar free and zero carb, and I was at an event today, so couldn't cook at home.

I adopted a keto diet about 2 months ago due to a diabetes diagnosis about year ago, and really wanted to reverse my insulin resistance.  I've lost over 30 pounds this year from intermittent fasting and it really flew off when adopting a keto diet 2 months ago.  My fear was what it was going to do to my cholesterol, and that fear has unfortunately become a reality.

Just got my numbers and my LDL was over 160, and my doctor seemed absolutely terrified by this  Triglycerides were fine, and HDL was a bit low but not terrible.  I was expecting this to be honest, but was hopeful that my doctor would be knowledgeable/understanding of keto dieting.  To be fair, I think she was open to it, but I also don't blame her due to the current stance on LDLs in the medical community.

Anyways, the issue is that I think it will be difficult if not impossible to find a local doctor experienced in low carb dieting.  Despite my fasting glucose in the low 80s and a fantastic A1c of 4.7, she wants me to drop the meat consumption and retest in a few months to see if I need statins.  I honestly absolutely gutted and hopeless after being told this, as I otherwise feel great and I'm the leanest I've been in nearly 10 years.  I feel like I'm on that road of being a pincushion for the pharma industry.

Any ideas on finding a doc that can work with me and keto dieting?  I'm located in central NJ if that helps.

1kml8q8,keto,"123 kg to 100 kg on Keto – Now Struggling a Bit, Anyone with Similar Experience or Advice?","Hey, thank you community first.

I'm 32M, 199 cm. I started keto in January at 123 kg. Today I'm 100 kg.

I recently had a colonoscopy and gastroscopy due to weird lower abdominal pain that hits twice a day. Everything came back clean. The doctors said I probably lost weight too fast — and that my organs might not have had time to adjust. Bloodwork was perfect, except for slightly elevated eosinophils — no parasites, no allergies, and no diabetes or insulin issues. Electrolytes are also great.

I calculated my TDEE based on actual weight loss and food tracking — it came out to around **3400 kcal/day**. I was eating about **2400 kcal/day** and steadily dropping weight. I’ve maintained most of my muscle mass — been weight training for 14 years (though recently less, almost nothing during keto).

Also, I **love cycling**, which on keto is basically a no-go for me. Did only 2 rides of 15 km... MCT oil, nuts — they just don’t hit like carbs.

  
Throughout the journey, I also practiced **intermittent fasting (16:8)** and plan to continue with that going forward — it’s worked well for me.

To be clear, before keto I had a **bad relationship with carbs**. I’d eat one slice of bread and then finish the whole loaf. One candy? I’d eat the whole 500g bag. That total lack of control is what pushed me toward keto in the first place — it helped me reset.

Now, I’d like to find a better long-term balance. I want to **test** my upper carb threshold — to see how much I can handle without slipping — and regain some athletic performance while keeping my progress and discipline. 

  
Has anyone here gone through something similar — either medically or with reintroducing carbs?

  
How did you approach reintroducing carbs without falling back into bad habits?

Thanks again, and good luck to everyone out there putting in the work.",2025-05-14 17:33:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kml8q8/123_kg_to_100_kg_on_keto_now_struggling_a_bit/
1kivjif,keto,Help Me Improve My Diet,"Who I am: Male, 140kg weight, 43.4% BF%


Goal: 12-13% BF%, Weight does not matter


My current diet:

- 500g of boneless beef (approx. 1400cal) OR 1kg of boneless chicken (approx. 1200cal), once a day. I alternate between the two every day, I spread salt and pepper on top of them

- Zero sugar cheese (a block is 165gr, approx. 550-600cal, 11g carbs) (1/2 of a block/day)

- 4 chicken eggs (approx. 300cal)

- Stevia sugar substitute (0gr sugar, 3gr carbs/sachet, 1 sachet/drink, 5 drinks/day)


Yes, it's a combination of carnivore and keto diet. The idea is to combine keto's benefit of directly burning fat with carnivore's increased metabolism. I want to add intermittent fasting to it, too, but I haven't been able to do it. My parents buy and cook anti-keto food, and there is no stopping them, so it's hard to stick to only eating my food. 


I also usually have a cheat day every week, where I eat rice and chicken/fish. The reason is because I acknowledge that my diet is quite extreme and perhaps my body needs a rest once in a while.

I started keto and intermittent fasting 16:8 a week and a half ago because I'm a teacher and my vacations started on monday, and I'm tracking my stuff on My fitness Pal.
I'm 5""9/1m74 and was 212lbsish 96kg and I've been working out once every too days for the past 12 days between 1h and 2h. 

And importantly my Daily Calories are supposed to be 1990cal

How on earth do I never go over 1000cals
I'm not eating the same thing every day, and tho I'm eye balling stuff, I go by labels for quantity, and even add spices.

I can't be that stupid that I always underestimate. 

I have very little appetite and am forcing myself to eat more because I don't want to pass out at the gym.

Also I bought some supplements because I got scared I wasn't getting my nutrients.

So, at 1000cals, am I gonna pass out in the middle of the street and die? Is it normal? Or am I stupid and can't measure things to save my life.",2025-05-09 11:34:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kig96k/i_think_i_must_be_stupid/

I have used carbs restriction and 16:8 for a long time, but standing still on 205 - 210 lbs and can not get down. (F 166 cm, 58 y) I have been over 200 lbs for 30 years (approximately). So it seems my body think that I must stay there. 

I gain weight, I use Intermittent Fasting and restrict carbs, and go down to the same weight. 

I have used recipes from a blog in my native language who is Keto, but every recipe is loaded with butter and full fat cream. I like Hemp porridge. The recipe from that blog is: 1 serving of Hemp porridge contains 0,42 cups of full fat cream and 2 tbsp of butter. It seems that the intake of fat does not matter at all in the recipes.

Hemp porridge; Kcal: 328 - Fat: 31,1 - Carb: 1,8 - Protein: 8,8 *per 100 g.*.

I should stop following that blog? Can you suggest other blogs that is better for weight loss? I can read English and use a converter from US to European measures.

The Keto calculator say my intake of kcal should be 1600 if I want to *maintain* my weight, so I need to have (much) less kcal than that. My goal is to finally get away from obesity after 30 years.",2025-05-07 08:34:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kgsde0/counting_calories_on_keto/
1ke780k,keto,Looking for advice to stay on track. I need a win!,"I have been on keto in the past and lost about 70lbs then with only tracking net carbs and not even going to the gym (I was moderately active with my dogs and sometimes walking to work).

I went off it initially because of a terrible living situation and drama which made it hard to stay on track when surrounded by awful people etc.

So I restarted last April and did well for a couple months to then have another traumatizing event caused by another person.


Fast forward to this year. I started back up in March 2025 and have not eaten outside of the diet so far and I feel better.

However, I am feeling a bit lost as I am not making progress like I did or want to. I am also probably being unrealistic. Thank mental illness I supposed.

So the good part:

- My appetite is in check (I have an eating disorder so this is awesome).

- I don't mindlessly eat or snack. 

- I cook more (I do enjoy new recipes)

- I drink a lot more water 

- I don't crave soda and if I want bubbles I enjoy the Bubly brand seltzers but majority of my drinking is water (I don't like coffee, I don't drink alcohol, and I only ever have tea if I am making bullet proof tea and this is mostly a pick me up thing)

The part I am not happy with:

 - the scale. I know this is just a way to track here and there but I feel like the amount of progress I have made this should have improved.

- I can't tell if intermittent fasting is doing anything good or bad other then puting me on a schedule to eat and not eat (which I guess is the basic things for IF) I always did 16:8. I would fast from 9pm to 1pm the next day as I am not big on eating first thing in the morning normally.

- I don't notice changes in clothing fitting or anything else.



Maybe I'm just being too hard on myself but I want this to workout.

I have also been adding some physical activity to just get stronger: i.e. sit ups, weights, planks. And I walk with dogs.

My highest weight was 280lb back in 2019. I got down to 208lb then and then my ex ruined that and I gained back a lot (however my clothes mostly still fit). So April 2024 I was at 278lb and starring in March 2025 I weighed 250lb. And last week I was 240lb and this week I am 245lb (mind you I started my period this week so that may affect the random weight gain as I fluctuate 5lbs that time of the month).

I keep my net carbs under 20 and rarely hit 20 on a normal day. I make it a point to eat less processed stuff and majority of the things I eat are what I made from scratch. The only sweetener I use if I do use one is monk fruit as it does not make me feel bad or weird like others do.

Any advice?",2025-05-04 00:23:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ke780k/looking_for_advice_to_stay_on_track_i_need_a_win/
1ke5mja,keto,Trying to eliminate harmful foods from my diet with a continuous blood glucose monitor.,"Hi guys, I've been using a blood glucose monitor to analyze the foods I am eating to watch for what is  spiking my blood sugar unexpectedly. I was intermittent fasting until I got this monitor but have begun to test certain foods by themselves, give myself a 2 hour window to allow for the spike, and then try another food. What I'm wondering is what amount of spike should I be concerned with? Ideally no spikes would be ideal and many foods don't seem to spike me at all but if I eat any products with carbs, I do see my blood sugar rise. I don't see many in the keto community talking about monitoring blood sugar like this or what levels are of concern but I do see many talking about intermittent fasting & keeping blood sugar spikes to a minimum so I'm guessing that many just don't bother to test this way. 

Has anybody been using a continuous glucose monitor to test & what level of glucose spike do you find unacceptable? I've already determined that me and my best friend have very different spikes even when we eat the same exact thing. I seem to be very sensitive to carbs and he is not so much. 

So last night I ate some Caprese salad (mozzarella, tomatoes, balsamic vinaigrette, olive oil & basil) and saw a 30mg spike. I'm thinking this is too much. I don't eat this a lot & it's well under 20 carbs but the spike makes me think I should I be avoiding this in the future. 

Another concerning food was ham. 1 carb per 3ounce serving (it says on the package). I noticed a spike when I ate it with an omelet the other day so I decided to try one serving on it's own this morning and it spiked my blood sugar about 25mg. 

Are these small spikes nothing to worry about or should I be trying to eliminate foods that spike me at all from my diet completely? What do you think? ",2025-05-03 23:03:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ke5mja/trying_to_eliminate_harmful_foods_from_my_diet/
1kbm50w,keto,Plateau,"I was intermittent fasting for over 7 years 16:8
Before I decided to try extended fasting.
When I first started 16:8 - all the misinformation was - skip a meal & eat anything you want in your eating window.

I did- (and I also run) and I may have lost 5 lbs or so- but never lost weight but also never gained weight.


I was never a “big” guy ( my heaviest was still a bit under 200) 

As I learned and experimented more I started eating better… but still not good enough…
Then I started extended fasting
Done a few 72 hour - and got into doing 48 weekly.

Since these changes I lost about 20lb

Currently 

Weekly: I fast 48 hours straight Then omad 3 days a week- and sometimes 2mad on weekends Mostly in ketosis the whole time

(During some of the 48 hour fasts I run 5-6 miles) 

I think my body is either fighting weight loss or this is the new norm

I don’t over eat during my window. I eat mostly single ingredient foods

Considering I don’t eat for 48 hours straight a week - and considering CICO- makes no sense that I’m holding the same weight

While I look and feel better overall, some of the body fat/weight  refuses to leave 

What could I be missing?

I am intermittent fasting and eating in a 6 hour window, carbs under 25g, and less than 2000 calories daily. I'm pretty heavy on the carnivore side since most of my favorite fruits/veggies are carb heavy and I use a combination of bacon fat, beef tallow, and butter for my fat supply, the past week I stopped eating extra fat to see if that was my issue. 

  
I feel good though, I'm already off my blood pressure medication (on it for 7 years), my A1C went from 5.7 to 4.5 in 8 weeks, my highest blood sugar spike in the past two weeks has been 130 mg/dl. I just seem to have hit a slump on the weight loss part, I was aiming for 200 pounds as my weight goal.

I have been ultra stressed in my job and my sleep hasn't been the best the past 4-5 months, not sure if that can cause issues. 

  
Am I just rushing the process, doing too much, or can these slumps just happen from your body reacting to the process? Thank you. ",2025-04-28 02:27:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1k9l0dc/keto_slump/

My sole purpose in doing keto is for weight loss but I’m also looking forward to weight maintenance. 

If you believe that IF speeds up your weight loss, would you say it is as a result of the fasting or simply because you eat less calories in a day?  I guess the same question would apply to those who do OMAD. Something I am not currently considering but never say never.

I kept it off for a few years but as life got in the way it slowly came back and then some.

I started keto a couple weeks ago, along with intermittent fasting (18/6). I’m currently working out cardio every day (peloton), and hitting ~1000 golf balls a week (I’m in the golf industry). In addition I was going to start reintroducing more weight training.

The thing is, I feel great. My recovery is better on keto than before, and my arm injury I was dealing with feels infinitely better. I have so much more energy than before. Yet everything I read says not to run such a large deficit. The thing is, most of them are talking about it being bad to consume extremely low calories, which I’m not doing. I’ve done it before with success, and am by no means starving myself, so it seems like there’s no reason to consume more calories than makes me full.

ng6b8a,vegetarian,Am I missing something in my diet?,"My diet contained around 50% of vegetarian meals before and I only used to eat chicken and fish, I didn't consume any other type of meat.

Two months ago I decided to go full vegetarian (including eggs and diary products) to see how my body would respond. I also workout 5-6 times/week (a bit of everything, strength, cardio, mobility, hypertrophy) and after these two months I started to feel a bit weaker. Not only my strength reduced but my endurance as well.

I'm very concerned about my protein intake, therefore my meals are always thoughtful when it comes to protein. They may consist on beans, soy beans, chickpeas, seitan, tofu, tempeh, eggs, dry fruits (almonds, peanuts, cashew), yogurt, low fat milk, cottage/feta cheese and whey protein mostly. 

I also do 17h intermittent fasting per day but I do it for a long time, even before cutting meat/fish and I never felt any kind of fatigue/weakness.

I've done some research and found out that lack of B12 vitamin and iron may be one of the elements I may missing. Do you guys recommend any supplement?

Went vegetarian almost 3 years ago, I did it for animal rights/environmental reasons. I actually started it ""as a streak"" to see how long I could last without meat - it just ended up lasting a hell of a lot longer than I initially thought it would. I absolutely love one pound cheeseburgers with bacon, steak, sushi, yada yada. I still have a major craving for all of these foods 3 years later. Nobody in my life (outside of myself) is vegetarian/vegan. Everyone  comments on how weird/funny it is that I of all people am vegetarian. 

Anyways, my usual daily diet includes 9 eggs for breakfast and Gardein meatballs (60 grams of protein) for lunch (do intermittent fasting, so no dinner). These are okay but it gets so damn boring eating the same thing every day. I can't seem to find food that has (1) a lot of protein, (2) actually tastes pretty close to meat (most vegetarian/vegan meat are pretty bad imho), (3) is something I can easily cook up/microwave at work without much meal prep. I just find myself too busy to not do a daily frozen meal for lunch.

8mv7i9,vegetarian,Newbie question,"Hi guys! I’ve been a life long eater of animals. I’m attempting to transition to a healthy diet that causes the least amount of suffering. 

I’ve been doing dairy free grain-free whole foods for 4 years now and it has benefitted me greatly in terms of my health and physique. I’ve always tried to achieve equal portions of protein, crabs and fats. 

I have formulated a transition plan which will go as follows:

Phase 1: Exclude mammals
Phase 2: Exclude poultry
Phase 3: Exclude aquatic animals 
Phase 4: Exclude eggs

I’m currently at Phase 1. 

I practice 16:8 intermittent fasting 4 times a week and a 24hr fast 3 times a week. I intend to continue to do so even when I reach Phase 4. 

I am very physically active, exercising every day. 

So eventually I will be having a dairy free, grain free, whole foods, plant based diet. I do not wish to use supplements or fake meats or any forms of processed foods like tempeh and tofu. 

My questions are as follows:

1. How do I maintain adequate protein intake about (30% of my macros) on such a diet

2. Will I eventually really need to supplement with b12 pills? 

3. What is the minimum amount of aquatics/poultry/mammals I can eat per week to meet my b12 requirements before I need to commence artificial supplementation? 

4. Amongst aquatics, poultry and mammals, which group possesses the highest density of b12 so I can eat the least units of per week and still meet my b12 requirements?

I have been on an overall fitness progression starting January 1 2024 that has gotten me down 80lbs and into the best shape of my life in my mind 40's.  

For context I first started riding the stationary bike for low impact cardio and calorie burning, saw results and then incorporated intermittent fasting and food tracking, stuck with that for six months, then switched from bike to running and dropped food tracking as I had established new eating habits, stuck with that for six months then incorporated RR for strength training (got a new body, may as well use it), and I am now working on balancing my strength training with my running (about 25 miles per week towards training for a half marathon this spring).

I have realized that I need a formalized running plan to match my formalized strength training plan, and that ideally the two would be structured to work together.

Has anyone found a training plan that pairs RR with half marathon training?  I can kind of jam the two together, and take my time building up so I don't injur myself, but figured I would ask her to see where others have landed.",2025-01-22 14:19:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1i7c47d/recommended_routine_running_training/

The long term plan is a half hour a day of exercise Jan (Vest On), Feb (Vest Off), and then an hour exercise a day March (vest on), then repeat this process. While doing an 18 hour fast once a week and a 60 to 72 hours once a quarter as well. End of March is my next extended fast. (72 hours is the longest I have done and it appears from the research I have done that between 60 and 72 hours is the ideal time for an extended fast while intermittent fasting has some benefits as well)  
  
I have been running in a 30lb weighted vest twice a week for over 6 months now. I rotate one month on one month off. I run twice a week, 2 stretch days, 2 strength days, and one HIIT day (or abnormal body movements with a focus on cardio and stabilizing muscles).

The HIIT Workouts can be annoying in the vest as it is not as tight as I would like, the runs are not bad though but I would prefer it be more stabilized on my frame and thought a compression shirt would be ideal. I wanted to try this out in March but wanted to research and find out anyone else's experience before spending money.

I have no experience with compression clothing and am open to other ideas as well for my vest to be better fitted to my frame.

44 (almost 45) years old
72kg and 5 foot 11""
Plant based diet, plenty of protein from Seitan, Tempeh, Tofu, nuts/seeds, lentils, beans etc. I also started taking EAAs.
Intermittent fasting - I'm doing it as I enjoy doing it and it helps with my gut health, mood etc
Sometimes cold showers!

In the gym RR:

Pull ups 3 sets 7,6,5
Squats 60kg 3x5
Dips - really struggle here with form. I can do negatives fine, but then dips I cannot seem to hold the right posture, shoulders in place etc 3x7
RDL or DL 75kg
Rows, I can do these 3x8 on rings starting at a decline
PPPU - 3x8 and getting the lean forward further now.

I then do the triple abs of ring rolls outs, banded palloff and hyperextension. I added in some hanging leg raises here.

Once the above is done, I recently adjusted the rings to shoulder height, kick up forwards into an upside-down hang, tuck and finish a 'skin the cat' slow and controlled. 

I now want to start upping the ring skill work, so wanted to get some advice on all the above and what to do for the next skill. I'm enjoying the routine, but I'd like to start testing myself and maybe get some things going that will help increase the numbers above.

180jrak,bodyweightfitness,Proposition: 60 day core challenge,"Hey folks. I'm new to the community, but I'm about a year and a half into my fitness journey. Admittedly, I got a late start being that I'm 39 years old and have never really worked out until the last year and a half or so. It's been a lot of fun and I've seen pretty great results!

I'm 6'2 and have hovered between 225 lb and 230 lb. Since I got out of college. I've never really focused on fitness at all. A year and a half ago my wife and I transitioned to intermittent fasting and over the next 6 months I lost about 25 lb. Then I started working out heavy and lost another 20 lb. Now I hover between 100 and 80 and 185 lb. All of my fitness goals are callousinic based focused on mobility and movement capability.

One of the most transformational routines I've adopted is a 10 minute core routine I do about four or five days a week. It almost exclusively focuses on different variations on a plank. My core power is orders of magnitude stronger than it's ever been in my life. However, I still have a goal to reduce my BMI from around 23.5 to around 19. I want to get down to where I'm not only lean but also visibly fit beyond where I am.

To that end, I'm contemplating a new 60 day core challenge that will be predicated on 5 days a week of core focus. This is not a total lifestyle change and will not persist beyond 60 days because I know 5 days a week of focus on core is too much. But one of my calisthenic goals is to be able to hold a front lever for 30 seconds and my current core exercise isn't getting me there as quickly as I'd like.

If I can get 50 people to chime in that they want to launch into this core routine for 60 days with me, I will keep this thread going and post lots of detailed body measurements multiple times a week along with pictures and we'll see how far I can get toward my front lever goal.

I’ve been on Ozempic for my type 2 diabetes since Nov 2022 and have used it as a tool to manage my diabetes and overall food cravings.

After 3 months I completely changed my diet, now eat super clean and healthy, meal prep and have completely changed my relationship with food, intermittent fasting, hitting daily macros at a deficit and slowly losing 1-2lbs a week.  On a plan with my nutritionist, etc.  We set it up baed in my TDEE, BMR, etc.  I plan to increase 300-400 more calories a day the more I exercise and the more I add strength training.

 I’m finally down to 226 lbs, having lost 103lbs so far.  As weight has dropped, I’ve been able to increase my physical activity, waking about an hour a day at a brisk pace, mixing in cycling for about 30-45 minutes as hard as I can every other day.

I’ve also recently started following the stretching excercises in the RR and have started incorporating some body weight excercises…slowly.  Push ups from my knees, squats, etc every other day.

I’d like to start focusing much more on weight training…but after doing some knee push-ups I’ve realized just how OLD and out of shape I am.

I really just don’t want to get hurt and my goal is in 3-6 months, being able to get my body (and joints!) used to xercise again…especially after years of a daily sedentary lifestyle. 

I’ve read about the different techniques for push/pull workouts like the sheet on door trick, using a sturdy table for pull ups, etc.

Thing is we have an old house and I’m still really heavy.

I also don’t know where I could attach some wooden rings.  Maybe the neighbors behind me who built a sturdy wood swing set with concrete footers.  They sold their home and now the owners have no kids, much older, maybe I could ask them if I could use it for rings?

Anyways, are there any pieces of equipment that I could invest in that would allow me to more easily do push/pull routines?  If so, could you please provide?

I guess I’m also hesitant at my age and fitness level simply joining a gym (with little guidance), F45 fitness, orange therapy, etc and hiring myself or not reaching my goal of adding lean muscle, etc.

16u1c0m,bodyweightfitness,Title: How I Successfully Lowered My Cholesterol Without Medication,"
Introduction

High cholesterol levels had always been a concern for me. After a routine checkup, I was shocked to discover that my cholesterol levels had reached a worrisome 216, placing me in the red zone for heart health. My doctor immediately recommended cholesterol-lowering medication, but I was determined to take a natural approach to improve my health. With dedication and a few lifestyle changes, I successfully lowered my cholesterol to 199 in just two months, all without relying on medication. In this article, I'll share my journey and the strategies that helped me achieve this remarkable result.

1. Diet Overhaul: No Butter, No Salt

The first and most crucial step in my cholesterol-lowering journey was revamping my diet. I eliminated not only fried foods but also cooking with butter and using excess salt. These changes were essential to reducing my saturated fat and sodium intake, both of which are known to contribute to high cholesterol levels.

2. Fasting and Intermittent Fasting

I incorporated fasting into my routine, allowing my body to rest and reset. Intermittent fasting, which involved restricting my eating to certain time windows, helped control my calorie intake and improve my metabolism. It also encouraged my body to burn stored fat for energy, ultimately contributing to lower cholesterol levels.

3. Juicing for Nutrient Boost

One of the effective strategies I adopted was juicing. Freshly squeezed juices from a variety of fruits and vegetables provided a concentrated source of essential nutrients and antioxidants. These juices were not only delicious but also supported my overall health and cholesterol reduction efforts.

4. Load Up on Fruits and Vegetables

Fruits and vegetables became the cornerstone of my diet. I made a conscious effort to consume a colorful variety daily, ensuring I received a wide spectrum of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. These foods not only helped lower cholesterol but also promoted overall well-being.

5. Mindful Eating

I became more mindful of what I put on my plate. Smaller portion sizes and mindful eating practices allowed me to savor my food and prevented overindulgence. This led to better control over my calorie intake and contributed to my cholesterol reduction.

6. Regular Exercise (Minimal)

While my primary focus was on dietary changes, I didn't completely neglect exercise. Though I didn't engage in intense workouts, I incorporated light activities like walking, yoga, lots of sex and stretching into my daily routine. These activities helped maintain my overall fitness and complemented my cholesterol-lowering efforts.

7. Monitoring Progress

To stay on track, I regularly went to the gym for about 30 minutes, but I was not consistent. Some days I was not motivated. I would stay home and stretch but most important I would never sacrifice my diet, which means I would never eat fried food or a publixs sub. 

Conclusion

In just two months, I managed to lower my cholesterol from a concerning 216 to a much healthier 199, all without resorting to medication. My journey taught me that with dedication and the right lifestyle changes, it's possible to achieve significant improvements in cholesterol levels and overall heart health. By eliminating fried foods, cooking without butter, avoiding excess salt, embracing a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, practicing intermittent fasting, and staying mindful of my food choices, I not only avoided medication but also laid the foundation for a healthier, happier life. Remember, it's never too late to make positive changes for your heart health, and a natural approach can yield impressive results.",2023-09-28 00:34:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/16u1c0m/title_how_i_successfully_lowered_my_cholesterol/
15eww8n,bodyweightfitness,Why am I still fat,"I've spent this whole summer dieting, working out, and not losing weight. I'm 6'3"", 224. This was the weight I ended at after Army Basic Training and after a short backslide, I brought it back.

I CANT GO ANY LOWER. I still have a belly and manboobs! I've never not had these! I have a healthkeep scale and even after basic I was over 20% body fat!!!

This is ridiculous! I don't eat sugar, I've tried keto, paleo, intermittent fasting (like 3 different versions of it), just calorie counting, work out books, bodyweight work outs, running, mixtures of all three over the past 2 years since training, NOTHING HAS WORKED.

Sure I can gain fat on a dime. I stop trying for a day and I'll shoot right back up to the 230s. Is there something I'm missing???

Note: I did get down to 217lbs after Airborne school in the Summer, but that was after spending 8 hours a day outside in the 100+ Georgia Sun with fake parachutes filled with sand. Running around, climbing towers, and jumping out of them. Even then I drank some water and it came right back. Never lost the manboobs or belly.

Edit: I'm on no specific diet right now, just counting calories, feeling cynical about a lot of the special diets. Some with exorcise, I'm on a downswing after a summer of disappointment.

- 2000 calorie in take daily (am for less)

- 3 mile run daily, heat in Texas is 94-106 usually when I run

This is maintaining but not losing me anything, nor do I really expect it to.

A visibly big part of Ramadan that most people are aware of is fasting from dawn till sunset. We abstain from eating food and drinking water (and we try to abstain from being angry, speaking bad, hurting others.. etc you get the point) 

 The amount of hours we fast depend on our location but generally its between 17 hours to 13 hours long. For a lot of us fasting starts from near 4 am (we get up at near 3:30 am to eat, it's called 'suhoor')  to 6-7 pm in the evening. Then we break the fast at 6-7 it's called 'iftar'.

It's essentially intermittent fasting for 16 hours but without water.  

**The timings are different for different parts of the world**

I think it's a good way to hit reset on your habits, your inner self (outer self tooo). 

SO LET'S GET TO THE POINT, some of us keep fasts in the sub right? 
Share your best ways to train during Ramadan. 

To categorize, 
There's 4 types of people: 

1) the newbies or beginners who are on recomp- want to build muscles and shed extra fat. 

2) people who have been training since many years and want to maintain

3) people who are wanting to cut 

4) people who want to bulk (personally I don't think Ramadan is gonna be the best time to bulk, it's really hard to do that.)

5) the ones who wanna do cardio/HIIT to lose weight but I'm not including em since this is a BWF sub. 

One big question is what's the best time to workout?  

How to implement RR in our schedule?

113ybcg,bodyweightfitness,Gymrat to High Frequency Bodyweight Training - SHORT STORY,"I wanted to share a bit of my story!

I used to be a gymrat, my knees were often sore from squatting (tendonitis) and my elbows were sore despite my warm-ups (so there must have been some bad movement) .

&#x200B;

I used to take it in my head when I went on vacation or whatever to train. In short, it was becoming a hell for me, missing a training session was driving me crazy.

Because yes, at 27 years old, training is good but you start to have other priorities like making money and other things...

Now I carry around a pair of gym rings and I'm happy.

I have been doing the""Kboges"" style training for about 6 months now and the improvement is incredible !

[https://www.youtube.com/@Kboges](https://www.youtube.com/@Kboges)

I was quite in shape already (GYM) but I think I look much better since.

I started with the basic 100 push, 50 pull and 150 squats

Basically :

\- 50 squat - 3 sets weighted (45lbs-20kg)

\- 10 pull ups (neutral grips - easier on wrist/biceps - some valgus) - 3 sets

\- 10 deficit elevated push-ups superset with 10 dips or vice-versa - 3 sets

\- 10 pull ups (neutral grips - easier on wrist/biceps - some valgus) - 2 sets

\- 10 deficit elevated push-ups superset with 10 dips or vice-versa - 2 sets

Average rest time between set - 90s

Average rest time between exercices - 120s

I'm training EVERYDAY morningFor the progressive overload, I'm trying to push sets harder, add reps from 10 - 12 for pull ups

Adds superset for push movement like I do for the moment.

Now I'm doing it weighted with 10kg (every exercices) and will try to add 2.2lbs-1kg each months

I know the weighted part isn't sustainable for a long term (or maybe to a certain point).

I'm in the best shape of my life I think, doing intermittent fasting 16-8 was also game changer for me and 90s of cold shower every morning.Back pics : [https://imgur.com/a/MZflFeu](https://imgur.com/a/MZflFeu)

10qpozu,bodyweightfitness,Some advice would be great,"Okay so I’ve been intermittent fasting (22/2) for 29 days now. I started off 227lbs and now I’m 211lbs (I’m 174cm tall so my BMI is still in the obese range). I’m happy that I’ve found a way I can comfortably lose weight but I’ve seen online that apparently if I don’t do any training, I’ll lose weight from fat AND muscles (not just fat). For the past 2 days I’ve been doing this simple home workout everyday 

Morning
Press ups - 6 sets of 10
Chest press - 4 set of 15 (dumbbells)
Plank - 1 minute 
Leg raises - 4 sets of 12
Squats - 100

Before bed 
Plank - 1 minute

(I would go to the gym but I’m still really overweight for my height and I get so embarrassed at the gym, plus my local one is always so full of people everyday)

Can anyone tell me if this will work? Or if this workout is okay to do every day or do I need to rest to allow muscle to grow?

Some advice would be greatly appreciated.",2023-02-01 10:00:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10qpozu/some_advice_would_be_great/
ymy69c,bodyweightfitness,7 years bodyweightfitness and not much progress,"Hello everybody,

I'm 30 years old and train consistantly since 7 years (3-4 times per week). My progress (for strength muscles and skills) is not verry good and I try to fix that and hope you can helf me with that. I am 1,76m and 76kg \~16% bodyfat. I am trying to gain more strength at the moment and so I am increasing my weight slowly (2kg per month) wanted to go up to 80kg and then cut. But I am not sure if this realy is a good idea, because my bodyfat is already pretty high (I messured the bodyfat with a calipper). Bevore I started with weight gaining I was very consistend at \~72kg for years. Sometimes I cutted for the summer a little bit. 

At the moment I am able to do weighted pullups with 17.5kg 4 Sets, the first with 5 reps, second with 4 and 3 and 4 set I can do 2-3 reps and add negatives.  
Dips 4 Set of 7-8reps with 15kg  
Pistolsquad 5 Set with 6-7 reps each side  
wall assisted Handstandpushups (not completly to the floor yet) 4 Sets 6 reps, 4 reps , 3 reps + negative and 3 reps + negatives

Fells like no or just very little progress for a long time.   
My goels are to get stronger, learn cool skills(one arm Pull Up, planche (straddel or one leg) front and backleaver, human flag)  and looking more muscular. (Just for the sake of completetennes my main goal was and still is beeing healthy what I achieved. But getting more would be a great motivation to stay tuned).

I am eating very well, self cooked meals every day, much vegetables, lots legumes, some meat for lunch wholegrain bread or skyrr in the evening and nuts in between (\~50 - 100g per day) no breakfast I am doing intermittent fasting for the last 4 yeats, sind I never liked breakfsting very much this fits me very well.

This is all the sport I do

cycling to the office 4-5 days per week (5km each direction)

Monday  
Playing soccer with some friend for 60-90 min  
Thuesday  
weighted pullups  
pseudo planch pushups (I just realised my protraction isn't very good trying to fix it)  
Weighted Dips (just added a few months ago for more triceps and chest strength)  
Triceps extensions on rings (added because I din't felt the triceps very much after the dips) this were Ab rollouts before  


Wednesday   
Rest  


Thursday  
Skin the cat with 5sec Hold at tucked frontleaver and tucked backleaver position  
Handstand Pushup (still working on the full raing of motion, can't get to the floor atm)  
L to V Sit  
Pistole Squads  


Friday   
Rest  


Saturday   
Supersets (no added weights) I try to do as many clean reps in every time window as possible and only pause very short  
Pullups (30sec) and Bodyrows (30sec) 3 Sets  
Straight bar dips (30sec) diamond Pushups (30sec) 3 Sets  
Toes to the bar (30sec) Leg Raises (30sec) 3 Sets  
5min Jumping Squats

Sunday  
Rest

&#x200B;

I am thinking about replaycing the Saturdays workout with the Thuesday Workout or just alternating between the Thuesday and Thursday workout on the 3 days per week.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What are you're thoughts? What am I doing wrong? Maybe I just don't push my self hard enougth during training (always try to go to the limit with adding negatives and stuff but never the less I am not shure... since great progress is missing)? Should I adapt my plan a littele or switch it completly? Or do you see any other points I may never thought about? I am curious about you're thoughts.

wqv1em,bodyweightfitness,Help in getting from 20% body fat to maintaining 14% while gaining muscle mass.,"I'm 28M and 180cm/173lb. 2600 TDEE. I'm at 20% body fat currently and want to reach and maintain 14-15% consistently with decent shape, strength, and some visible abs/muscles with no intention of getting more jacked.

My diet:

For just losing weight 0.5 Kg (1 lb) per week, considering the daily activity that I'll do, Myfitnesspal and calculator.net are suggesting to roughly maintain 2100 calories with 128g Protein, 280g Carbs, 60g Fat. I have created a suitable diet plan with intermittent fasting for 16 hours and 8 hours of diet.

My current workout:

* For cardio, I have been swimming for 45 minutes everyday for the last 2 weeks and will be continuing to do so for the next 3 months with 6 days/week. 
* For body weight training, I was following DAREBEE's programs which included 5 sets of a combination of lunges/pushups/jumping jacks/squats/crunches, etc. I'm now ordering a set of adjustable dumbbells and thinking to follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fCKd-BQOhw&ab_channel=THENX) plan by THENX. **TLDW**: This plan has 35 seconds each of Curl and Press, Deadlift and Bent over row, Pushups, Dumbell Lunges, Burpees, Dumbell rear delt flies and ski's, Dumbell situps, Jump Squats. Anything that includes dumbbells has around 8 reps. 
* So, it'll be THENX's bodyweight training with dumbbells for 3 days a week every alternate day, and swimming 45 minutes for 6 days/week.


My questions:

1. Is my current workout plan (dumbells + body weight every alternate day and swimming 45 minutes 6 days/week) a good start for gaining muscle mass and losing body fat percentage simultaneously? **EDIT**: Any increase or decrease in the swimming or body weight training frequency throughout the week?
2. To gain muscles, should I adjust my macros (150g protein?) or calorie goal? Do I keep the protein intake and the calorie deficit the same until I reach the desired body fat percentage?
3. For dumbbell + bodyweight training, what dumbbell weights should I start with? I know each type of exercise requires a different weight but no article or Youtuber suggests the weights for each exercise separately. **EDIT**: Are 8 lb good to start with and 2 lbs good increments? Also, should I keep the weights the same for curl and press, dumbbell lunges, dumbbell situps, dumbbell rear delt flies, etc.?
4. For following the RR, I need the place to do rows, pull ups, and parallel bars. I only have access to the dumbbells. Is there any resource that can help me achieve the goal with just dumbbells and body weight training? I looked at RR initially and it seemed extremely complicated with squat progressions, dip, hinge, etc., progressions for a beginner.

Thanks a lot for the help!",2022-08-17 17:36:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/wqv1em/help_in_getting_from_20_body_fat_to_maintaining/

Current physique shots (slightly pumped, natural lighting):
https://imgur.com/a/k13TXEg

- 192cm tall (6'4"") and started calisthenics last year in April at 22 years old.
- Started at around 78kg (172 lbs) in April 2021, went up to 85kg in February 2022, got back down to around 78kg in July 2022 after cutting.
- Went with a ""holistic"" approach to calisthenics: strength, aesthetics, mobility, flexibility, general health, skills... All are important to me, which I am aware slows down my process in each one of these domains individually.
- Unlocked a few skills: muscle up (not strict yet), tuck planche, solid handstand, solid L-sit, half lay back lever, adv tuck front lever, one-leg dragon flag, elbow lever.
- Current max reps on the basics: 15 rings chin-ups, 25 push-ups, ~20 dips.
- Got a few injuries along the way:
  - ring finger strain (A2 pulley and/or lumbricals) that got me out of bouldering for 3 months
  - costochondritis during 3-4 months which made me stop training the back lever
  - light case of golfer's elbow in right arm, that I thankfully managed to keep under control by being very cautious
  - tweaky left shoulder that has been nagging me for years and still sometimes does, mostly on dips and rows (likely a rotator cuff weakness)
  - shoulder impingement (AC joint pain) probably due to too much pushing volume these last weeks
- My objectives for next summer:
  - Strength: +66% BW chin-up, +80% BW dip.
  - Skills: full back lever, handstand push-up, straddle press to handstand, strict bar MU, full dragonflag, V-sit.
  - Flexibility: improving pancake and pike for the straddle press to handstand and V-sit.
  - Hypertrophy: gaining 3-5 kg of lean muscle mass.
- My top 3 pieces of advice for beginners, whatever the goals are:
  - I know it's been said time and time again but it is just so true: **focus on the basics and be consistent**. Get good at regular pull-ups/chin-ups, push-ups, dips, rows, pike push-ups, L-sits, squats, don't add tons of accessory exercises to your program. Skills will follow and will be **much easier** to acquire once you have strong basics. I deem I do not have strong enough basics yet which is why I have not started specific work towards planche/front lever for example.
  - **Track your progress** with videos and/or photos and/or writing down your workouts. This is so important in order to have objective feedback on what you are doing, and it feels very rewarding to look back on your progress.
  - **Listen to your body**. This one may be hard to get right at the beginning, but once you have suffered a few injuries or bad experiences you start to understand what it means.

## The start: April 2021 - August 2021

I was not starting completely from zero: I had tried calisthenics during a few months when I was in high school around 2014-2015 (following the infamous ""méthode Lafay"" for those who heard about it), and had gotten decent results at that time (went from 2 to 8 max dips, gained a few kg of muscle) but eventually lost motivation because the workouts were too intense and I ended up **feeling nauseous and dizzy** at the end of every workout, to the point where I was often unable to complete them. It took me several years to get around that obstacle, but with hindsight I think my workouts were too intense and too close to failure given my level of conditioning at that time.

From 2018 onwards, I started picking up rock climbing/bouldering because a few of my friends were doing it, and that helped me build back a baseline of fitness, especially in terms of pulling strength. I would also do some push-ups or dips on chairs from time to time to maintain some pushing strength. During COVID, all climbing gyms closed so that's when I started doing home workouts a bit more regularly: during the first lockdown (Spring 2020), I would do bodyweight workouts (basics like pushups and pull-ups) ~2 times per week to maintain fitness for climbing, without tracking my workouts and always going by feel to avoid experiencing again those nauseous/dizzy feelings from highschool workouts. Although I did not gain significant strength or muscle during that period, it was at that time that **I really understood the concept of ""listening to one's body""** and thanks to this, bodyweight workouts became enjoyable again (which they were not in highschool).

From 2018 to 2021, I was mainly bouldering with a few bodyweight workouts sprinkled here and there when COVID forced climbing gyms to lockdown again. I got into yoga randomly at the beginning of 2021, practiced it pretty seriously for a month or two which allowed me to become a bit more mobile (I think that's when I learnt to touch my toes in a forward fold) and helped with back pain, but soon I found it boring and stopped.

I got **seriously into calisthenics at the end of April 2021**: I think I was already able to do ~7-8 pull-ups and ~12 dips at that time. I'm not even sure what exactly triggered the spark for calisthenics: maybe a mix of wanting to look good for the summer and seeing a few cool videos on YouTube (I think Eric Flag's channel is one of the first I discovered) or because one of my roommates was into it, I don't remember to be honest. In terms of skills, I had several objectives that I wanted to achieve by the summer: a freestanding handstand for at least a few seconds, the bar muscle-up, the L-sit and the elbow lever.

Until August 2021, I was not tracking my workout nor had I a structured training plan, I was just working out ""by feel"" and watching follow-alongs on YouTube (usually on Eric Flag's channel), bouldering ~2 times per week and practicing handstands a few times during the week. I did not make tremendous progress on my handstand (I even developed pretty severe wrist pain due to poor conditioning and too much volume at once) or muscle-up but it was a good way to ease back into calisthenics. Although I didn't achieve the other objectives, **I unlocked my first L-sit in June**.

A few training clips from that time:

## Becoming more serious: August 2021 - October 2021

At the beginning of August 2021, I decided to start tracking my workouts more seriously (writing sets, reps and rest times in a small notebook that I still use today) and to design my own program (instead of watching follow-alongs on YouTube). Obviously I made the mistake that every beginner makes: focusing on too many goals at once and wanting to add too many different exercises to a routine. So I designed a Push+Legs/Pull split with 7 different exercises in each session, with my main goals being elbow lever + hanstand in Push, and muscle-up + toes-to-bar in Pull. I quickly realized that I was doing too much too soon and that I needed to place the exercises I wanted to progress the most on at the beginning of my workouts, so I adapted my routine a bit (mainly removing stuff). The routine ended up being made of handstand drills with the wall, a few variations of push-ups (today I'd rather stick with just one variation per cycle), dips, a few variations of pull-ups (at least explosive pull-ups were a relevant variation for the MU), skin-the-cats, cossack squats and a few core drills (leg raises, L-sit, hollow body holds). With hindsight, that was still too much and I should have removed some more stuff. Nevertheless, I quickly unlocked the elbow lever in August and then managed to **unlock my first bar MU** at the beginning of September 2021 (no chicken-wing but with kipping) and **my first rings MU** (without having practiced it specifically) a few days after. See the training clips below for videos of those.

At the beginning of September 2021, I changed my routine again (I was starting to understand proper programming at that time) and opted for an Upper/Lower+skills split, with my goals being cleaning up my muscle-up, handstand and frogstand-to-handstand (this one I soon realized was an unrealistic goal at the time!). On my Upper days I would do explosive pull-ups, pike push-ups, chin-ups, dips, bodyweight rows and push-ups; on my Lower days (usually at the end of my bouldering sessions) I would practice handstands, L-sit, archer squats, hollow body holds. Of course this routine evolved a bit with some trial-and-error, but it was better than my previous one. Progress was pretty steady and linear during that time, nothing crazy: in a month and a half, my chin-ups went from 6/6/4/4 to 6/6/6/7 (with only 1mn of rest between sets, which was too low in hindsight) and my dips from 6/6/5/5 to 7/8/8/8, while improving form. I also started seeing some gains on my handstand balance, after having spent most of the summer working on form with the wall: I think this is when I got my first freestanding 10s holds. Last but not least, I began to take flexibility more seriously around that time, got my palms-to-floor pike and made some progress on my middle split.

A few training clips from that time:

## Starting lever training: November 2021 - December 2021

In November I switched up my program and decided to start working towards the back lever, chest-to-bar pull-ups and the dragonflag. I kept my Upper/Lower split but adapted the exercises to fit those goals, and for the legs I went from cossack squats to shrimp squat progressions. In those 2 months I got from barely holding a tuck back lever for 5 seconds to a decent 15s advanced tuck back lever, and unlocked my first controlled chest-to-bar pull-ups. I also got from a bad tuck dragonflag to advanced tuck dragonflag. I did not progress significantly in my overhead pressing though, because pike push-ups were not prioritized enough in my program. My handstand kept getting better: this is when I really fell in love with handbalancing practice, and with my wrist pain issues finally out of the way thanks to months of proper conditioning I could practice it more often.

## Weighted calisthenics and dirty bulk: January 2022 - April 2022

In January I started a new cycle: my skill goals were still the back lever and dragonflag, but I decided to focus more on raw strength via weighted chin-ups, weighted dips and pike push-ups (overhead pressing being my biggest weakness IMO). I also decided I wanted to put on some mass after not seeing my weight move in the past 8 months and started dirty bulking: spoiler alert, it didn't work. I tested my max at the beginning of January to see where I was at: +27kg chin-up (~+33% BW), +20kg pull-up, +31kg dip.

Around the same time I also got injured while bouldering and strained my ring finger. I stopped bouldering for a full month but did not implement a proper rehab protocol in the meanwhile: as a consequence, 2 weeks after I got back into climbing (although I was taking it easy knowing that I was still injured) I re-injured my finger in the exact same spot. I was seeing a PT at this time (mainly for my left shoulder which had been nagging me for years), but he was not knowledgeable on climbing-specific injuries so he couldn't help me with that. This time I took 6 weeks off climbing and implemented a proper rehab protocol in the meantime (basically loading the injured finger progressively with free weights, inspired by https://www.hoopersbeta.com/library/a2-pulley-manual-for-climbers and https://stevenlow.org/rehabbing-injured-pulleys-my-experience-with-rehabbing-two-a2-pulley-issues/), and this time it worked perfectly and my injury was soon completely healed. I also got COVID during that period, which impacted my training during ~1 week.

Just as I had recovered from my finger injury and had made good progress on my weighted chin-ups (4x5 at +10kg, 1RM at +33kg), I started feeling mild pain in my medial epicondyle, which I suspected was the start of a golfer's elbow due to too much pulling volume as I had just started climbing again with enthusiasm. I stopped chin-ups altogether for a few weeks (keeping just the bodyweight rows), then slowly reimplemented negative chin-ups and then finally regular chin-ups, but didn't go back to weighted: this cautious and gradual approach seems to have worked well because the golfer's elbow has not bothered me again since then.

Regarding pushing strength, I unlocked my very first half lay back lever holds at that time, and made some good progress on weighted dips (4x7 at +5kg). However, I started to feel pain in my sternum when doing these exercises: after a bit of research online I realized that this was likely costochondrits, which seems to be extremely common in people who do dips and/or back lever training. This led to me stopping to train for the back lever, and regressing back to bodyweight dips for a few months before going back to weighted.

The bulk was not a success: I got up to ~85 kg at my maximum in February, but judging by the pictures (see the bulk vs. cut photo comparison in the next section) most of it was fat. I decided to start eating less (without weighing myself or doing a proper cut yet) which brought me down to ~83 kg at the start of April.

A few training clips from that time:

## Back to basics and cutting: April 2022 - July 2022 (present)

The injuries (golfer's elbow and costochondritis) forced me to regress to bodyweight variations of the exercises, which I took as an opportunity to improve my basics and condition my body better before going back to strength-focused cycles. I also realized that my unweighted chin-up numbers had not really improved since October 2021: I could not do better than my 6/6/6/7 with 1mn rest between sets that I had done 6 months before. My overhead pressing was also still lacking a bit compared to the other movement patterns, so I decided to make it my top priority during a few months, in order to make some progress in my handstand push-up journey. Therefore my Upper program was really simple: pike push ups (4 sets, 5-8 rep range, 2mn30 between sets), chin-ups (4 sets, 1mn30 between sets), dips and bodyweight rows as secondary exercises + some bodyweight push-ups as a finisher at the end of the workout. I also decided to start doing a proper cut in April, with the goal of getting back down to 78kg in June: I bought a scale and started paying more attention to my macros and calories, as well as implementing intermittent fasting.

Regarding handstand training, I decided to focus more on kick-ups since it's something I had neglected until then, and made some good progress: I went from ~33% success rate in March to ~75% in July when warmed up and focused, but I still have a hard time kicking up consistenly especially when not warmed up or ""mentally prepared"" (e.g. if someone at a party asks me out of the blue to do a handstand, I am not confident that I can kick-up into it). I have also been practicing shapes (tuck, straddle, diamond) and some drills towards the press to handstand in the last months, making some progress there as well (I even got a tuck planche for free by practicing tuck press negatives!).

I definitely made some good progress on the basics: I hit 4x8 chin-ups recently (mid-July) which was a goal of mine for a long time, brought my dips to 3x10 unweighted then 3x10 with +5kg, and made some good progress on my pike push-ups (4x8 in an L-shape on the floor, I'll soon start elevating the feet). My lower body and core strength have also improved, although not super quickly as I only do 1 Lower session per week: I can do 3x8 full shrimp squats, and 4x5 135° tuck (half way between advanced tuck and half-lay) dragonflag reps.

Regarding the cut, I eventually reached my goal of 78kg not in June but in July. Nonetheless, I am very pleased with the result and the fact that I managed to stay consistent and stick to my initial plan, without ever starving myself. I did not notice any significant impact on my training or strength: I don't really feel stronger or weaker than before. Here is the before/after of my cut (April at 83kg vs July at 78kg): https://imgur.com/a/xDRUqXQ

## Flexibility

I didn't talk too much about flexibility since we're in r/bodyweightfitness and not in r/flexiblity, but as I said I took that subject rather seriously as well, doing some mobility work almost daily as part of my warm-up and then some intense flexibility work once or twice per week. Progress was rather linear with regards to the work I put in, with the exception of the pancake stretch: I have a hard time with this stretch in particular (my hips feel really stubborn), and I have probably spent too much time trying the pancake directly on the floor whereas I should have done more regressions instead (elevated pancake or seated on a chair), which resulted not only in slow progress but also frequent lower back pain due to too much spine flexion in the pancake.

## Conclusions and plans for the future

Overall I am pretty satisfied with the progress I've made this year, although my physique has not improved tremendously but that was expectable considering how different from a pure bodybuilding approach my journey was. Handstands have definitely become my favorite thing to practice although it was painful the first few months: my next big goal in that domain is unlocking the straddle press to handstand. Strength-wise and endurance-wise, I have made some decent progress but think I could have done better had I just focused on the basics from the start, and obviously the injuries (golfer's elbow and costochondritis) didn't help. Regarding skills, I have not achieved many and some goals I thought I would have ticked by now (back lever, dragonflag) are still underway, but I'm pretty confident I'll acquire those very soon since I'm close to the final progressions. Overall I do feel more fit, more mobile, stronger, and I tend to have less back pain than before (except when I go too hard on flexibilty work, especially the pancake has a tendency to destroy my lower back) although there may be a fair amount of placebo effect here.

This summer I plan on working out outside more and hope to finally get my full back lever as well as a cleaner bar muscle-up. During the next year, I'll keep making pike push-ups one of my top-priority exercises like I have for the past months, as I really want to unlock bent-arm presses and the handstand push-up. I plan to gain 3 to 5 kg of lean muscle mass (I won't make the mistake of dirty-bulking again) by next summer, which I believe is realistic as I am still fairly skinny. As an aside, I have started living on my own which will make it easier to keep my diet in check (I was living with roommates until now, and we were always eating together making it hard to stand to my own food choices). I can't wait to setup my ""home gym"" in my new apartment: I will invest in a squat rack and a barbell in order to add weighted squats and barbell RDLs to my Lower routine, among other stuff.

I am pondering upon starting a YouTube channel next year as well (obviously around calisthenics/mobility/handstands), most likely in French as I believe the French-speaking calisthenics YouTube game is still very open (as opposed to the English-speaking one which is almost saturated IMO), but this will require a lot of free time that I do not have at the moment, with work and life getting in the way. We'll see in a few months how it goes!",2022-07-23 19:23:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/w6bx7i/what_can_you_reasonably_expect_after_1_year_of/
sw9c7l,bodyweightfitness,Slow progress,"Hello, I was going to edit my previous post but it got taken down due to (I think) lack of information because I'm dumb. Anyway...

  I am 21 M. I weigh about 75kg. I have been going to the gym for \~5 yrs now (3 straight) and have been doing calisthenics for more than a year now. I started training for planche and front lever on August of 2020. I first did calisthenics during lockdown and have been continue doing calisthenics and integrated it to my free weight workout at the gym. I have observed that it's taking too long for me to progress/master either of the progression I have mentioned above. I am still at the straddle at FL and tucked planche, despite the training I have gone through for more than a year. I see many people mastering FL and other workouts at a shorter time. I am getting a little bit discouraged because of it. And even though I have been working out for \~5 years, I still don't have a chiseled body or a ""good"" body. I don't know if I lack nutrition, sleep, or if my workout isn't enough. What should I do to see better progress? 

My free weight training mostly consisted of Chest-Triceps, Back-Biceps, and Leg-Shoulders split and was a hypertrophy program (12-8 reps decreasing reps, increasing weight). When I did pure calisthenics during the lockdown, I trained for Planche by doing scapular pushups, handstands, and doing other ab workouts and balancing exercises. For the Front Lever, I trained by doing pullups, leg raises, and other ab workouts and progressing through the front lever. As of now, I can do the straddle front lever, although eccentric and improper form. I also bought the calisthenics rings and trained with it, doing pushup variations, dips, and front lever progressions on the rings.

When I started working out, I didn't much that's why I reckoned it was a diet issue. In year 3 of working out, I started to eat more to the point that I ate 5 meals a day. I did a dirty bulk and I got bigger. I started doing keto diet in 2019 since I wanted to cut. I ate a good amount of protein but didn't really track my macros and calorie intake. 

During the lockdown, I reached 78kg (my heaviest).  I started going back to the gym when it was allowed (September of 2020) On Sept. 2021 I had a body composition test and it showed that I was 77.5kg with 18.7 kg of fat mass, and 58.8 kg of lean body mass. 

I tried Intermittent Fasting as of October 2021 and tried changing up my program where I did HIIT as a warm-up and cooldown (so before and after my workout) and did calisthenics before my free weight exercises. Since I am doing a push-pull-legs split, I do planche exercises, muscle-ups, and handstand for push; front lever progressions, windshield wipers, abs, and dragon flag for pull, and single-leg squats for legs. My free weight program is a hypertrophy program (12 reps of 4  sets). As of January 2022, my body comp was as follows: 76.5 kg Body Weight, 61.2 kg lean body mass, and 15.3kg fat mass. 

I make sure that I get at least 7-8 hrs of sleep every day, but sometimes can't due to college stuff. I recently saw that there were people mastering the FL at only 6 months and wondered what I was doing wrong. Should I allot a day for a pure calisthenics workout? Do I need to add more workouts to progress faster? Sorry for the repost, was dumb (mostly just a lurker and did not think about the details). Thank you in advance!",2022-02-19 12:49:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/sw9c7l/slow_progress/
q5h2i7,bodyweightfitness,Need Advice on Pull-Ups Plateau,"Hey Guys,

So I've been doing the RR for about a year and a half and I've went from not being able to do a single pull-up to 3x4-6-ish pull-ups, depending on how fit/strong I feel on that day. I'm 25, weigh about 90kgs and am about 180cms in height. My diet is okay - I don't track any macros but I'm trying to loose fat by intermittent fasting. I drink plenty of water, try to eat a lot of veggies, protein and avoid processed food/unnecessary sugar/carbs.

Lately I've started to stagnate and plateau around 4-6 reps on pull-ups, this has been a problem for about 2-3 months. I always try to get 3 workouts in per week, usually I do 2 days of calisthenics following the RR and one day of climbing in a climbing gym. Things I've tried is adding extra sets of negative pull ups or arch-hangs after doing 3 sets of pull-ups until failure to increase my endurance during those exercises, but I just can't seem to get a higher rep count. I feel like I'm doing something wrong. I'd love to be able to bash out 3x12 pull-ups, another personal goal of mine would be being able to do a muscle-up, which I haven't even tried yet to be honest. 

I have a small group of friends that I've actually convinced to start working out with me, which has been awesome, some of the people I train with have been doing calisthenics for a while themselves and even do things like assisted muscle-ups, I asked them to check my form, according to them I'm doing everything correctly. I've also watched several videos on YT to make sure I'm not stagnating because of a wrong form.

Any advice/help would be very appreciated. How can I overcome this plateau? I apologize for any grammatical mistakes since english is not my native language. Thanks in advance!",2021-10-10 21:21:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/q5h2i7/need_advice_on_pullups_plateau/
pxevy1,bodyweightfitness,Help substituting running with body workouts,"Hey everyone! 

My name is Matthew and I am 21 years old. I used to do intermittent fasting with calorie deficit for weight loss but I am starting over after stopping for several months. When I do intermittent fasting with calorie deficit I usually run and do body workouts like push ups, sit ups, body squads, and burpees. In 3 months I would loose about 28 pounds. Now though, I have a few weight plates with a barbell and I don’t have access to a treadmill which was my main equipment for running since I used to go to a gym and I gained those 28 pounds. Coming back to it I want to eliminate running and substitute that exercise with something equivalent to it and more effective. I want to still be able to loose the same amount if not more.

ppcbfh,bodyweightfitness,"Doing the RR twice a week for 6+ years: a review (average guy, 32yo)","**About me and the RR:** *32 years old, 65kg, 180cm*

*tl;dr: A look back at how a 30-something dude implemented the RR in his life and what helped and happened.*

Yo!

I've  stumbled upon the RR when I was researching calisthenics. I think I was around 25 years old and while I was never overweight, I've certainly never been ""fit"". I started out doing the ""old"" RR (following along with the ""old""  [BWF-App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bodyweight.fitness.free&hl=de_CH&gl=US)), which had a lot of planks/isometric holds. That was the first time I've ever done something fitness-y in my life, besides the sports I did as a child. With many of the  excercises I had to start in low ""progressions""; in the beginning - for example, I barely managed to do 3 sets 3 dips (let's not talk about form, haha).

**Progress was slow, but steady.** I made some good investments in the first year or two, and bought all of the equipment mentioned at the end of the post. To me, they have been of incredible value; it was great having to buy only a handful of stuff for a low price (compared to, say, a gym subscription) that didn't take up much space and I like being able to use it differently as I progressed. For the last few years I've switched to the **""**[Progressive Workouts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.janzendevelopment.progressiveWorkouts.mobileApp&hl=de_CH&gl=US)**"" app** and do the ""new"" RR-Routine. ([iOS-Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/progressive-workouts/id1551617282))

What has been an extremely important factor in my BWF-journey: **Consistency**! I've realised early I won't be able to do 3 or more workouts per week (which would've been ideal, but oh well...), so I said to me: You ""*only*"" gotta do the RR twice a week, but you **have** to do it twice a week, no matter what.  Since I work in education, I'm lucky to have 12 weeks of  ""holidays"" per year (not all of them are actual vacation days, mind you). Those are rest-weeks, where I'm neither fasting intermittently nor do the RR. I think that helps for recovery and to not put too much pressure on myself. In the last 6 years, I've done the RR during those 40 (out of 52 yearly) school weeks twice weekly, with about 95% consistency (rough guesstimate).

I've plateaued with some of the exercises; I've been considering going for the ""weighted"" progressions, but I don't feel very inclined to do so. And in the last years I've made attempts to work towards the full planche, but I can't seem to muster the energy, time and dedication...

...which is perfectly fine, because here's one of the reasons I'm writing this  post: **To me, the RR is a well-thought out, very efficient and very impactful tool to** ***stay*** **fit, both physically and mentally.** I'm happy and grateful to be as fit as I feel right now and be without injury for so many years - *and I don't want to make it a race*. This subreddit can be quite intimidating, since many of you guys seem to be young, eager to challenge themselves greatly, and have started out doing sports early and seem to progress/build muscle quickly. I'm aware that that's a skewed perspective, and comparing myself only to the sucessful ""pros"" is a recipe for envy and unhappiness. But I wanted to use my voice as an ""average guy"" who made humble gains and probably won't turn many heads when going to the beach - but that's very much okay. **Right now, to me, the RR is about maintaining a certain level of fitness - a routine that keeps me fit, not one that pushes me to my absolute limits**. *I intend to do it like this for the rest of my life.* Sometimes this infuriates me, since it is and will continue to be a lot of work and effort. And despite it being a non-negotiable routine for so many years - it still requires willpower to start the workouts. Almost.Every.Time. But I'm glad I've found the RR, since I like what it does and how good it works - and how easily it fits into my busy life.

**I'm so incredibly thankful to all the good people who contributed to the RR, be it by helping to conceive and improve it or by making apps or knowledge free and available to all of us**. The RR and this sub continue to make an tremendous positive impact in my life and I'm grateful every week - it  has made my life better in many ways. After [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/e5i1ba/i_am_prepared_to_be_judged_like_the_lazy_ass/f9juvdc/?context=3) blew up a few  years ago, I've been approached by many redditors who started out as  insecure and hesitant as I was back then. Hopefully I've helped nudge some of them toward a healthy (and consistent!) approach to something that's often sorely lacking in our ""modern"" daily lives: physical exercise.

Cheers!

p9q1ex,bodyweightfitness,Struggling with overtraining/undereating and body fat percentage. Please help.,"Hey guys, recently I saw somebody post about not being able to get to their ideal body fat percentage wondering if it was just genetics and I saw the most advice being either: you aren’t cutting down as much as you think you are, or you aren’t training as hard as you think you are.

For my personal story I started out skinny fat about 6 years ago and since then I’ve tried a bunch of different things (intermittent fasting, regular calorie restriction, and all different types of training). I know the first assumption will be that I’m either eating more than I think I am or that I’m training less than I think I am. 

So in response to that In the process, I HAVE been able to cut down to pretty lean (will try to post pics) and see the scale drop too, but can’t get down to the body fat I see a lot of dudes having at the beach. There is always this one point that I hit where I just start to feel like absolute crap (tired mentally and physically, lower immune system, less aggressive, etc.) which makes me think I am crashing myself like people with SUPER low body fat but the thing is I’m NOT anywhere near where that level should be. I then stop cutting and roll my training back a bit to not jeopardize my health/lifestyle. 

If I just push through the feeling like shit and keep getting leaner will my body eventually get used to “the new normal” or what would you guys advise here? I’m not asking to be a pro-bodybuilder or even underwear model level (I know those guys juice and are only shoot ready for short periods of time). I just want a nice set of abs to feel at par with your average 20-25 y/o dude at the beach (I think they say this is like 10%ish BF). I don’t know what to do differently as I don’t want to be undertraining and overeating because then I won’t get any results, but I can’t seem to break through to where I want to go without feeling overtrained/underfed.

Edit: I’m 22M and have never gained muscle too easily. Also had some health issues growing up that I don’t want to reveal because they are personal but my body was never the same after I was 8 (became skinny fat around the same time as the health issues kicked in and have been fighting against it since).

Edit 2: I do train pretty hard (in my opinion of course), but try to alway take at least one day per week off as a rest day. As for cutting too sharply (I have aimed for 500 calories or less deficits per day).

Edit 3 lol: as for the quality of my diet. I admit, it was bad at first as I really only cared about calories in vs calories out. But after 6 years I try to eat almost exclusively paleo, so I am pretty much eating lean meat, fruits, veggies, and nuts.",2021-08-23 02:01:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/p9q1ex/struggling_with_overtrainingundereating_and_body/

I've lurked around here and some other subreddits for a bit and I've found good info from you all about things like losing weight and somebody said once for that, it's like 80% diet and 20% working out. But where I'm at, I'm looking to lose weight and gain muscle(if that's even possible) but I'm not looking to going to a gym or running. I'd buy a bike and put money towards things I need for home workouts. But I'm trying to avoid a membership at a gym. I am a male, 26 5""7 and 169 lbs(biggest I've been) But most of my weight is fat. I'm not too big but also I am uncomfortable with my body. Without too much ranting, I would just like to feel the benefits of taking care of myself as I've heard a million times how highly you all speak of good sleep, drinking water. Yanno working out and trying to be better than you were the day before. So I definitely believe there's truth to it and I'd like to feel better too and experience those things. The main thing holding me back was a concrete direction to push in. And because I'm doing this by myself and no buddy's want to. I just don't want to go the wrong way or make mistakes.(bad form, bad rest, exercises etc.) So what I wanted to ask you, was do you follow any YouTube videos? How do you stretch? How long do you rest and how many days on/days off and which of those days would be legs, arms, full body workouts yanno.. Also how are you eating and do you find a strict diet or intermittent fasting super important? Would you consider that important for me trying to lose weight and gain muscle? Could you help me? Anything is greatly appreciated and I don't expect to have it all figured out right away. I've worked out in the past for a few weeks at a time, but I would love for something to just stick to me and really grow over the next few months. Physically, mentally and emotionally. Thanks all :)

Tldr: I'm looking to get into bwf, and I am looking for help in what direction to go, I'd like to avoid gyms, pull up bars and L-sit rails etc. Stick to gravity to begin with and use the floor/table..

I am 32M and I feel the fittest I have felt in my life. My wind is up, form is great, endurance, strength, alllll good, the workouts have put me in a great place mentally too. Intermittent fasting every day, abs teasing me by vaguely saying hello in the mornings some days.

So of course it was only natural to break my wrist in an inline skating accident. Had an operation to put a plate in today, doc said I have to rest it for three months and there is a possibility I can never do pushups without pain again. That hit hard. 

I am going to dig out the turbo trainer tomorrow and do some indoor cycling and do a shit loads of squats. What else can I do that can keep my wind and strength up with zero impact to my left wrist? 

Also has anyone recovered from an injury like this and carried on with bodyweight?

ls8x0u,bodyweightfitness,Can we PLEASE stop giving teenagers dietary advice?,"I know this isn't normally within the discussions allowed on this sub, but I really feel this needs to be said.

I love this sub. I love the community and the fantastic advice that is given here. I love seeing people weigh in and help out beginners right the up to the very advanced who are getting stuck. 

The only problem I have with this sub is how we respond to teenagers. Can we please stop recommending they cut calories for the following reasons:

- they are growing and their calorific needs are different from yours
- their hormones are all over the place which can have huge effects on water and fat retention. 
- they are at a higher risk of developing eating disorders
- they most likely have little to no control over what meals they eat, outside of choosing not to eat.
- their days are possibly (non-covid times) very regimented with very strict school schedules of when they can and cannot eat. (I'm not saying this is right, but it definitely will influence *what, how much* and *when* they will eat)

I am a teacher and the amount of full untouched lunches I see being disposed of after lunch is crazy. There is a worrying amount of kids not eating breakfast in the mornings. The worst part about all of this is society has us trained to look for these behaviours in teenage girls, but the boys are also avoiding/skipping meals at much (if not more often) from what I can see, and it seems (to me) to be based on ill-advised fitness trends.

I have spoken to students of mine who have gotten intermittent fasting advice from Reddit and no longer eat until after the school day is completed. The reason I have found this out is because they were falling asleep in all of my classes. 

I know this advice is coming from a good place, but we need to realise teenagers don't always take the advice with a pinch of salt, and often take it to far more extremes than you would imagine. Many don't have the skills to research things themselves yet or make the best decisions for themselves. Many still believe that adults know it all, and they *trust* us. We need to be careful about what we say to them, and what guidance we give. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and good luck with your own training & goals.

Edit: formatting

Edit 2: I just wanted to add, there are some amazing responses to this in the comments (both those who agree and disagree). And many of you are right, there is also some fantastic dietary advice given. My concern was the over-simplified ""cut calories"" that often assume the person in question knows what a balanced diet is to begin with. Thanks again for being such a great community, and responding so thoroughly!

Many have pointed out some flaws in my anecdotes, such as there is a range of reasons why students might also through classes, not just diets and that US school lunches aren't the most nutritious or tasty (something I genuinely didn't think about as I'm not from the US), but I hope the rest of my point still stands, even without that aspect.",2021-02-25 15:21:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/ls8x0u/can_we_please_stop_giving_teenagers_dietary_advice/
liupce,bodyweightfitness,Working on toning the muscles at home. Need advice!,"So, I have been consistent in following intermittent fasting and have lost weight and looks I have reached my desired weight but would like to keep in check as well as working on toning the muscles.

Can I do it at home? (As many suggest me that only way to tone the muscles is gym and lifting weight.)

Can I do my abs exercises at home with some backpacks weight and see a difference? 

Also will the exercises done during the fasting window make a difference faster than working out at any time in the day?",2021-02-13 06:06:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/liupce/working_on_toning_the_muscles_at_home_need_advice/
lar4e9,bodyweightfitness,"46 years old guy in the beginning of RR - questions, questions...","Hi all,

And thanks for putting the RR together, whoever did it!

I have done it three weeks now, and I'm already a bit fitter, but I have couple of questions. First a little bit of background though:

I have a small child, who wakes up quite often in the middle of the night, so I cannot get enough sleep. The amount of sleep deprivation varies, and situation has gotten better, but nevertheless my lack of sleep is chronic, and nothing can be done about it, until my my child starts to sleep better. I think this affects my recovery a lot. If I have only one rest day in between training days, my next training is suffering from lack of energy. Two days seems to be enough, so I plan to move to two days a week instead of three.

My first goal is to get a sustainable routine and since recovery in this life situation is a challence, I have tuned down the program a little. If I manage to keep doing it week after week and get even minor improvements, that is an achievement in itself. Another related goal is to lose weight, mainly in order to quit snorring, since that is huge disruptor of sleep. My wife wakes up, and then she wakes me up, and nobody is having fun! I have already lost 10cm from my waist by doing intermittent fasting a'la 16:8. So that is going very well, but as you can guess being calory deficient and sleep deprivated is not a perfect match with maximal gains. But still, surprisingly, my muscles seems to be growing and I feel fitter in my day-to-day life. No need to maximize anything for now - something is already so much better than nothing.

Instead of three sets per exercise I am doing two. Also, I don't bother much legwork right now. As a youngster I was doing a lot of skateboarding and mountain biking, and I was even competing a bit in snowboarding (half-pipe). So there is something in my legs already and it should be easy to ""wake them up"" with exercise later. Upper body and posture has always been my weakness, so that is a priority now.

So, now to the questions:

1. I'm in a point where I can hold myself up in a dip position for something like 50-60 seconds in a first set and about 40 seconds in second set. However, I start to tremble already around 12 seconds point. I think that apart from trembling my form is quite OK until the end of 45-60 second time. But I don't know what to make of this? When is the right point of stopping the hold? When doing normal push-ups for example, I adjust the amount of reps about 1-2 reps short of what feels like maximum. But how to measure the right level for isometric holds? Also, I think that exhausting my arms in dips cuts down my push-ups. Would it be good idea to balance the amount of effort between these two excercises so that on altenate days I would focus a bit more on dips and the other days on push-ups?
2. At the moment I have two longer term goals: A) 10 chin-ups B) 1 handstand push-up. At the moment I get almost one chin-up, and about ten years ago I managed seven. So I think ten is achievable. But how about handstand push-up? Is it realistic goal, and how far in the future would it possibly be? At the moment I can do about 10 basic push-ups as a part of my routine.
3. My sets are not of equal reps. My condition of the day depends a lot on how I slept the previous night(s), so I do my first set with the aim to do at least the same amount as last time, and usually manage to do so, but then I may not have enough strength to do that much in my second set. Typically this would be something like 9 push-ups in a first set and then something like 4-8 in a second set.
4. Maybe my main question is: how to adjust the routine per week and per day basis, when you are a bit older guy, sleeping too little, trying to lose weight? I think I already have some control on this, but there is always the question if you are just lazy or truly poorly recovered in any particular situation. So if there are any rule of thumbs, or ways to measure your level in the situation of compromised recovery, I would like to know about it.

Phew, that was lot, thanks for reading this far! And thanks or any comments you might have!",2021-02-02 08:32:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/lar4e9/46_years_old_guy_in_the_beginning_of_rr_questions/

What kind of exercises should I be doing to both lose weight and advance my strength level to a more fit level? I’m not overly concerned with having huge muscles, just good functional strength and not to look “skinny fat” when I get down to my goal weight of 190. I have a big frame with strong legs, broad shoulders and a barrel chest, which I’d like to maintain, just a big ole tire around my waist. I’ve noticed my output is much diminished with almost ANY strength exercises if I eat before the fueling window and my soreness is through the roof.

jnwmw6,bodyweightfitness,7 months progress // 27 yo male,"   
Hi BWF, today marks 7 months since I’ve started calisthenics, so here’s my progress:

**Motivation**

After a knee injury in August ‘19, I was kept in bed until I got surgery in January ‘20. That was the moment I was sick of not being able to run like before. I was never a fan of the gym (lifting), so finding calisthenics made me say “THIS IS IT”. My arms are super thin, have had gynecomastia since my teenage years, and I really hoped I would grow my chest so the tissue would not be so visible as much. 

**Stats**

Age: 27

Height: 175 cm // 5’9 ft

Weight: Before - 65 kg // 143 lbs /// After - 67 kg // 148 lbs

**Progress pictures**

Before (April 2020) [https://imgur.com/a/upjpuVK](https://imgur.com/a/upjpuVK)

After (November 2020) [https://imgur.com/a/xW810hl](https://imgur.com/a/xW810hl)

**First months**

In April I started the recommended routine, so training 3 days a week, with almost no focus on legs, since I wasn’t able to use my knee post-surgery. 

Pull-ups story: I was doing the first 3 progressions for pull-ups, knowing that I am not able to do a single pull up. While doing the negative pull-ups, 2,5 months after starting progressions, a dude asked me “why don’t you try to do regular pull-ups?”. So the next day I tried and did 3 of them with good form!! That was mind-blowing to me!

In the first two weeks, I was very motivated to do this. The next month I really fought the thoughts of giving up, such a struggle. But never gave up, never missed a workout. After 2-3 months, the habit was implemented and I was leaving home in the morning, even if I felt lazy or not, it just became so normal to go out and train.

**Current workout**

I started developing a lot of the upper part of my body, so my legs and butt really need some extra workout. Now I try to mix between barbell squats, leg press, leg extension, barbell hip thrust, glute, and hamstring extensions.

In August I started running little by little, and now my training looks like this: strength workout Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and running 5k + abs workout on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, with Sunday as a rest day.

I’m doing 3 sets of 8-9 rings pull-ups or chin-ups. Currently working for the one arm chin-up, it’s slowly getting there! I’m doing every time a set of decline, pike, regular and incline push-ups.

For abs: I do 3 exercises hanging on a bar, Copenhagen plank + regular plank, rings rollouts, ring reverse crunches, leg raises, and some other few exercises.

Still working on my hand-stand (80%), human flag(70%), and back lever (75%).

Now I have a few questions if someone is willing to give me some advice:

*Regarding rows*: I’m doing horizontal rows, but have plateaued - still feel fatigued after 3 sets of 10 rows, but have been doing for months now. What should I do?

*Regarding abs*: I’m not sure if I’m slowing my abs progress if I train 6 days a week intensively. Am I?

*Regarding dips*: I’m doing parallel bar dips, but I feel some pain in my shoulders. What’s there to do? This has also plateaued since a few months ago.

**Weight**

I started at 65 kg, and since I also wanted to build muscle, one of my mistakes was of course not eating enough and doing intermittent fasting. I stopped doing IF and eating much more (I’m not counting calories) - sometimes it’s exhausting the amount of food I have to eat, but hey, gotta stop looking like a little boy. Now I’m at 67 kg, eating mostly plant-based food, trying to have 3 meals + 2 snacks a day, with a protein shake before workouts.

**Conclusion**

I’m in love with exercising after almost a lifetime of avoiding it like the plague! The routine it has offered me, combined with 8 hours of sleep a day and a healthy diet, it helped me a lot during these tough times. I don’t wanna imagine where I’d be now without it!

The gynecomastia is still there, more visible than ever. Considering removing it, but waiting to fly somewhere I can get it cheaper than where I live.

Now that I look through the photos of when I started and recent photos, I don’t see a lot of progress like other people here, but I feel the photos don’t do enough justice for how it actually is in real life and how I feel now. What do you think about it?",2020-11-04 13:25:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/jnwmw6/7_months_progress_27_yo_male/

i0pqil,bodyweightfitness,Quarantine progress with recommended routine for 3~4 months,"**Stats**

23 years old/Male/1,67m height (equals aproximately 5 feet and 6 inches).

71.5 kilograms (157 pounds) before, now down to 63 kilograms (139 pounds) .

&#x200B;

**Background**

So, quarantine started around 4 months ago, and I was already getting too fat before of it. Because of that, and because of social distancing and stuff, I didn't want to go to gyms (even if they already have opened here), so I started researching about how to get somewhat healthier and bare minimum fitter at home with almost no equipment.

Then I found out this sub, and quickly started digging the recommended routine. I have already lifted some years back in the past (like when I was 16\~20) but I stopped after some time.

The reason I made this post is just to share my personal experience with the recommended routine for  around 3\~4 months. Im personally very happy with the results, even if it isn't a very impressive progress, I didn't thought I would have been disciplined for so far to be honest lol.

I want to really thanks this sub for creating a FAQ, routines and posts so well constructed, with precise and coherent informations. And I also want to thanks the active and well studied community that is always helping people with their questions. Everything here was really important for my progress so far.

&#x200B;

Anyway, here is the link with the two pictures, first with 71.5 kg, and then (some days ago) with 63 kg.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

Forgot to describe some needed info, sorry!

&#x200B;

**Diet:**

I stopped drinking sodas, juices altogether.  Started eating healthier and leaner food, like a lot of broccoli and cauliflower. I still enjoy fast food sometimes but it greatly less often. Also I eat a lot of chocolate still, it is the sweet food that I crave the most I think.

Also I fast for 12 hours everyday, so I think it is not called intermittent fasting yet. The reason I fast is because I read about how fasting can help stabilize the body's response to insulin, and a high insulin tolerance may contribute to fat gain.

But basically thats it, I didn't even count calories, I just wanted to get somewhat healthier and leaner than I was before, so I didn't really structure a diet... I just choose foods that are less caloric in general for my meals, generally, with less carbohydrates than before (but I still eat them, mostly in the form of fruits like bananas, oranges, grapes, raisins...)

I also drink Whey Protein powder for reaching that protein, around 100 grams daily for my weight.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Exercises Routine:**

Essentially the recommended routine. Started with the most basic of each exercise, and progressed with it the way it was explained, 3 times a week (sometimes 2). My only alteration in the routine is the core training, that I reduced to only doing L-sit for now.

&#x200B;

Pseudo planche push-ups 3x8

Pull-up 3x8

Split-leg squat 3x8 (both legs obviously)

Split-leg romanian deadlift 3x8

L-sit for 30 seconds x 3 (doing it hanging at the pull-up bar for now)

hlvzem,bodyweightfitness,6 weeks RR with intermittent fasting - help with hitting calorie surplus,"Hi All,
     I am early 40s male 160lb, 5'9"" and have been doing RR for 6 weeks (3 times a week) now and have gained considerable strength - from no pullup to 5 pullups, 5 dips and 10 pushups. Have been doing 16-8 intermittent fasting (with some 48 hour fasts thrown in every quarter or so). I am trying to hit a 20/20/60 (Carbs, Proteins, Fat) ratio since a while which gives me around 120gm of protein if I consume 2400 calories. My goal is to gain strength and I am not to bothered if I gain/loose 5lb here or there.

    Early 40s Male 160lb, 5'9""
    BMR = 1,621 Kcal/day
    TDEE with 4/5 days exercise = 2375 Kcal/day
    10% Surplus = 2612 Kcal/day 

Some comments followed by questions:

1. I am finding it hard to go all the way upto 2400 calories, and mostly peak around 2000 calories (can still get 100gm protein on 2000 calories) - especially when I include Whey protein powder I get too bloated to eat/snack MORE within my 8 hours window. 

2. My pull-ups and pushups are progressing well, and I don't feel that it is a lack of energy that is preventing more repetitions but basically lack of strength/volume in the muscles.

3. How can I judge if my protein (and calories) intake is enough - 

	a) Progression difficulty, visible muscle gain, how I feel after/during workout?

	b) Do I really need to go all the way up-to 2400-2600 range, if I am seeing all of the above from ""a"".

	c) Is 100gm of protein enough for muscle recovery? I can't overdo much with meat as I have a history of gout.

4. Generally workout in fasted state in the morning/mid-morning before my first meal but after a coffee. I progress well, but my arms are tired by the end of it and I can barely finish the abs wheel rollout. Again I sense it is not the lack of nutrition but rather muscle recovery and strength. Should I experiement with workout after a small breakfast?

Please share an experiences of doing RR while intermittent fasting. 

Thank you.

hf96yw,bodyweightfitness,I got 11 pullups in a row when I was aiming for 10!,"I wanted to achieve 10 pullups because it’s a nice, round and even number. Then I’m able to do a simple 3x5 weighted pullup routine without exactly going to failure. Grease the Groove is the program I used to get this number since all the others didn’t work for me. This link explains it better than I ever can: https://humanmachine.wordpress.com/2007/06/22/grease-the-groove-for-strength/

I couldn’t do any pullups in the beginning so I started doing assisted pullups(I used the assistance machine) and negatives. Negatives are where you lower yourself slowly from the top, it’s really good for building fast-twitch muscle fibers and getting that power and strength needed to get the first pullup. Because naturally, if you can’t do any pullups strength is an issue. I couldn’t properly control the negative standing at the edge of a box near a pullup bar so I just opted for jumping pullups to get myself in the position for the negative. I would hold at the top for a few seconds to get control, and then slowly lower myself for a few seconds.If you can’t do any negatives at all, I would just focus on getting better at holding onto the bar. If you can’t hang on to the bar at all, you should probably do some lat pulldowns.

I didn’t really linearly progress the assisted pullups and negatives. For some reason, the assisted machine didn’t really scale right. 40 lbs of assistance felt much harder than 50 lbs of assistance even given the 10 lbs difference. And if I went up fast enough, the assistance machine would momentarily not be helping at all. If I could go back, I would just use assistance bands as they seem to feel more natural. So I just picked a number where I can do them with good form( I think 100 lbs was the number I used) and increased volume per week, as in more sets and reps. . Once I started adding volume, it ended up getting me from 0 pullups to 1 pullup very quickly. From there, I was just doing sets of 1 pullup all the time.

I didn’t do pullups literally every time I went to the basement(I rarely go there) or bathroom etc but I did try to space it out over the course of the day. For example if I got back from a walk, I would do a set. With the exception of the 9-pullup RM test, I never approached failure. That said, I did get a little fatigued sometimes but as long as most sets felt easy it never seemed to be a problem. That’s a point I was thinking about last night: If you’re getting better on your pullup tests, do you actually need to go to failure? If I go from 4-5 pullups and still leave a rep in the tank, does it hurt my progress? Does going to failure hurt gains in the long-run? Is it better to test every 2 weeks rather than one? Yet I think testing is still necessary, if only for the psychological benefit. 3 pullups gotta feel easy if you can do 6 pullups. My pullup log: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2TC-6a8Aj1uaBYezJbItTTXf7atloO8Ywc7E8MvgAChDi393vwiK7SsrEUsq_h525Fyq1ZxV4lB-s/pub

The hardest thing about pullups wasn’t the pullups or even the diet. It was the absolute boredom. It was a chore doing pullups every day, I’d sit there, thinking “it’s probably time to do a set” after a study session. If I could do pullups once a year and magically get better, I would do that. Doing weighted pullups gives me an excuse to do them 3 times a week. It seems like if you can manage the discipline, GTG can quickly improve your pullup numbers. I’ve been doing pullups on and off for years, and I can’t remember why I decided on 4 sets, if only because it was necessary to work, or if 5 sets was too much.Would I have gotten gains faster if I did more sets or less? I don’t really know. But it worked, so I guess “don’t break something that’s fixed”. If I could start over, I would try doing 2 sets a day because at least those 2 sets can be fresh as possible. 

For diet, I started off as fat at 5’11 200 lbs, 27M and dieted to 140 lbs and then over the course of this routine gained 5 lbs to try to build muscle. Before quarantine, I did Jacked and Tan 2.0. @200 lbs, I found my maintenance calories to be 3500. I made sure to get 0.8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight and 0.4 grams of fat per pound of bodyweight (so for me it was 160 grams of protein and 80grams of fat) and put the rest of the calories in carbs. Then I did a 500 call deficit, eating 3000 calories per day. I only dropped calories  by 100 if I wasn't losing weight at all for a week. This slow approach was so I didn't get too hungry for school. Eventually I dropped it to 1500 calories. With the exception of chicken to get protein, and healthy fats like peanut butter, olive oil etc to reach my fat intake, I pretty much ate whatever I wanted following IIFYM. IIFYM was a godsend for me, making it much easier for me to stick to this diet. I also used intermittent fasting because 1 meal a day is really satiating.  This took me a few years. 

Methods to stave off hunger were copious amounts of diet coke, gum and vegetables.

I will admit that losing weight made pullups so much easier, it’s crazy how much easier it makes it. Other lifts didn’t really change much depending on if I gained/lost weight. My lats didn’t really get any bigger. I guess it wasn’t enough time for them to grow? I suspect weighted pullups are better for lat-development anyway. I experienced some elbow tendonitis in the later weeks so I looked at diet and added some protein since it was a shitty diet. I don’t think you need a perfect diet to get better at pullups as long as you’re not overweight and aren’t getting injured anyway. My sleep was fine, it wasn’t great but it wasn’t terrible either .For the future, the primary goal is: Do a pullup with 45 lbs. Secondary goal: See how it affects my bodyweight pullups. 

TL;DR: Do more pullups to get better at pullups. You don’t need to do a lot, just a few good sets will work and frequency is likely more important than volume.

Edit: I expanded more on the diet approach.",2020-06-24 20:49:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/hf96yw/i_got_11_pullups_in_a_row_when_i_was_aiming_for_10/

g6k4tx,bodyweightfitness,How To Train During Ramadan,"Hey guys! One year ago I wrote an article on how to train during Ramadan. Since Ramadan is close, I figured I'd share the full article here:

**Ramadan Mubarak! It's the time of the year where over a billion people start their month of daily fasting. In some countries this fast takes over 20 hours! Did we mention that you're also not supposed to drink water during that time? Yeah, it's pretty tough! This leads to a problem some of our Muslim friends face: HOW SHOULD I WORKOUT?!**

## Veteran

Don’t worry, in this article I’ll do my best to guide you through this Ramadan so that you can maintain or even enhance your training gains. As a Ramadan veteran who has successfully done multiple cutting and multiple bulking cycles, I do my best to teach you the ways!

## 1. Hydration

Starting off strong with hydration. Your primary goal during this month should be to stay hydrated. This is your most important goal, whether you are planning on working out or not. How do we do that? It’s rather simple:

1. By getting in plenty of water.
2. By preventing excessive water loss.

Let’s start by discussing the first point. What does plenty of water entail? To find out, [**use a water intake calculator like this one**](https://goodcalculators.com/water-intake-calculator/). The first thing you might notice is that you need quite a lot of water. For example, I weigh around 64 kg and need 3-4 liters of water per day.

I achieve getting that much water by making sure I drink about a liter each hour. Pro tip: It’s easier to drink water when having a meal. When you’re not eating, consider drinking something that is packed with electrolytes like coconut water. It’ll be much easier to get a good amount of water in that way. If you’re hardcore, get yourself an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and drink that. Be advised, it’s not the most delicious thing out there.

The second point is of equal importance. It’s extremely important to prevent excessive water loss. If there is a way to do something you want to do without sweating, do that! This probably means it’s a good idea to shorten or eliminate your cardio sessions. Your training environment is also of importance. You don’t want to be working out in the sun or in a gym without air-conditioning. Stay in the shades and find a climate controlled gym to prevent excessive sweating. Oh yeah, not sure if I should even mention this, but… like don’t go.. to the sauna okay?

## 2. Eat enough

Eating enough can mean different things depending on your goal. However, the general rule is: you should be eating an equivalent amount of food during Ramadan as when you’re not doing Ramadan. Nothing changes, you just have a shorter amount of time to get the food in.

**How to eat a lot**

If you’re planning on making mass gains during Ramadan, you’ll have to learn how to eat a lot in a short eating window. These are some tips to help you to achieve that.

1. Eat small meals frequently. A lot of people make the mistake of having a huge meal after they break their fast and stay full for the entirety of the eating window. They get 1000-1500 kcal in and stop eating for the rest of the eating window. This isn’t really effective if you’re trying to gain weight. Instead your meals should all be small and you should be eating every 45-60 minutes. Unfortunately not everyone has the privilege of staying awake throughout the entirety of the eating window. If that’s you, strongly consider not gaining mass but rather maintaining mass or follow the other tips.
2. Your last meal should be your biggest meal. In the previous tip we talked about having small meals frequently so that you’re able to get in more calories. However, your last meal can be a huge one, because you’re not going to have your next meal for a while. Just make sure to not vomit. It has happened to me and it’s quite possibly the worst thing that can happen during a mass cycle.
3. Eat foods that have a high calorie-volume ratio. Some foods are extremely low in calories even if you get kilograms in of them. Vegetables are good example of that. Try eating food that packed with calories like nuts. Junk food is also fine, just don’t overdo it and make sure you don’t miss out on your micro-nutrients and get too much sodium in.

**How to eat less**

Eating less is actually much easier for most of us during such a short eating window. Just do the opposite of what you should be doing to eat a lot.

1. Eat one or two meals only. Just calculate how much you need calorie wise and get that in having only one or two meals.
2. Eat foods that have a low calorie-volume ratio.
3. Drink protein shakes to feel full.

**Protein**

Make sure to not skip your protein shakes if you were taking them. Also strongly consider having around 25-50 grams of casein protein before sleeping. Casein is a slow-digesting protein that slowly releases amino acids. This means that you’ll have protein supply hours after you stopped eating!

## 3. Training goals

It’s easier to make more strength gains than mass gains when you have a short eating window, especially for bigger athletes. We strongly recommend you do to be doing a strength or skill cycle for this reason. Strength workouts are also shorter than hypertrophy workouts and require less hydration and nutrition.

This doesn’t mean you can’t do a mass cycle during Ramadan, it just requires more work. You’ll need to drink and eat more to able to benefit from it. If you think you’re capable of putting in the work without vomiting, then by all means go ahead. However, remember: the bigger you are, the harder it will be to do this. Be realistic and think carefully before deciding.

## 4. Workout timing

A question that I often get asked is: When should I do my workout? There is no clear answer to this. Research on intermittent fasting seems to suggest that timing doesn’t really matter. However, Ramadan is a bit different from a typical intermittent fasting diet. The windows are usually longer and hydration is a non-issue when doing intermittent fasting.

I personally prefer to have my workouts as close as possible before breaking the fast. I don’t feel like having to deal with being extra hungry and dehydrated for the entirety of the day. Instead, I’d like to workout and immediately break my fast and start eating and drinking.

Some people can’t do this. They feel too tired (which could be a sign of not eating and/or drinking enough) to have a workout when they’re deep in their fast. An option for them is to work out during the eating window. Have a small meal and do your workout an hour later. Some research seems to hint at a better power output when doing this compared to the first method. Nevertheless, there is a huge con with the second option: you’re sacrificing valuable time that could be spent on eating on working out. This might not matter if your goal is to lose mass. But if your goal is to maintain or gain mass, then it might not be the best idea.

## 5. Eat nutritious

Last but not least, eat nutritious. Our eating habits change completely during Ramadan. It’s very easy to have a small variation of food where you miss out on a lot of essential things like fiber and vitamins. The best way to prevent that is to eat as closely as possible as you usually would eat when not fasting. Supplements can definitely also help if you want to maintain a more flexible diet. The point of this paragraph is just to make you aware of that you’re making drastic changes in your diet and to be aware of that.

Hopefully this article was of use for you. I wish all of you good luck with your training and self-improvement during this month. Remember to enjoy it. Don’t forget why you’re doing it in the first place!

g3ncwt,bodyweightfitness,Unable to go below the 17-20% body fat,"Hello, for the past month, I've been trying to lose some weight and get as lean as I could, but every time I try to do that, it's like there's an invisible ceiling preventing me from advancing.

A few months ago, I was 92kg and after going on a diet on and off, I managed to lose up to 15kg which is the greatest achievement of my life, effectively going from 25% bf to where I am at now, here is a [picture.](https://imgur.com/a/2RgvVxe) Now I stand at 24 years old, 78kg, 176cm.

Now, I'm satisfied with the way I look, really, but I just know that I can do better and I want to push my body further, and most importantly, I just want to see my abs. Obviously I'm not very athletic, I did calisthenics and went to the gym on and off in the past, but building muscle mass or getting big is really not my goal here. My goal is to cut that last body fat, and as I said for the last month, I've been desperately trying to do that but I'm always unable to go for more than a week before crashing.

This is what I tried so far:

1. Eating in a caloric deficit  
I eat in a 500 caloric deficit low carb (but not entirely) and I try eating meat, eggs, bacon, rice, pasta, and so on, but all in really small portions. I'm calculating my calories and I make sure I get 1500 kcal a day. But after doing it for on average 3 days, I just start feeling fatigued, unable to concentrate, sleepy, and overall less energetic. Once I break my diet and start in surplus, I feel the most active again.
2. Intermittent fasting  
My eating window for the food mentioned in point 1 is usually between 14:00 to 18:00, then i'd fast for the rest of the day and night, and it is usually before 14:00 that I feel the dizziest. And after breaking fast, I get a surge in my blood sugar or smth which makes me sleepy to the point of napping. It's also worth mentioning that I take a multivitamin pill everyday and a vitamin C pill when I have smth important to do.
3. Working out  
I work out at home doing handstand pushups (15-20 in 5-7 sets), pushups, dips and so on and I also did HIIT for 10 minutes every workout day. It's a an abs and back workout and very beneficial for my back issues, but still didn't solve the body fat issue. I workout a day, then rest for the next 2.

Someone please suggest a personal experience on how they did and what advice they can give in my situation. I know it's hard. I'm really willing to put in the efforts, but I just ran out of ideas and solutions.",2020-04-18 13:17:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g3ncwt/unable_to_go_below_the_1720_body_fat/

# Blood Tests #

Doctor’s comment for April 2018 blood test…

> Your blood chemistry results, cholesterol levels and kidney function and liver enzymes were all normal. Your white blood cell count and platelet count were just below the normal range but it would seem unlikely those were due to diet. Do you have any previous labs for comparison, it is possible these are your normals for those tests but hard to know if you have no prior results to compare. These results would not produce any symptoms at this level.

Doctor’s comment for April 2019 blood test…

> I am pleased to let you know that your recent labs were normal. Your HIV lab also showed no infection. Your “t bili” was ever so slightly elevated though not significant in this context. Your other liver function labs were normal. Please let me know if you have any further questions about them.

**_No blood test taken for 2020 due to Coronavirus._**

# FAQ #

## Why are you only drinking meal replacement shakes? ##

A few years ago, I kept coming across news articles of people doing 30-day challenges with these new meal replacement products that claim to provide 100% RDI. That piqued my curiosity, and I wanted to experiment with it myself.

I lost ten pounds the first month. Excited about the progress, I wanted to keep going. What was meant as a 30-day experiment turned into a long-term habit. I’ve been on this diet for more than 3 years now and still going.

My main motivation is still curiosity. I think it’s a worthwhile goal to help determine the minimum system requirements humans need to operate. So by eating according to current RDI every day for a long time, I can see if I become toxic or deficient in any areas and we can adjust our knowledge.

## Which meal replacement are you using? ##

I use a product called Plenny Shake. I chose it mainly because of price. It also has a variety of flavors (mango is my favorite) and is plant based (lactose free).

Some other popular brands I considered were Soylent, Huel, and Queal.

To get my serving size and how much a meal will cost me, I used an online calorie calculator.

I kept the powder and water in separate bottles and mixed on demand. I used a food scale to consistently measure my meal sizes. I had to use a larger shaker bottle since my 1333 calorie meals didn’t fit in the free shaker bottle that came with my first Plenny Shake order.

## Did you take any supplements? ##

No supplements, drugs, alcohol, caffeine, snacks, cheat days. Just the powder and water.

## How did you measure your body fat? ##

I got one of those home body fat scales that use bioelectrical impedance. I know it’s not the most accurate, but it gives me a pretty good estimate. I tried to measure myself each time with similar conditions (right after waking up and using the restroom).

If my weight and body fat stays about the same for 3 to 4 weeks straight, I increase or decrease my calories by 10% depending on if I’m bulking or cutting.

## When are you going to eat regular food again? What will be your first meal? ##

I don’t plan on doing it forever. I think I’ll go 4 years max. I read an article that says it takes about 4-5 years to reach your natural fitness limit. After 4 years, I’ll probably still use meal replacements, but not 100%.

My first meal will probably be Hawaiian poke.

## What advantages have you experienced with this diet? ##

The biggest advantage about an all meal replacement diet is the convenience. Three major conveniences are:

1. Time
2. Money
3. Calorie tracking

In regards to time and money, I spend less than 30 minutes a day doing food-related things (meal prep, consuming, clean up). There is no traveling to get food, no waiting in line, no refrigeration, no cooking, and no wasted leftovers.

It is way cheaper than my previous diet that consisted of cereal, fast/frozen food, snacks, and home cooked Filipino dishes.

Also, I stay in my vehicle part time when I am far from home for several days, and powdered food has been a godsend in that situation.

With regards to calorie tracking, it’s stupidly easy to keep track of calories when you eat the same thing every day. Losing/gaining/maintaining weight is all about calorie management.

Being confident that I can control my weight at will is a great superpower I’ve gained since experimenting with this diet.

## What negatives have you experienced with this diet? ##

The biggest negative thing about this diet is the social aspect. Sharing meals is a bonding experience for most people, so I miss that part.  It is a bit awkward going out with friends, and I’m just drinking water while they are eating and getting drunk.   Also, people get disappointed when I deny food that they are offering especially if they cooked it.

## How do you handle cravings? ##

The first couple weeks was hard. But like most things, you get used to it after awhile. I went to bed hungry and woke up feeling not hungry which to me seems like my body was burning stored fat instead of recently eaten food when I went to sleep.

I experimented with intermittent fasting also which helped me control cravings.  I am able to do a 20 hour fast with a 4 hour eating window comfortably.  Most days though, I’m on a more conservative 14 hour fast with a 10 hour eating window.

It’s become so routine to me now that it’s just something I do like brush my teeth or take a shower. Not a lot of thought goes into it anymore.

I treat it more like a prescription… “Take three of these shakes a day to control your weight and stay alive. Adjust the dosage as needed”.

Products like these are the closest thing to simply popping a pill to give your body the fuel it needs to function.

## How is your energy level? ##

Energy level during cutting was noticeably lower than when bulking, but that’s the same with normal food as well.

As of now, I’ve never felt this fit in my entire life.  I don’t use caffeine and am able to keep up with my kids while working graveyard.

Also, I haven’t experienced any kind of brain fog or headaches.  I still feel sharp and enjoy learning challenging new things.

## What other physical activities do you do? ##

For my job, I walk around for about an hour. At home, I take care of my little kids. Other than that, no other major physical activity.

## What is your fitness goal? ##

My next milestone I'd like to reach is a FFMI of 23 which would have me at 215 lbs with 15% body fat. I think I can reach that by continuing to do what I've been doing.

## How are your bowel movements? ##

Skip this part if you don’t like reading about poop.

Before this diet, I was often constipated.  Now, I have a bowel movement at least once a day, and it goes out easily.  If I go right when I feel the urge, it comes out like soft serve ice cream. If I hold it for a long time, it comes out like logs.

Plenny Shake changed their formula in the middle of my experiment to contain less protein.  After the change, I noticed a vast improvement in the condition of my bowels.  I had far less gas and bloating, the poop doesn’t leave skid marks or clog the toilet anymore, and the smell no longer clears the room.

## What is the condition of your mouth? ##

I still stimulate my teeth and gums by chewing gum after every meal and brushing/flossing every day.  The condition of my mouth actually improved.  I get far less canker sores than I used to and my breath got better also.

## How do people around you react? ##

When people first hear about my diet, their knee-jerk reaction is usually disbelief. They can’t imagine something like this can be healthy or sustainable. However, after sharing my progress pics and blood test, they start getting interested. I’ve gotten quite a few people to incorporate modern meal replacements as part of their diet after they saw my results.

## Is someone paying you to do this? ##

No one is paying me to be on a 100% meal replacement diet. I consider myself an independent researcher, and I am meal replacement agnostic. If a more affordable one came out that still provides 100% RDI and can be delivered monthly to me consistently, I’d switch brands in a heartbeat.

## What advice do you have for someone who wants to try this diet and exercise routine? ##

My advice to people curious about trying such a diet would be to start off gradually.

Order a sample of different brands and flavors to see which one agrees with you the best. Then, replace one meal a day at first. When you are used to that, replace another meal and so on until all your meals are replaced.

Try it for 30 days straight, and I think you'll fall in love with the convenience. After that, you don't need to be 100% like me unless you want to help with the sample size of testing if our current RDI is accurate.

Most people will just want to use it to replace meals when they are busy. It's perfect for your boring and routine meals. You can save the other meals for special occasions with friends and family. Then you can just use a calorie tracking app like MyFitnessPal to make sure the other foods are kept in your daily calorie goal. 

For the exercise, I think keeping it short and simple is key into being consistent and will help people make exercise a lasting habit.  When you can do 2 short workouts a week consistently, then consider adding more exercise if you want.

The shortest path to a goal is a straight line. You can use this diet and exercise as a tool to quickly reach your desired weight.  It doesn't get much simpler than 1 food and 1 hour of exercise a week.",2020-04-15 15:27:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/g1u318/3_year_progress_with_100_meal_replacement_diet/

eco36c,bodyweightfitness,10 month journey from 12 to 20 pullups.,"M. 34. 
89kg / 196lb
192cm / 6""3.

In February this year I decided to get to 20 pullups,  and started documenting all my excersise.  I started with a max of 12. As of yesterday I'm finally at 20. You can see what I've done by checking out @regular_chins on Instagram.  

Video of the final result
https://youtu.be/nlKJAsDZCvo

Initially I went from doing basically no excersise, to doing light skipping for cardio,  and a few sets every day or 2 with my max reps of pullups.  That got me from 12 to 16 in about a month. Then I was stuck at 16 for about 8 months.  

During that time I added a bunch of pushups in to ensure balance and was going for somewhat i considered some pretty big numbers- 120 pullups and 240 pushups in 30 mins every second day.  I was only doing sets of 2 chins and 4 pushups every 30 seconds though. 

Most of that time I was going very low carb and 8/16 intermittent fasting. I was stable at about 89kg though. 

In the last month or 6 weeks I have gone away from low carb and IF, and dropped most of the volume from my pullups.  Doing a fairly standard RR workout every second day. 

The last month I have seen a huge jump from 16 to 20 pullups.

I'm super happy having finally got to my goal, I'm looking forward to improving other aspects from here.",2019-12-19 04:25:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/eco36c/10_month_journey_from_12_to_20_pullups/
e09y9s,bodyweightfitness,Progressing and developing a new routine: My Journey,"**Background:**

So I started my calisthenics Journey over a year ago and went all-in, I was athletic to begin with having played soccer and basketball in elementary and middle school and then skateboarded from high school until I was 23. However, my story begins far before starting my calisthenics journey. I was hospitalized after new years in 2013 and diagnosed with severe Crohn's disease. I ended up in the hospital for the better part of 5 years and was disabled for 6 months after being released after complications with an abdominal surgery. I weighed 236 lbs at 5'7 upon release.

During my time in the hospital I devoted all of my time to studying nutrition, to figure out a way to beat a disease that doctors were telling me I had no hope of beating. I've drastically changed my life, my nutrition, my regimen. I picked up calisthenics and devoted myself completely studying nutrition, training, and finishing my college degree. The first year of my journey I started intermittent fasting and cut out all processed foods, sugar, gluten, and all flour/bread products. Then I focused on revamping my gut microbiome, through the use of fermented foods and foods that are easily digestible, animal foods rich in nutrients and vitamins - I started making my own raw kefir, fermented veggies, sauerkraut, kimchi, etc. Towards the end of that year I got serious about calisthenics.

I started out at 5'7, weighing 236 lbs. Now I'm down to 140 lbs and feel better than ever but I'm looking to switch up my routine. When I was a beginner, for the first 6 months I trained 5-6 days/week and did full body workouts every day ranging from 30min to 1hr, high intensity. 

After I stalled out and hit a plateau, I went to a Push/Pull/Legs split. That worked for me fine until now. I'm looking to develop my calisthenics skills, as I feel my strength is plenty right now but I lack in balance and coordination. I started working on handstands and planche about 3 months ago and haven't made the progress I had hoped for.

My routine at the moment looks something like this:

(p.s. I do a stretching routine/yoga every morning and every night before bed)

&#x200B;

***Current Push/Pull/Legs split***

**Push Routine:**

Warmup (10-15 min) - Wrist warmup, Bear Crawls, Rolling pistol squat get-ups, Cartwheels, etc.

One arm Pushups (10-15 reps) 3-5 Sets

Pike Pulses (10-20 reps) 3-5 Sets

Pike Pushups (12-15 reps) 3-4 Sets

Wall-facing Handstand holds (50-60s) 3-5 Sets

Ring Pushups (10-15 reps) 3-5 sets

Hollow body holds (45-60s) 3-5 sets

Decline Diamond Pushups into Incline superset (10-15 reps each) 3-4 sets

&#x200B;

**Pull Routine:**

Warmup (10-15 min) - Wrist warmup, Bear Crawls, Rolling pistol squat get-ups, Cartwheels, etc.

I normally add dips to my pull day instead of my push day as a superset to my weighted pull-ups.

Weighted Wide-grip Pull-ups (6-12 reps) 3-5 sets

Knee raises/ Toes to bar (8-12 reps) 3-5 sets

Weighted Dips (6-14 reps) 3-5 sets

Tuck Lever Holds (15-30s) 3-5 sets

Body Rows, Alternating grips (8-15 reps) 3-5 sets

Hanging side knee raises (8-12 reps) 3-5 sets

&#x200B;

**Legs Routine:**

Warmup (10-15 min) - Wrist warmup, Bear Crawls, Rolling pistol squat get-ups, Cartwheels, etc.

Pistol Squats (8-15 reps) 3-5 sets

Single leg weighted calf raises (10-20 reps) 3-5 sets

Seated calf raises (30-45 reps) 3-5 sets

Single-arm kettlebell swings (15-30 reps) 3-4 sets

Kettlebell Squats (10-15 reps) 3-4 sets

Jumping split lunges (30-50 reps) 3 sets

Dragon flags (8-12 reps) 3-5 sets

Weighted step-ups OR box jumps (8-15 reps) 3-4 sets

I usually finish leg day with burpees and dumbbell bicep curl drop-sets, 3-4 sets of each.

&#x200B;

So that is my current routine, I grease the groove and do planche leans, hanging cats, and handstands throughout each day, I only take 1 day ""off"" each week and on that day I usually just work skills and/or go for a 6-8 hour hike up in the mountains on the Appalachian trail.

I want to get better at skill work and want that to be my focus going forward, which means I have to switch up my routine. This following routine is what I had in mind and I was hoping for some advice as this whole skill training thing is still relatively new to me, I'd love to hear from more experienced calisthenics athletes!

**Future routine:**

I was thinking of combining strength and skill work for 2 days straight, focusing on the fundamentals, then leg day, then 1 day of just skill work and repeating that routine. Something like this:

**Day 1+2 (Strength + Skill)**

Warmup (10-15 min) - Wrist warmup, Bear Crawls, Rolling pistol squat get-ups, Cartwheels, etc.

One Arm Pushups (10-15 reps) 3-5 sets

L-sit Wide-grip Pullups  (10-15 reps) 3-5 sets

Dips (10-15 reps) 3-5 sets

Decline Pike Pushups (10-15 reps) 3-5 sets

Tuck Lever/Advanced Tuck Lever (10-40s hold) 3-5 sets

Planche Leans (30-45s) 3-5 sets

Planche Pushups (8-15 reps) 3-4 sets

Wall-facing Handstand Holds (45-60s) 4-5 sets

Freestanding Handstands - 10-20 min

&#x200B;

**Day 3 (Leg day) - same as previous leg day routine, would love some suggestions**

Warmup (10-15 min) - Wrist warmup, Bear Crawls, Rolling pistol squat get-ups, Cartwheels, etc.

Pistol Squats (8-15 reps) 3-5 sets

Single leg weighted calf raises (10-20 reps) 3-5 sets

Seated calf raises (30-45 reps) 3-5 sets

Single-arm kettlebell swings (15-30 reps) 3-4 sets

Kettlebell Squats (10-15 reps) 3-4 sets

**Day 4 (Skill day \[Off day\])**

Warmup (10-15 min) - Wrist warmup, Bear Crawls, Rolling pistol squat get-ups, Cartwheels, etc.

Adv. Frogstand variations 3-5 sets

Wall-facing Handstand holds (45-60s) 3-5 sets

If this was your routine, what would you change? Any advice on optimizing this routine and progressing further? I feel like I've really stagnated the past few months and my handstand training feels like my progress has completely frozen so I wanted to make some changes.

c7bmkp,bodyweightfitness,Resistance band training on rest days?,"So I have started the RR about 3 months ago, and am progressing pretty well (thanks for putting that together guys, really works great!) But my pullups are still shit (just still to heavy at the moment i think, its getting better though! :D)

I have progressed to where i can do 3 the first set, 2 the second and 2 the third (the rest i do negatives).

Is there anything i can do on rest days to help me progress faster?

I thought about just putting a light resistance band up somewhere and do the movement a few times (like 20 reps or something) with a little muscle squeeze in the end. Is that smart or would it hinder my progress?

For context i run in the morning every rest day (maybe once a week i dont) fasted. Do intermittent fasting and am on a caloric defecit of about 300 kcal a day.",2019-06-30 10:26:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/c7bmkp/resistance_band_training_on_rest_days/

b3tp6l,bodyweightfitness,I (20 M) want to get down to 10% bodyfat,"Hello everybody, this is my first reddit post ever so please bear with me.

&#x200B;

I am 20 years old, 179cm (5'10) tall and weigh about 72kg (158 pounds).  I am not a complete fitness beginner, but neither am I really experienced. I started doing bodyweight fitness around 1 or 2 years ago with ups and downs, but the last year I was really disciplined and consistent. If the scale of my dad is to be trusted I am somewhere around 14-15% bodyfat. I have never measured it professionally, but my dad claims that the bodyfat percentage is somewhat near the results he got when he was in treatment.   
I would describe myself as rather fit, but not too muscular. I tried to gain some weight over the past few months and it worked fine.  Now my goal is to get down to 10ish % bodyfat to get to see my abs better and to have more muscle definition  in general.

I am going to start this journey or personal challenge with the 1st of April and I am trying to gather information. I am going to follow a bodyweightfitness program of one of the many athletes out there. The program is bodyweight based and a workout for the whole body, with emphasis on the abs and also on fat los. 

Additionally I am going to start doing intermittent fasting (16:8) again. I tried it before and didn't have problems with the not eating phase. During the last few months I ate around 3000Kcal a day. I know I have to cut them down now, but how far? Below the amount of Kcal I need a day including my workout routine which would be around 2400Kcal or is this limit ok or too far? 

Is it a goal I should aim for or will working out and developing my muscles further bring similar results? I know nutrition is actually the most important part about fat loss and I am trying to be disciplined with my diet, but do you have any recommendations for me? Recipes, foods or other things that are helpful.   
What's something I have to be aware of or you would have liked to know while losing fat? Do I need a ketogenic diet or something similar or is eating enough protein and being around my Kcal goal fine?   


As mentioned earlier, I am trying to get more information about the whole topic. That's why I appreciate everything you have to tell me. If you need more Information or anything just ask.

aau4mj,bodyweightfitness,4 things I learnt | Calisthenics body transformation (from fat to fit),"You might remember me from the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/a9fkad/3_things_i_learnt_from_0_to_8_strict_muscle_ups/) where I shared the 3 things I learnt from not being able to do any muscle up to doing 8 muscle up. There were comments asking how my body has transformed throughout the whole journey and how I managed to lose 20 pounds in the first three months. So I made this [video](https://youtu.be/71DZfivhxYw) ([https://youtu.be/71DZfivhxYw](https://youtu.be/71DZfivhxYw)) (start at 2:43 to see transformation)  showing how my body has transformed from November 2017 to June 2018 (hopefully just in time to be a motivation for 2019). Here are four things I learnt from my body transformation.

&#x200B;

**1. Diet comes first, training second**

This is banality. We all know about calories deficit. We just do not have the discipline to carry out the necessary changes to our diet. For me, the process has been brutal. I ate broccoli, chicken breast and fruits only in the first three months, with a cheat meal here and then but that's it. I put  all calories dense food off my sight and fill myself up with apples whenever I felt hungry. Intermittent fasting no doubt helped too.

Many of us have this excuse that if we eat less, we have less energy for our training, and we will eventually sacrifice our performance. That is only true if you are already a pro athlete who is in his cutting phase. But if you are a beginner, this excuse does not apply as we haven't tested our limits yet and more often than not, our beginner gains will take us to levels we wouldn't have imagined ourselves reaching.

&#x200B;

**2.  Find a sport that gives you sense of achievement**

Its not within my plan to pick up a sport when i decided to lose weight. It was my intention to lose weight simply by eating clean and eating less.But two friends of mine introduced me to calisthenics and this ties in perfectly with my weight loss journey. The more weight i lose, the quicker i progress in calisthenics. The quicker I progress, the more determined I am to control my weight so I wont lose these skills i trained hard to achieve. It is a positive feedback. So who says calisthenics is not for the heavyweights? Change our mindset and we could turn our disadvantage to our advantage.

&#x200B;

**3.   Try weighted calisthenics once you mastered your bodyweight**

I started with beginner bodyweight exercises (pull up, push up, leg raises) but it didn't take long before I noticed that I was doing them in high reps (due of dramatic weight loss and progress) and those exercises fell outside the hypertrophy range. They are good at burning fat, especially when I was doing them in circuits with minimal rest time. Yet it began hard to build muscle without extra load and tension.

So I immediately switched to weight calisthenics and harder progressions like handstand pushups, ring flies, high lsit pull up. That way my rep range fell back to 6 to 8 reps and results had been obvious. Now that I am at the stage of maintaining status quo, I do super sets or even triple sets with low to medium rep range so to get my heart rate up while building strength at the same time.

&#x200B;

**4.   Calisthenics as mains and weightlifting as supplements for the best aesthetics.**

As most calisthenics moves and bodyweight exercises are compound exercises (i.e. they target different muscle groups at the same time), doing these exercises seldom lead to muscle imbalance, compared to traditional weightlifting, where there might be more chance of doing isolation exercises, if done incorrectly, tilt our body to unnatural ratios. Not to mention the frequent use of core in calisthenics will make your obliques and rectus abdominis more obvious to the eye.

That said, there are still movements that bodyweight exercises can hardly stimulate or are often neglected. That include squats (quads and glutes), deadlifts (glutes and hamstring), flies (chest adductors), rows. Of course, we could do ring flies for adduction, front lever pull for rows. But they are either too hard to perform or there are better and more direct replacements in weightlifting. Thats why I suggest the incorporation of both calisthenics and weightlifting for the best aesthetics.

9650aw,bodyweightfitness,Gain Lean Muscle as fast as possible,"***TL;DR:*** 

* **How do i gain muscle and lose fat as fast as possible?**
* **I do weighted calisthenics and cardio 4-5 days a week**
* **I eat normally healthy, intermittent fast until late afternoon**
* **I dont want to take supplements or protein powders**

I've been dedicated to calisthenics for over 4 years, (about 3 years strictly bodyweight, and up until now i do weighted calisthenics with a backpack of weights), and have been gaining, but i don't think im gaining muscle as fast as i could. Like many of you, I started off really skinny (with a little fat), but now even though i've gained alot, i'd still be called skinny by many. Comparing my gains to friends and people I know that weight lift, it seems like they've been gaining muscle at a faster rate. I don't think its my workout (ill describe it later), because i believe its pretty vigorous, and i used to workout everyday, but now try 4-5 days a week. But i really think it might be something with my diet.

I dont believe in counting calories and meal plans for me, personally because eating schedules dont work for me, and its hard for me to be consistent. Which is partly also the reason i dont take protein powders, id rather just eat food, also because i think that would just be too much protein, and i heard awhile back that using protein powders for long periods can cause your body to be worse at consuming natural sources of protein. But i've tried the ""seefood"" diet, basically eating as much as i can, alotta protein too, but it just ended up making me very tired and made me gain more fat than muscle. So now i just eat normally, usually starting later in the day (like intermittent fasting), which have helped alot, but i believe i can do better. I eat healthy, i have more oils and saturated fats in my diet, most days i have little to no sugar, i only eat whole grain bread, spaghetti, etc, i drink milk, i usually eat a whole chicken leg everyday but i think i get most of my protein from everything else. 

So i don't know what to do to get faster gains. If i eat more than i do now, i gain fat and get tired. I wanna get rid of the fat in my midsection, but i also wanna gain muscle faster. I dont wanna take protein powder or supplements. Can i maybe substitute some of what i eat with more protein (any recommendations for a cheap protein source?)? but it may be just excess protein.

944eiq,bodyweightfitness,Buoyancy assisted muscle up and pike(?) planche in the pool. Also a brief progress report.,"Summer. Hot. Pool. Instead of laying in recliner with occasional dips in the pool I laid in recliner and [practiced L-sit, dips, muscle-ups and future planche](https://youtu.be/_9iuFaMz7z4). Also pistols (turns out I do not have to [lift my supporting ankle](https://youtu.be/12XOLF-SspU?t=1m40s), if I can lower my free leg while doing pistols) and climbing (this pool has climbing wall).  Among other achievements, this was the very first time I have done a jump-flip. Unreasonably proud of that. :-)

Since this video is an opportunity to show my current physique in shorts, a brief progress report.

M 56 5'10"" 190lbs.  

[This is me at 220lbs in November 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=222Bwy888hY). Had depressing summer, not working out and lots of carbs to get to this weight.

Diet. 

Sort of intermittent fasting: reduced meals to two per day, but no set interval between meals. Started to pay attention to portion size. Breakfast -- oats with milk, nuts and berries; tea/coffee. Dinner -- whatever I feel like with protein (eggs/fish/sausage/chops) and salad/whole grains side. Lost 30 pound in 6 months and stalled at 190lbs, probably because I had decided to experiment with creatine and whey protein. Both are finished now. I expect to start losing weight again soon. As far as muscle gain, they probably helped a bit. Hard to say since I also started more difficult workout routine at the time.

Workout.

[I have restarted 'You are your own gym' at beginner level in November 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=222Bwy888hY&list=PL71cpS872GXn5kS9nRf0d0rI51Mbs-1Gg&index=3) (have been cycling through this routine at intermediate level for a few years before summer 2017). Finished all four levels, including [Chief for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06of-XDmJ8s&list=PL71cpS872GXm9Gh7Hb5x9J3_rmjkwx2eq) (creatine might have helped here). Now doing Chief again with better form and substituting some exercises to target my upper chest, lats, overall back, and hams more. 

Motivation.

Health. Mirror. Shooting workout videos also helped to be consistent.

90z2az,bodyweightfitness,"Attempting to optimise a calisthenics routine around life and work, feedback welcome","Hey all,

I've been reading Steven Low's Overcoming Gravity (2e) and trying to put together a proper routine that fits me based on the info in his book/general advice I've picked up from watching Jeff Cavalier and Jeremy Ethier's YouTube channels (both of whom seem to have done real scientific research) plus generally attempting to listen to feedback from my own body. I've read the recommended routine in the FAQS here, but for a number of reasons I'll go into a moment think it doesn't fit me that well, and I've really tried to use Low's, Cavalier's and Ethier's advice to build something appropriate to me - so I'd really appreciate some input on whether it sounds like a good fit given my context, and any suggestions for tweaks to improve it.

**Context (ie me and my environment and some reasons why I'm deviating from the recommended beginner routine)**

37 yo male in fairly good shape (been doing untargeted gym sessions 3-5 times a week for most of the past few years)

Optimising for long term physical and mental health in equal measure - hypertrophy is a nice side benefit if I can get it without compromising the first two, but not a top priority

By far most motivated to train during my lunch hour at work, which means I have to get to the gym, change, change and shower at the end and get back to work within about 75 mins (preferably 60), which hasn't been nearly long enough for a full body workout, and also requires greater commitment to a precise schedule than my job allows - so while I've absorbed the advice on doing 3x weekly full body workouts, 6x (or at a pinch 4x with extra sets) weekly seems to fit me much better (also because on the push days I don't need anything from the gym, so can train in the park, or in the evening at home if work gets too manic for me to fit it during the day)

Also anecdotally I feel *much* less motivated in a given session if I try to make it full body than if I split them in half, and I get more of a happiness boost the more often during the week I can do a solid workout

Weak right knee, which I got some advice from an NHS physio on (he also recommended I do 4 sets for workouts in general, when I have the time)

Don't have money to spend on a personal trainer, at least not for regular sessions - would consider seeing someone a couple of times to check my form for higher risk exercises, but not sure how to find a personal trainer whose advice I can rely on (based in London - recommendations welcome) - but regardless, I'm trying to avoid exercises where slight form flaws could make them substantially riskier unless they're really indispensable (deadlifts seem on the cusp of this)

Vegetarian (nonvegan) diet

Experimenting with things like intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting, 5-2 and considering water fasting for 3-7 days (for their purported longevity benefits)

Mildly agoraphobic (prob not the right term here) in that especially when outside, if I angle my head back more than about 80 degrees  (ie lying face up on grass, or especially on an incline with feet above head) or forward more than about 160 degrees (ie in a pike position), I get anxiety (starting to feel like I've lost a sense of direction and could 'fall' into the sky), and the anxiety gets more acute the further back/forward beyond these positions I go and the more open space there is above me. In general I'm keen to conquer this, but it probably means eg I'm more tense than normal doing handstands, and at risk of throwing my head in a stupid direction if I fall out of them

Unbalanced towards pushing strength based on Low's scale - I'm transitioning to level 4 on the pushing chart exercises, and still on level 2 on the pulling ones. Wondering whether I should intentionally drop a pushing exercise from the list below to try and rebalance

I work at a desk all day, but have a standing desk that I use as much as possible (probably 60-80% of most working days)

I do Latin dance normally 2-3 times a week, which is a very mild exercise, though sometimes can go on intermittently for several hours

**Quantified goals**

(these are a little arbitrary, but I figured I should follow Low's advice on writing \*something\* down, though aside from the planche and outside handstand push ups, they don't have that much emotional resonance for me)

I've gone with Low's recommendation on Manna and handstands (though aiming towards pushups for the latter), and an even push-pull weighting for the remaining exercises. I found his advice on how \*many\* to have slightly confusing, so I've gone with a 1-1 relation between goals and strength exercises.

1. 5x free handstand push up outside
2. 30 sec 90 degree V-sit
3. 5x straight body 1-arm push up each side
4. 30 sec straddle planch
5. 30 sec full back lever
6. 5x pullover
7. 10x pistol squats (each leg)
8. 5x 2x bodyweight deadlifts

**Warm up**

* c15 burpees or c90sec skipping
* 15 wrist circles each wrist, each direction
* 15 arm rotations (both arms alternating directions, 15 each way)
* 3x Back bridge hold, c20 seconds, 3x 5-10 knee pressups on push day, 3x c10 second row warmups on pull day (haven't found a clear recommendation on what to do here while pullups are still part of my strength workout: I grab a vertical bar, lean back to full arm extension and raise and lower myself between full squat and as high as I can go before my arms aren't doing any pulling work. This at least \*feels\* like a pulling warmup, though considering I just made it up I wouldn't be surprised to discover it sucks)
* c30 seconds crab walk
* I want to introduce wall handstands, but without a training partner, given the agoraphobia issue I described in the context section, somewhat worried I'll end up injuring myself. I do often go with a workmate though, so hopefully will be introducing these very shortly
* I also want to introduce German hangs/skin the cat, but I'm not sure my shoulders are strong and/or flexible enough to do this without risk of injury, so reluctant to introduce them til I've done some more research on a good way to do so

**Push day**

* 3-4x 5-12 pushup progressions, currently RTO pushups (slightly higher than the 5-8 recommended in the FAQs here, but whenever I go up to a new progression I find my shoulders feel uncertain, so I'd rather play it safe)
* 3-4x 5-15 handstand pushup progressions, currently basic pike pushups (again slightly higher, since I feel uncertain in both elbows and shoulders - and hopefully this will also give me more time to start practicing static handstands in the warm up and generally getting more comfortable with the position)
* 3-4x 15-30sec total planche progressions, currently frogstands (though stuck on the transition from bent arm to straight arm atm, with the former being fairly easy to hold for 30sec unless I lose balance, the latter still impossible for more than a second or two if that)
* 3-4x 5-15 pistol squat progressions (again, given dodgy right knee, taking it very easy here)

This already tends to be uncomfortably long for a lunchtime workout, so I'm experimenting with a few variations:

1. removing one of the most dissimilar of these exercises from the gym - ie pistol squats, and doing it GtG on push days instead (GtG for me usually seems to be relatively light in practice - typically perhaps 80-150% of the number of reps I'd do in the gym in practice, since work/life tends to get in the way of doing stuff, though I'm hoping to be able to build habits to get this higher)
2. doing supersets of the most dissimilar exercises - maybe pistols/pushups and frogstand/pike pushups
3. somewhere between 1 and 2, moving one of the more \*similar\* exercises from the gym to GtG, eg pushups (and trading them for something more office friendly than rings, eg archer pushups), so that I have more dissimilar exercises to split between a superset, and then doing the third exercise normally with standard rest intervals

For most (both push and pull) exercises I normally to do last set to failure, with previous sets failure-1 (which has the big advantage of keeping me more confident about what failure-1 actually is) or 45-75 total seconds of isometrics.

**Pull day**

* 3-4x 5-8 pull up progressions, currently band assisted pullups, specifically aiming to bring my chest rather than just chin to the bar
* 3-4x 5-8 row progressions, currently transitioning from ring rows to wide rows
* Intended to be L/V-sit progressions, though currently I find they put too much pressure on my shoulder on a pull day, so temporarily doing L-hang progressions, transitioning from alternate legs raised to something like 3x4 10-20 second L-hangs
* 3-4x 5-8 deadlifts, currently 110kg

As with push day, this is quite long, so I'm looking at similar possibilities, though the logistics of GtG are harder - we don't have office equipment for rows, pull ups or deadlifts (though hopefully will be getting a pull up bar), but I have a set of paralletes, so experimenting with:

1. Moving L-sits to G2G (though that means they do have to be L-sits, and still have above problem of feeling like a shoulder pressing workout)
2. Doing supersets of the most dissimilar exercises - perhaps row & L-sits/hangs; deadlifts & pull ups

**Flexibility training (daily if I can, but usually not until the evening, well after my strength work)**

about 30-60 mins total of pancake, pike positions, lotus position, back bridges with arms as extended as possible (can't get full extension yet) standing single leg hamstring stretches (not sure what these are really called - keeping one leg straight and leaning forward) and shoulder stretches (arms behind me, palms on the ground, hands pointing back, leaning back to apply the stretch)

So that's it. Apologies for the length, but hopefully I've given understandable reasons for most of the controversial decisions, so that where/if I'm doing or considering doing something that makes no sense it will be easy to explain to me why I shouldn't be doing it.",2018-07-22 16:46:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/90z2az/attempting_to_optimise_a_calisthenics_routine/

kbsaw4,weightroom,"[BOOK REVIEW] Marty Gallagher's ""Purposeful Primitive""","Greetings r/weightroom

I think I have stumbled across a new near favorite book regarding getting bigger and stronger.   Wanted to share my review of it.  I originally posted this to my blog, but wanted it to be here as well, because I think more people need to read this book.

Let me start the review with the ending: this was a great read and I highly recommend it.  It’s only $8.50 on Kindle right now, which is what convinced me to get it in the first place.  I was originally looking for Steve Justa’s “Rock Iron Steel” book, which I intend to read soon, and this showed up as a suggested reading and when I saw the page total, cost and reviews I figured I had nothing to lose.

 

Unlike some of my other reviews, I did not take notes as I went, simply because, at nearly 700 pages, it would have made the reading process INSANELY long.  Instead, I’m just going to go over what I liked and what I didn’t like.

 

**QUICK REVIEW OF THE BOOK**







 

The book is divided into 4 areas of focus: lifting (iron), the mind, cardio and nutrition.  Each of the 4 areas are, in turn, subdivided into 3 sections: 1 that details the work and philosophy of the “masters” of that area, 1 that constructs a plan to implement the lessons FROM the masters for the reader to use, and from there a series of essays written by Gallagher regarding the topic.  I really enjoyed this approach to the subject matter, but it became a little obvious that the “essays” on the subject were just collections of previously written articles from Gallagher.  Nothing wrong with that necessarily, but I’m getting tired of “books” that are just a bunch of articles put together.

 

The iron section is the most expansive, taking up about a third of the book, but each section contains a large amount of information.  Nothing is skimped over or given lip service.

 

**THE GOOD**

 

-This is clearly a labor of love, and Marty put a TON of work into it.  I’ve been reading a lot of different books from different authors recently, and it’s become easy to tell who just slapped something together to get a paycheck vs who really wanted to put out a quality product, and this is firmly in the latter.

-This is a completely comprehensive tome.  One of those books you could give to someone and be like “Ok, you wanna know how to train and eat for the rest of your life?  Here you go.”  I love books like that.  Sure, it’s 700 pages, but it’s still so much time and effort saved to have it all in one place.

-Along with that, it’s a VERY easy read.  Marty is a professional author, having written for many publications, and his chops show on that.  It’s not his first time stringing together sentences.  He can attempt to get a little too eloquent at times, but he’s still very talented at his craft.  But along with that, he has walked the walk, with an 800lb squat and various lifting titles earned.

-Every section is VERY fascinating.  Marty’s “Purposeful Primitive” approach is all about stripping out complexity and getting back to basics, which, in turn, ends up going in some VERY unique directions.  I found the nutrition section particularly fascinating, as it basically splits between a dichotomy of very frequent eating of small meals or intermittent fasting via “The Warrior Diet”. 

-To go further into the above, Marty is big on Taoism and, in turn, duality.  His nutrition protocol fits right in there, but much of how he approaches training does as well.  It’s very much about how opposites compliment each other, and works itself out through some old school periodization. 

-Because of Marty’s unique position as an interviewer for magazines as well as a coach for some of the greatest strength athletes ever, he allows readers a very deep “insider look” ito some unique characters.  I’ve relayed this book as what Jamie Lewis’ “365 Days of Brutality” was supposed to be, because while Jamie wrote about what he’d read/heard about great athletes, Marty wrote about what he actually personally witnessed.

 

**THE BAD**

 


-On a few occasions, Marty tries to emphasize how badass he and his friends are in the lifting world, and it just comes across as either cringey or douche-y.  One particular section talking about New Years Resolution “mullets” was really just plain old off putting.  Paul Kelso did a much better job in Powerlifting Basics talking about how we all need to come together as iron brothers, and this was too much “us vs them” stuff.  It’s not often enough to detract from the overall quality of the book, but there were times I felt like abandoning the essay portions because I didn’t think there’d be anything worthwhile with that nonsense in it.  I was happy to be proven wrong.

-Marty sees cardio primarily as a fat burning device and is very big on employing a heart rate monitor to ensure one has their heart rate in the correct zone to employ this.  That’s a fine use of cardio, but as an athlete it didn’t gel with me.  Never cared for heart rate monitors, and my big emphasis is improved conditioning.

-The mind section contains a lot of helpful tips for how to psyche up for the big set in your training, and that truthfully goes against everything I’m about.  I save psyching up for competitions.  Marty’s claim is that you get more out of your training by tapping into this potential, but I find it’s a recipe for burnout.  In turn, I didn’t get a whole lot from the mind sections.

 

**SHOULD YOU BUY IT?**

 



Unquestionably yes.  No qualifiers.  Anyone with even the slightest interest in physical training should own a copy of this book.  You get a ton of value for your dollar, get to read about a bunch of different experts in different fields, and will be presented with at least ONE new idea, or find out you were mistaken about one you held before.  I thought I knew what the Warrior Diet was, and honestly, after reading the book, I genuinely want to give it a try someday, despite how much I’ve chided intermittent fasting.  I loved learning the logic behind it.  Same holds true with learning about how and why the great ones trained and ate the way they trained.  Add this one to your collection and share it with a friend when you are done, because it’s worth getting out there in circulation.",2020-12-12 16:50:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/kbsaw4/book_review_marty_gallaghers_purposeful_primitive/
jfh47x,weightroom,[Program Review] Brian Alsruhe's Next Level Linear: Cut short by lockdown 2 Electric Boogaloo,"**TLDR: Got stronger and more athletic. I would recommend to anyone especially if involved in a contact sport**

**Background:**

Was into sports particularly rugby and GAA, went to college and got fat. After a break-up, I lost all the weight in my final year and then started going to the gym on and off for a year or two before getting back into rugby just before I was 24. The way the Rugby season works is you only really have the summer to make any serious strength gains while the rest of the time you are slowly progressing. I wouldn't specifically say I am a strength athlete, I lift weights because it helps my sport and because I enjoy it, but right now rugby is my main priority. 

I spent a lot of time fucking around in the gym until I got a good program from the S&C coach at my rugby club, over the summer of 2018 I hit 200kg, a 185kg Deadlift and a 110kg bench. Rugby is a fairly rough sport and I have suffered quite a few injuries that have held me back in the gym, torn meniscus and quad which slowed my lower body development, a minor AC tear, a couple of dislocated fingers and a torn flexor tendon that required surgery also slowed down my upper body, and the main aim was always to get back playing rugby as quickly as possible. Only in late 2019 did I get back up to around a 200Kg squat and about a 220kg trap bar Deadlift, and a 112.5kg bench. I found Brian Alsrue’s channel about a year ago and loved his training style and decided to buy and run one of his programs this summer during the offseason, After talking with Biran (who is a gent by the way) we decided that the next level linear program would be the best one to go for. Sadly COVID hit so I had to start much later than I was planning. I finally got started at the end of June. Because I had only been doing bodyweight movements for 4 months was quite conservative with my 1Rm’s but I think I got them spot on, based on my first wave of testing 

&#x200B;

**The program:**

It’s probably best [explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d7eA6oKwdo&ab_channel=BrianAlsruhe) by /u/BrianAlsruhe but I will do my best to explain it here. 

You have 4 sections of training, each their own giant set. The program is divided into 4, 4-week “waves” the first one being light, then to medium, heavy and finally a testing waves, the reps change appropriately.

Giant set 1 rotates between testing, Heavey, medium, and light and follows Brian’s normal style of giant set, you have 30 minutes to work up to an XRm depending on the day you are on 

Antagonistic muscle movement

Main mover variation or competition on testing day

Core or obliques movement

Some form of Cardio

Rest for 90-120s 

The volume where you work at a % of your top set of the day and some core work as well

Assistance work, this can actually be some of the hardest work you do but really enjoyable 

Conditioning/Mindset challenges

I really did try to do these as much as possible, I started a rowing program midway through this program so sometimes I dropped a session. But he has some sick conditioning workouts, a favourite of mine was 3 burpees and 20 KB swings for a 10-minute EMOM with a mouth full of water.

**Diet:**

I ran this on a slight deficit but don’t really count calories if I am trying to lose weight. I normally do intermittent fasting which works well for me. Over the course of the program, I lost roughly 9-10kg. Probably look the best I ever have as well.

**Results:**

A couple of caveats:

1. I had planned to run this program completely during the offseason, but due to lockdown Gyms didn’t open until the end of June meaning I only had 2 months of the program in the offseason, I had to complete the last 2 waves while in-season. This program plus 2 Rugby sessions and a match all in a week was easy, but I wanted to get it done. 
2. We have gone back into lockdown in Ireland, so I only got to run 14 weeks of this program, we were given a 3-day notice of lockdown so I decided to run 3 testing sessions where I tested squat, bench and OHP. I had tested my Deadlift max the week before. Again not ideal, but it is what it is.

First things first this program is fun, really fun, I have never wanted to go to the gym as much as I have while doing this program, I think it’s because it’s similar to a rugby match, really hard but rewarding, it also physically mimics rugby as closely as any other program I have done with conditioning work in same giant sets. I followed it almost to a T, which was a slight struggle in a commercial gym, but thankfully it was a little quieter than usual after lockdown. There were a lot of moment variations that I hadn't done before, and some exercises I hadn't done before, but it was fun learning them. This program also had far more deadlifting than I am used to, I normally use trap bar deadlifts in a season as the position I’m in is hard on your back as is, so I try not to tempt faith. But I really enjoyed becoming more proficient at deadlifting, but I still prefer to squat. I would say that my deadlift was the lift that increased the fastest because I was relatively untrained in it.

&#x200B;

||Pre Lockdown  |Post Lockdown |Post NNL|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bodyweight |115kg (253lb)|120kg|110kg (242lb)|
|Height | 6’6”|6’6”|6’11”|
|Squat |190kg|180kg|215kg (475lb) (lifetime PR)|
|Deadlift|Most I had ever pulled was 185kg (405lb)|180kg (400lb)|215kg (475lb) (lifetime PR)|
|Bench|115kg (253lb)|110kg (242lb)|115kg (253lb)|
|OHP|70kg (154lb)|65kg (143lb)|75kg (165lb)|
|Trap bar DL| 210kg (462lb)|200kg (441lb)| 195kg x 8  (lifetime PR)|
|Pull-ups|7 |12 (all I could do)|15 and 3 +40kg|

 Overall this was by far the most successful program I have ever run, I added 75Kg to my total while on a cut, this would have been more if not for an injury, I was particularly happy with my squat and deadlift. My bench was flying for the first few waves but it really slowed regressing in wave 3 due to a shoulder injury I picked up in a match, at the end of wave 2 I hit 115kg for a triple and at the end of wave 4 I could only manage 115k for a single. This was an injury issue rather than the program, I believe if I could have completed this program full during my offseason my bench could have hit somewhere between 125-130kg. I am dreadful at OHP and it progressed very slowly but I expected that. The shoulder injury didn’t help. I would also say that I got far more athletic, front he conditioning and the giant set format. For the most part, I stuck exactly to the program although I did drop the conditioning on some days if I had training that evening. 

**Advice for others:**

1. These programs are designed to build your work capacity, the first wave is daily rough because you are getting used to doing giant sets with very little rest in between, by the end you hardly even notice this. I don’t see how I would go back to another style of training, to be honest.
2. Regularly the assistance finishers that Brian programs are the hardest part of the workout, there is nothing like finishing your squat strength and volume giant sets only to have an assistance finisher of squats for 3, 2, 1 minute on/off with no re-rack to build mental toughness. 
3. There are no Deloads planned but don’t be afraid to take one, I had to take 2, one because of a death in the family and another due to being fried, it helped me massively when I did.
4. As much as you possibly can try to keep 2 days between workouts, I had to do one week with workouts back to back and I was absolutely fried by the end of it and my Bench testing decreased significantly from the previous wave.  
5. If you play a sport I would run this in the off-season, the 1.5 waves I had while playing rugby were very hard, between 4 gym sessions 2 pitch sessions and a match at the weekend I did not get much recovery in, I am sure my lifts would have improved slightly more if I had of exclusively run this program in the offseason. Alas, Covid doesn’t care about any of that.

**What next?**

Well, we have gone back into Lockdown for 6 weeks here in Ireland, so it’s back to 10kg dumbbells, pull-ups, push-ups and Olympic rings. Might try and drop another couple of Kg as well. It’s going to be fairly grim at this time of the year that’s for sure. Gyms should be open again at the start of December, and hopefully, Rugby can start again in the new year. I’m kind of at a loss what program to run once the gyms open back up. I was thinning A2S but there is a lot of volume, so I am undecided. I might just modify this program and run a 3-day version. But If anyone has any advice please let me know. Without a doubt, I will be running this program again next offseason.

ebi50z,weightroom,[Program Review] Matt Vincent - Destroyer,"I haven't seen anyone else running this program, so I'd like to submit this review for anyone thinking about it.  


**Brief Summary**  

This program was reasonably good. It got me stronger, somewhat more explosive, and worked towards my general goals. However, it has some weak points and sections I would change were I to run it again. I would recommend this program to someone who wants an interesting change of pace, a good general-purpose program, and to gain some size. I would not recommend it to someone seeking maximal strength gains.  


**Preliminary Details & Statistics**  

*Background:*   
Mostly private, so we won't go into that. My past is littered with various sports and I worked a very physically-demanding career for a time. It also contains quite a collection of injuries - most recent serious recovery was from a car crash in 2017 that did a fair bit of damage that is still fading. I'm still trying to pull my gym lifts back.  


*Lifts:*  

Starting 1RMs were estimated/guessed at, for various reasons. Weights are in lbs.  
 
- Front Squat: 295 belted -> 295 beltless. Suspect 315 is doable belted, if not more.  
- Bench: 295 -> 315. I hadn't benched for a year prior to this program, and this was a fairly safe 1RM. I didn't push harder due to no spotter.  
- Deadlift: 535 belted -> 535 beltless. Not entirely certain my deadlift improved on this program. The increase was not as solid as front squat.  
- Push Press: 245 -> 255, both beltless. Like bench, hadn't push pressed for a while before this program. Definitely felt more fluid afterwards - more leg drive, less brute press. Possibly could do more.  
- Snatch & Clean: ?? to heavier ??. Definitely stronger, but haven't tested properly. Mostly saw the same weights moving more cleanly. Kinda got bored of it to be honest.  

I can also lift a passed-out, 250ish lb man from the floor and put him over my shoulder without help. Not really relevant, but somewhat funny and I'm going to pretend it's for context.  


*Weight & Diet*  

- Weight before: Fatter than I'd like.  

- Weight after: Noticeably less fat.  

I ran this program on a cut - I decided that this program would keep it interesting during my cut, because I'd be doing a bunch of stuff I don't usually do, so a little drop in performance would be expected anyway. Felt like it'd be a more positive experience than trying to grind out with something like 5/3/1, or conditioning myself to death on an Alsruhe program.  

I ended up on an intermittent fasting approach. Variable timeframe, but always fasting at least 16 hours, usually 18+. I would train in the morning (6ish) and not eat until after midday. No supplements, because I couldn't be bothered.  


**The Program**  

Unfortunately for this review, Destroyer is a paid program. As such, I don't feel right giving out too much detail about accessory work. For those of you interested in the structure, I recommend watching the creator's video about the program [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSxaNoLF-rA&t=1s). I will assume anyone reading this has watched this video, and so discuss things that are mentioned therein.  

Destroyer is a 12-week program consisting of three phases:  

- A three-week hypertrophy block, training 4 days a week (S/B/D/Pp) with a 10x10 rep scheme for the main movement. Conditioning twice a week.  
 
- A five-week speed & power block, training 3 days a week (S,B/D,Pp/Sn,Cl), with various rep & set ranges. Conditioning every day.  

- A four-week max strength block, with the same layout as speed & power, 5x5 scheme.  Conditioning twice a week.  

All the assistance work is programmed in, and I ran it almost exactly as written, without changing or adding exercises. The only things I changed were front squatting instead of back, because I hate back squatting, and adductor/abductor work because it seems to help my knees recover from 10x10 front squats.  

As I can't really go into the assistance work much, I will instead simply discuss positives and negatives from this program.  


*Positives*  

- Destroyer provided new stimuli, which was interesting. In particular, the assistance work was often a lot higher rep than I would typically do (up to 25 reps). There were also some movements I hadn't tried before (for instance, some of the assistance work for snatches and cleans was new). This kick-started some hypertrophy that I hadn't had before, which was nice.  
- On the hypertrophy note, the high-rep work and the size phase definitely worked. My upper back and my legs saw the biggest increase. I can only assume that with a proper diet, geared towards gaining muscle rather than dropping fat, the results would have been remarkable.  
- This program was eminently runnable on a cut. I'm not sure if many will see that as a positive, but for me it was nice to have a program that I could get some use out of while trying to lean down.  
- The inclusion of snatches, cleans and push press gave me a better ability to chain bits of my body together. High rep push press especially made me far more aware of driving from the bottom up.  
- The speed and power was pretty good. For my upper-body lifts, it made a noticeable difference.  
- I did get a bit stronger.  


*Negatives*  

- This program really isn't aimed at packing on a lot of max strength. I'm pretty convinced that even if I'd been eating like a horse I wouldn't have seen much more improvement on the top end. The simple fact is that for about half the program, you're not handling weights above 70%. Even when you do start getting heavier, it's only for one or two reps at a time. It's not until you get to the last phase that you really start pushing decent weight for decent reps. Some may like this, but I felt that I just didn't have enough time under the bar with heavy weight to gear me up for serious lifting.  
- Tying in with the above, there's a lack of heavy assistance work. It's almost entirely above 10 reps - ALL of it. A lot of it is up around 25, which limits the amount of weight you can throw on. Personally, I felt like I needed some solid, heavy secondary movements around the 8-12 rep range. I also DESPERATELY needed more heavy work for my back - 25 rep rows don't do much for me for strength.  
- No ab work. You could definitely add, but as I said I ran this as written. I really felt the lack of ab work, especially in my squat and dead.  
- The assistance work is fixed, and that's fine...but if it's not something that hits your weak spots, it doesn't do much good. The work for deadlifts just didn't hit my weak points at all, and it felt like a lot of wasted time.  
- The max strength phase just feels awkward. After not having handled anything heavy for decent reps for the last 8 weeks, it's a bit of a big change-up. I'd far rather have this phase have you work up to a new rep max each time - say an 8rm, then a 5, 3, 1. Something like that. I feel like that'd get you back into the mentality of pushing your boundaries a bit better, and get you set up for setting a new PR.  
- No targeted rear delt work. The pulling helps, but I feel a lot more comfortable when I'm doing pull-aparts, face pulls or similar.  


*What Would I Change?*  
- I think first, I'd bump the percentages in the size block up by about 10%. I think it'd still be doable, but you'd get more experience with harder weights that would stand you in good stead later. I think I'd change the max strength block up as I mentioned above, to set new rep maxes. The speed and power could probably stay as-is.  
- The assistance work would need personalising. I'd lower the rep range on some stuff and bump up the weight, change a few exercises around to hit my own weak points.  
  

**Conclusion**  

This program wasn't terrible. As can be seen, I did make some strength gains, I lost weight, and I got some nice general improvements. It's all about what you want to get out of this. If you want to really get strong? Not for you. You want to get really conditioned? Also probably not. You want to try out new stuff and get generally better at a range of stuff? Might be worth a try.  

It's definitely not a bad program by any stretch, more that certain aspects didn't work for me personally. My upper-body lifts definitely increased, but because those also happened to be lifts I hadn't trained for a while, but *bad* worked the muscles involved, I don't know how much of the increase is due to this program.  


*Who Should Run This Program?*  
People who have a bunch of stuff going on. If you're a powerlifter or strongman, you don't need me to tell you that there's specific programs that are better for you. If, however, you play a bit of casual sport, you do a bit of martial arts, you just want to be decently strong, decently fast, decently everything...this might be one for you to try. 


*Would I Run This Again?*  
Tough one. On balance, I'd say...maybe. Maybe, but I'd edit the hell out of it to actually hit my weak points and give me what I want. It'll be quite a while before I consider it, certainly - it just didn't add the strength that I wanted.   


*What Will I Run Next?*  
In the new year, I will be running Brian Alsruhe's 4Horsemen program. The core will definitely stay the same, but I think the assistance work will be kept a bit more consistent just so I have a solid routine and can make the most of my time in the gym.",2019-12-16 17:26:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/ebi50z/program_review_matt_vincent_destroyer/

[Bench](https://youtu.be/NnfiLg66Fl0) (I just realized that my hoodie obscures my butt and the angle obscures my chest, so you’ll just have to trust me that I didn’t lift off the bench and I touched).  Fun fact, my spotter is the same age as me, a few pounds lighter, and has a 1200-1250 total in competition, definitely a big inspiration for me.


[Deadlift](https://youtu.be/FbZ12IJRpvI?t=18s)


I think my squat might not have passed in competition, I’m not sure if the bar dips down or not.  I don’t think I paused long enough on the bench, but I think I could’ve gotten it with a longer pause.  With the deadlift, I do lock out at the top but I lose my balance.  Probably wouldn’t have counted in competition, but for a gym PR, I’m ok with it.

Any form advice would be greatly appreciated!


#History


My first serious experience with sports was in Freshman and Sophomore year of High School.  I joined the swim team and trained for a total of ~16 months.  I was never an exceptional swimmer, but I wasn’t bad – my 50m Freestyle time was 31s.  I think swimming built a base for my body, giving me some muscle, conditioning, and significantly improved my proprioception.


I tried to lift somewhat sporadically.  However, all my gym had was a smith machine.  I managed to learn some squat form, but nothing for bench and deadlift.  Also, swim practice took up so much energy that I couldn’t stick to lifting.


Because my family moved after Sophomore year, I quit the swim team.  After about a year of no athletics, I felt fat and weak (that year I gained 30 lbs of mostly fat, bringing me from 147 lbs to 177 lbs), so I wanted to lift more seriously.  Two months before the summer of 2017, I went into the gym with no real program.  I did a weird 3x5 for squat and bench plus ohp, machine rows, curls, and overhead tricep extensions, progressing weight linearly.  My squat is the only lift that made any real progress during this period.  Also, I didn’t actually deadlift at all – my flexibility didn’t let me get into a good position and I never put enough weight on the bar to learn proper form.  I was so scared of rounding my back that I didn’t go anywhere.  However, at the start of summer, my friend prompted me to deadlift and I managed to pick up 225.


In Junior year, I had to drop lifting (again) because of college applications.  Starting in November, I used stress from the college process to help me cut weight, from Nov-Dec I lost 7 pounds, moving from 177lbs to 170lbs.  I think this was mostly fat.


Having finished college applications, I resolved to go back to the gym.  By this point, I had been reading some StrongerByScience articles, so I decided to give Greg Nuckol’s 28 programs a shot.  I continued for 7 weeks, going down to 163lbs.  Then, I started to bulk and deloaded for a week.  I remained on the program for 2 more weeks afterwards, and noticing that my lifts were stalling even though my recovery and fatigue were in check, decided to test my maxes then move onto another program.


That brings us to this week!  I took a really quick deload on Monday, and tested s/b/d today.  I’m super happy about my 3 plate squat.  I thought it would take me at least 3-4 months, and it took me 2.5 months on a (mostly) cut!


#Program Overview


Greg Nuckol’s 28 Programs are a free collection of a-la-carte squat, bench, and deadlift programs.  There are beginner, intermediate, or advanced programs for each lift.  Furthermore, each difficulty has a 1x, 2x, and 3x per week version.  The programs come with a pdf partner, which gives examples about certain program combinations.  Using this partner, I decided on the 3x bench beginner, 3x squat beginner, and 2x deadlift beginner programs.


The program itself uses DUP (daily undulating periodization).  Week-to-week progress is determined by a daily AMRAP set.  The 3x squat and 3x bench beginner programs are actually the exact same.  The deadlift program is different, does not use AMRAPs, and tests a 1RM max every 4-week cycle.


Mondays for squat/bench are 2x8@70%, then AMRAP.  If you get 8 or less reps, weight stays the same for Mondays.  9-10 reps, increase weight by 5 lbs.  11-12 reps, increase weight by 10 lbs.  12+, increase weight by 15lbs


Wednesdays are 2x6@75%, then AMRAP.  Similar AMRAP progression to above, but it starts at 6 reps.
Fridays are 2x4@80%, then AMRAP.  Again, like above, but starting at 4 reps.


Deadlift is hard for me to explain.  Mondays increase linearly (5-10lbs/week), whereas Fridays start with the week 1 Monday weight and add 5-10lbs per set if the previous set was RPE 8 or below.  Mondays use your primary stance, Fridays use your secondary stance.  Every week has more volume than the last, up to the Monday of the 4th week which is a deload, and the 1RM test on Friday.  I believe Greg Nuckols recommends beginners swap primary and secondary stances each cycle.


Accessories are at the lifter’s discretion.


#Nutrition


My diet as a swimmer basically involved eating everything in sight.  If I had to estimate, I think I hit 4000 calories pretty easily.


While on the program January 2018, I ate ~1500 cal/day, eating 200 calories more if I had exercised that day.  During the cut, I don’t think I ate enough protein.  I ate around .6g/lb of bodyweight.  I followed an intermittent fasting protocol.  Normally, I fasted 16 hours, ate a 200-300 calorie lunch (1% milk + chicken breast), then ate a big dinner.  Some weeks, I only ate dinner (fasting for 23 hours?).  


At the beginning of my diet in November 2017, I intended to cut until ~155 lbs, but recognizing my levels of fatigue and weight loss plateau, having cut for ~3 months, I decided to bulk.


Starting my deload at the end of February, I began to eat ~2500 cal/day (likely more, I stopped tracking).  I began to drink protein shakes, each shake containing 60-90g of protein.  I hit 1g protein/lb of bodyweight pretty comfortably.


Right now, I continue to eat 2500cal/day.


#Supplements


I took 10g creatine/day on accident during Jan/Feb, thinking the scoop was 2.5g.  I take 5g/day now.



45 minutes before I work out, I take 6g citrulline malate.  Some days I drank a cup of iced coffee (caffeine content unknown, but it was black).  On the day I tested maxes, I drank 2-3 cups iced coffee 45 minutes before my 1RM max squat.


Since my deload week, I’ve normally consumed 60g of protein powder in a shake, sometimes with a few cups of milk (+16g protein).  Recently, I’ve been mixing orange Gatorade powder in, which has contributed to my carb intake.


#Recovery


My workout sessions last between 1h45m and 2h15m because I rest a lot between sets (3 mins normally).  I don’t mind because the gym is a relaxing place for me.


I sleep a lot.  I go to sleep around 9-9:30PM and wake up around 6:00.  Every Friday, and every other Monday, however, I wake up at 5AM and start lifting at 5:30AM since I can’t go to the gym after school.


I walk 1.5 miles from school to gym, then another 1.5 miles from gym to home at a very leisurely pace.  I think this has helped me with my DOMS.


For my deload week, I cut volume by 50%, replaced the AMRAP with a regular set, and dropped intensity by 5-10%.  I did the same for my accessories.


#Modifications


On the second cycle of deadlifting, I actually cut out the 4th week (maxing week).  That 8th week ended up being my deload week.  After my deload, I restarted from week 1 with heavier weight.  Per Greg Nuckols recommendation, I swapped my primary and secondary stances on the second cycle.  For the first cycle, I did sumo as my primary and conventional as my secondary.  For the second, I did the opposite.


In terms of accessories, I normally do 2-3 accessories after each workout, with low intensity and high reps.  Monday is normally incline bench, flyes, and face pulls.  Wednesday is Pendlay Rows and machine (cable?) lat pulldowns.  Friday is curls and overhead tricep extensions.  I did some pull ups sporadically, but I hate them so I ended up cutting them out.  I tried to add OHP but it was too much fatigue on a cut.


Accessories were chosen based on my aesthetic desires (arm stuff), to improve my main lifts (dumbbell bench and flyes have stopped most of the shaking that I used to have on bench), and perceived weaknesses (back).


While not strictly a modification, I did some basic stretching at night.  I’ve gotten significant improvements in my mobility, notably in my lumbar region and hip flexors.  Swimming made my shoulders pretty mobile, but that’s improved a little as well.


#Thoughts


I really, really liked this program.  I didn’t think I would make this much progress on a cut, and although I was (and still am) a beginner, I don’t think my progress can be entirely chalked up to newbie gains.  I believe the program helped me much more than a basic linear progression program would.


The AMRAP sets taught me a lot about judging RPE and learning where my body would fail.  I think, especially on squats, learning to lift at near-failure significantly improved my technique.  I used to have issues with my feet tilting outwards mid-squat, knee valgus, and some hip shift.  I think those problems are all gone now.  I still have issues with my squat bar path jerking forward on near maximal effort lifts, which I’m going to address in the future.


Testing an AMRAP every day kept me nervous and excited.  It was really cool to see my Friday heavy weight become my Wednesday medium weight, which then became my low-intensity Monday weight.  I learned to accept good days and really bad days and judge my overall fatigue more accurately.  
I also learned that I can’t grind nearly as hard on my bench, which dies pitifully if it stalls halfway up.  I think this means weak anterior delts.


Working at a variety of intensities and rep ranges kept things fresh and gave me good practice.


#Future


Like I mentioned earlier, I decided to test maxes because I could tell progress was stalling even though my fatigue and recovery were in check.  I wanted to get some numbers to plug into another program with more volume to progress further.


Although I’m certain that the intermediate programs are also awesome, I want to explore other programs.  I got the Sheiko app and I’m planning on doing Intermediate Medium load for 3 months.  I think the high volume and low intensity in the first block will help me iron out my form.  Plus, I figure if I’m spending 2 hours in the gym anyways, I might as well do Sheiko.


I’m going to continue my bulk for these 3 months and re-evaluate after the three months.
On an unrelated note, I’m really grateful to this sub for opening my eyes to fantastic lifters and great educational content.  I couldn’t have gotten here without r/weightroom.


**If you’ve read this entire thing, I really appreciate it and I’m super impressed.  Your attention span is significantly longer than mine (as I write this, I have exams tomorrow that I should be studying for).**

82l1b4,weightroom,"[Meet Report] Northeastern States Open, Connecticut (190kg total @ 75.3kg bw | 240 Sinclair, 22yo, Sr)","### Background and Training

Hey guys. I've been training weightlifting for a couple years now, with a focus on powerlifting for a few years before that. As far as training goes, from about September to the end of December I was being coached once a week in person, with weekly programming. Although it was a really great facility with very qualified coaches, it was far away, and I could only make it in on Saturdays. While I do think I saw a lot of progress from this, it eventually stopped being worth it and I stuck to training independently.

8 weeks out from this competition I started the Speed & Strength cycle offered by Catalyst to build some accumulation and taper for the meet. The first half of the program utilizes complexes and strength work, while the second half is more focused on developing speed and comfort with maximal and sub-maximal loads.

### Meet Prep

This was my third competition, so I was more concerned with trying to do well then going 6 for 6 or doing it for the experience. Originally an 85, I dropped to 77 for these last 2 meets. I felt like I didn't have nearly enough muscle mass to justify staying at 85. I actually have a spreadsheet/chart of my weight loss [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I1vosOtaRW4-xMyzxxGzeXpJ4e_nuagDgpEho7J01XY/edit?usp=sharing) for anyone interested.

As far as weight cutting methods, I started off with intermittent fasting in the beginning to get a sizable initial cut in while the programming was relatively easy. From then on I roughly followed a Renaissance Periodization template, which was mostly focused on timing moderately sized meals, with a pretty carb heavy meal a few hours before training. I definitely felt more full and satisfied throughout the day following this template, and continued to lose weight, so I definitely prefer it over IF. But I didn't really feel any performance issues following IF, so it's an option I'd probably explore again.

### The Lifts

My attempts can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf92CXon7YV/).

### Snatch

* 78 kg, make
* 81 kg, make
* 85 kg, make

### Clean & Jerk

* 98 kg, make
* 101 kg, make
* 105 kg, make

### Results

Ended up placing first in my weight class with a 190kg total-- I think 5kg above the next guy. I also PR'd both my comp snatch and C&J by 10kg each, so I was pretty happy. I've hit close to both those numbers in training, but obviously the setting of a meet can be really different. I was also struggling to hit heavy singles close to these in the weeks leading up to the comp, so I was pretty surprised and happy to hit them on meet day. 

### Final Thoughts

All in all, pretty darn happy with my results. At this stage in my ""career"", I don't think it's too crazy to keep putting 5-10kg on my lifts/total from meet to meet, so that'll be a goal of mine going forward. 

I also think I'm gonna try and put on some weight before I compete next. Being ~5'10"" isn't necessarily ideal for a 77, so I'm planning on either moving back up to 85 or putting on some good weight and cutting hard back to 77.

For training, I think next I'll follow the program Torokhtiy wrote for ATG, as a lot of redditors commented that the volume at relatively moderate intensities worked wonders for their technique, and I think that's what I need most right now. 

If anyone has any questions, or also any programming suggestions and form critiques, please lay em on me. ",2018-03-07 03:00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/82l1b4/meet_report_northeastern_states_open_connecticut/

for those who did not watch, the presenter advocated these points:

* nutrient timing has a minor impact on changing the body composition, but is more important for those who are cutting
* you need a steady influx of protein for optimal growth, therefore eating a protein rich meal every 3 to 5 hours is optimal.

* avoid fatty meals around the exercise period since they slow absorption, and focus on carbs to refeul CNS and refill the glycogen stores.

* so pre-workout, a carb-protein mix with no fat is ideal. and post workout, a low fat meal is ideal.

what this hints at is that intermittent fasting does not work, and he mentions it in the video.

More pics are on my post at [my blog] (http://www.counting-to-infinity.com) for those who want to see more of me with my shirt off…

**Intro:** Hot on the heels of my last review, I thought I would go ahead a review this program, since I’ve now run it for two mesocycles. For those of you who haven’t heard of it, Boss Barbell Strength method (hereafter referred to as BBSM) is [Dan Green’s] (https://www.facebook.com/DanGreenRawPowerlifter) own program. I started lifting at Dan’s gym, [Boss Barbell Club (BBBC)] (https://www.facebook.com/bossbarbellclub) last year as I was running through the last few months of DoggCrapp. When I finally gave up on DC training, Dan suggested I give his system a try, and was kind enough to lay out the template for me, so I did.  
What follows is a review of it from my understanding of it, which is not quite complete. Most of what I know of the program has been from a few hours’ worth of Q&A here and there with Dan, along with my initial template setup from him. In other words, the layout I describe should be pretty accurate, but the reasoning for why he chose specific movements and so on may be flawed, since I don’t profess to completely understand all of the subtlety in it yet. If you want the info straight from the horse’s mouth, hit Dan up on Facebook, or check out his thread on [Animal’s forums] (http://forum.animalpak.com/showthread.php?39933-Questions-Answers-Partying-with-BOSS-Dan-Green) (which I suggest reading through anyway…it will be the best few hours you are likely to spend).

**Rep and Set Scheme:** The basic layout of the program is five or six days a week (I did five). Normally, it’s split up with lifting on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, but I did it M-F (I did Sunday’s lifts on Thursday), which Dan said was fine. Before I go through the split, I need to kind of describe the layout of each day, as that will make the split make more sense. Essentially, each day you have a main movement, some secondary movements, and some accessory movements. The main movement is a powerlift or a really close variant, the secondary movements are usually heavy compound movements that are related to the main movement, and the accessory movements are usually more isolation or bodybuilding style movements just meant to add some volume. Since Dan is a powerlifter, the goal is to get stronger, but there’s a lot of volume for muscle growth as well.

So, with that in mind, my split was as follows:

**Day**|**Main Movement**|**Secondary Movement**|**Accessories**
-|-|-|-
Monday|High-Bar Squat|Paused High-Bar Squat, Romanian Deadlift|Pull-Ups, Curl variant
Tuesday|Paused Buffalo Bar Bench /Paused Wide-Grip Buffalo Bar Bench|Close-Grip Bench/Paused Close-Grip Bench, Seated DB Press/Military Press|DB Flyes, Skull-crushers, Triceps Pushdowns
Wednesday|Front Squat|None|Row variant, Farmer’s Walks, GHR situps, Seated Side Lateral Raise, Shrugs
Thursday (Sunday)| Paused Bench|Speed Bench, Paused Wide-Grip Bench, DB Incline Bench|T-Bar Row, Seated Side Lateral Raise, Dips
Friday|Deadlift (conventional)| Deficit Deadlift, Stiff-Legged Deadlift|Chins, Kroc Rows

**Note:** Dan’s a big fan of DB presses, and you are supposed to work in DB presses and Military presses on your chest days, but due to an injury, I had to drop them in my second cycle.

If you want to see how it’s structured, probably the best way to do so is to check out [my log on WeightXReps](http://weightxreps.net/journal/NetworkingGuru/), but here’s the basics:  
Everything is structured in A/B weeks. On the A week, you will generally do 3x5 on your main movement, and often 3x5 on the secondary movements as well. On the B weeks, you will generally do 2x6 on the main movement with the same weight as the A week. Secondary movements often stay the same sets/reps as the A week. When you move to the next A week, you increase the weight by 2-3% and hit 3x5. This cycle continues until you are either ready to peak (3-4 weeks out of a competition), or can’t complete all the reps with a new weight.  

If you are peaking, Dan has a whole different approach for the 2-3 weeks leading up to a meet, which I’m not going to delve into, but basically involves dropping the sets and reps while really cranking up the intensity (and usually setting some 2-3RM PR’s in every lift). Otherwise, you drop the reps by 1 per set (i.e. 3x4 instead of 3x5) and keep moving forward. When that gets to be too much you do it one more time (dropping to 3x3), and run that out. Once that is finished, you begin a new cycle, starting a bit under your last best 3x5.  

Dan suggests hitting a 1RM test somewhere in each cycle to prepare you to move more weight, regardless of which way you go.  

On the lifts themselves, the main and secondary movements don’t change much, though a few (such as the Paused Buffalo Bar Bench and Paused Wide-Grip Buffalo Bar Bench for me) will swap out on A/B weeks. Also, some of the movements (main and otherwise) use higher rep ranges (8 reps is common on Buffalo Bar work, for instance).  

The accessory movements are a different animal, as they don’t progress at a linear pace like the rest of the lifts. The goal for the accessory work is just to get volume in, so while you are always trying to improve, you aren’t always adding weight. Often, something like a 4x12 range is listed, and the goal is to hit 4x12, of course, but that doesn’t happen the first week with a weight, usually. So the first week might be 12,10,10,8, and then the second week 12,12,10,8 and so forth until you can get all 4 sets of 12. When that happens, you increment the weight by 2-3% (or the smallest possible increment, in the case of DB’s).  

Also, Dan likes to change the accessories as much as possible. To paraphrase him, one type of row is as good as any other, more or less. He likes to keep them changing to keep things fresh, but I haven’t seen him write a ton of different variations. He seems to like a handful of variants and just rotates them.  

Hopefully that gives you an idea of how it’s structured, but the big thing to take away is it’s a high-volume, high frequency, mid-to-high intensity routine with a lot of different exercises. I found the volume to be brutal, but survivable on a cut. Time-wise, if I rush I can get in and out in an hour, but most days I spend an hour and a half in the gym taking ~5 minute breaks between work sets.  

**Diet:** On diet, Dan doesn’t prescribe anything specifically, though he does say he usually has people lose weight while eating more when first starting. I started around 20% bodyfat, so I had no choice; I had to cut.  

For cutting this time, I finally found a method which was pain-free, at least until I got to ~14% BF. Basically, I used Intermittent Fasting, fasting from 8 PM to 11 AM, and training fasted (at around 8 AM). At 11, every day I ate 2 cooked pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, [prepared as always with McCormick’s Grill Mates] (http://counting-to-infinity.com/2012/04/what-an-intermittent-fasting-diet-looks-like-a-visual-guide/). On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I added to this 1 cup of cooked basmati rice. At ~3PM, I then ate 2-3 large apples. At ~5PM, I ate 2.5 oz. of Cabot Light Sharp Cheddar Cheese (which is excellent, BTW) and 5 oz. of baby spinach (raw). Finally, when I got home at ~7:45 PM, I ate two cans of [Pure Alaskan Salmon Fillets](http://counting-to-infinity.com/2013/09/pure-alaska-salmon-review/).  

This generally kept me at ~500 cal/day deficit through the week. On the weekend, I ate the same chicken for lunch, but skipped dinner and instead made homemade, unbuttered popcorn with light oil. 24 cups of this is about 800 calories, and completely fills me up. My calorie total on the weekends thereby stayed at about a 700 calorie deficit.  

Occasionally I would need a cheat meal, with these getting more and more common the leaner I got, but mostly, I could go at least a month without one until I hit 14% or so in bodyfat.

**Supps:** Liquid vitamin D (4000IU a day), creatine (~5g a day), and a multivitamin.

**Review** The best thing I can say is it exceeded my expectations. Coming off of DC training, I was very depressed at my state, and this turned things around considerably, though not without a lot of pain. In that regard, the worst thing that happened was I reinjured my AC Joint by using too much of a ROM on DB movements towards the start of my second cycle. Because of this, I had to work around the injury, which involved pulling almost all DB movements and eventually even front squats. Still, my results were pretty decent.   
Keep in mind that I had never done belted high-bar squats before or paused benches when looking at before and after numbers. Also, these are not really RM’s, these are my work weights, but the first week felt just as brutal as this week, so I should have gained a similar amount on my actual RM’s.   

The bottom line is, in four months, while cutting about a pound of fat a week, I increased my work weights by 35-75 pounds in each lift, and actually gained 7.2 pounds of muscle (almost a half a pound per week). So the objective results are pretty stellar, and *greatly* exceeded my expectations. Dan *did* tell me that most guys on his program drop fat and gain muscle while eating at a surplus, but I really didn’t believe him; I was pretty disillusioned with 2+ years of difficulty since my injury, not to mention a very depressing trial of Doggcrapp. However, this has definitely made a believer out of me.   

Now, for a subjective review, the things that stood out the most to me as ‘blowing up’ on this program were my delts, lats, and quads, in that order. I noticed more striations and a lot more ‘thickness’, overall, in my delts as the program progressed. My lats kept getting bulkier and bulkier, which is a trend that I expect (and hope) to continue, considering that the program has you doing some kind of heavy pull (and often multiple heavy pulls) three days a week. Finally, my quads kept getting more defined, and despite dropping weight, never dropped in size.  

However, subjective impressions can be misleading, and since DEXA also separates mass differences based on body part and side, I actually have data to analyze.   

It turns out that my initial impression of where it impacted me most was correct, and I gained a whopping 5.9 lbs. of lean mass in my torso. However, the next biggest gains were not on my legs…they were on my arms. I put 1.8 pounds of lean mass on my arms, which is a 7% increase in lean mass. My legs, on the other hand, actually lost muscle to the tune of 1/2 pound of muscle lost (overall not worth worrying about, but interesting).   
Also, while I feel this program did help even out my mismatched right and left arms, they are still pretty horribly out of whack. My left arm currently has 2 pounds less lean mass than my right arm, a difference of 14%. For reference, my right and left legs only differ by 6% (and my left is bigger).   

Still, at the end of two cycles, I have set two major aesthetic PR’s: The leanest I’ve ever been at, and the most muscle mass I’ve ever had at *any* weight. Setting both of those at the same time is more than I ever hoped for. 
All that said, there are a few things I think need to be said that make it, as written, not a great program for some goals.  

First, it is very difficult, and doesn’t really have a ‘deload’. You kind of taper down towards the end of a cycle and then start back slightly lower than you left off, but it’s not like you get an in-built 2-4 week grace period between cycles. This is especially rough when you are starving yourself (as Dan puts it), and I actually had to ‘nope’ out for a week between my two cycles. I could not get all of my squat reps on the first day of the new cycle, so rest seemed to be the best medicine.  

Second, it’s a strength program at its core, and while it does include some BB work to put size on you, it’s not about balancing your physique for aesthetics. For example, while there is a LOT of volume devoted towards triceps, there’s comparatively very little for the biceps, and literally none for the calves. Since my biceps and calves are my two weakest areas, I’ve already started adding in supersets of calf raises in between bench sets, and various curls supersetted whenever I am doing something that isn’t using my biceps. You may need to do similar things to hit your weak spots.  

Third, at least until Dan comes out with a book or guide on his method, this is probably not something you should try to run without some more info from him (especially not just using this post as a guide!) The program seems to have a lot of things on the accessory side that are based on experience where Dan seems to choose lifts to correct deficiencies. I don’t really have a good handle on it myself after four months, so there’s pretty much no way you can get the required wisdom out of this post.   

Overall, the only program that has worked better for me than BBSM is Madcow, and Madcow stopped working for me quite some time ago. BBSM has so far put more muscle on me than I actually thought possible in 4 months, all while dieting down. I would wholeheartedly recommend that anyone in the area contact Dan and try to get on his program. For those outside of the bay area, hit up his FB page. I don’t think he’s taking online clients right now, but maybe if everyone shows interest he will put a guide together.

2adukx,weightroom,Program Review - One year on DoggCrapp Training,"**TL:DR** – Ran DCT for a full year, through multiple dietary regimes and got DEXA scans throughout – Lost some muscle, got fat, and wasted a year. Would not do it again, and would not recommend anyone ever do this program.

**My Stats:** Male, 38, 5’8”, 2 Years on Madcow 5x5, followed by 1 Year of injury recovery (spinal surgery)

Starting Stats (DEXA scan verified):  
Body Weight: 225.4 lbs.  
Lean Mass: 192.2 lbs.  
Fat Mass: 33.2 lbs.  
14.73% bodyfat  
Squat (low bar, no belt): 380x3  
Deadlift (no belt): 405x5  
Bench (TNG): 240x3  

Ending Stats (DEXA scan verified):  
Body Weight: 240.6 lbs.  
Lean Mass: 190.3 lbs.  
Fat Mass: 50.3 lbs.  
20.91% bodyfat  
Squat (low bar, no belt): 390x5  
Deadlift (no belt): 445x5  
Bench (TNG): 245x4  

**Goals:** I was coming back from an injury, and I decided that honestly, my biggest goal is not to get as strong as possible (at 39, I’m not going to set any records), but to put on as much lean mass as possible. I read up on DC, and while it sounded like a whole bunch of curl-bro non-sense, it has a large following and Dante (the inventor of the program) is HUH-YUGE. I figured I shouldn’t knock it until I tried it, so I endeavored to give it a full on try.

**Rep and Set Scheme:** The basic layout of DC training that I used is a three day a week schedule where you hit specific body parts each day. For me, Monday was shoulders, triceps, and deadlifts, Wednesday was quads, hams, calves, and biceps, and Friday was chest and back.  
In this schedule, you pick a single (preferably compound) exercise for each body part, and with the exception of squats and deads, perform three rest-pause sets with your work weight. For those of you unfamiliar with rest-pause training, the idea is that you knock out a single set to failure with your work weight, then rest 15-30 seconds, knock out a second set to failure, rest 15-30 seconds, and complete one last set to failure. Typically, you get ½ of the previous sets reps in each set after the first, so if you got 12 reps in the first set, you normally get 6 in the second and 3 in the third. The general idea is that muscular fatigue, indicated through failure, is the primary mechanism by which hypertrophy is impacted, so it makes sense to chase that as much as possible. By using rest-pause, you can do this very efficiently, time-wise, in opposition to the normal bodybuilder-style high volume approach that takes 2+ hours a day.  
Progression occurs weekly, in a more or less linear fashion. You go in each day and try to get more reps than you did last week. Once you hit a prescribed number of total reps across all three sets, you increase the weight. If you can’t increase the weight or reps from last week,  you get once more try the next week. If you still can’t progress, then you swap that exercise out the next time you work that bodypart. So, if you were doing Pendlay rows and unable to progress, you might swap them out for standard barbell rows, t-bar rows, or even cable rows.  
If anyone wants to review my actual workouts, you can see them on [The Squat Rack]( https://thesquatrack.com/profile/NetworkingGuru) or [Fitocracy]( https://www.fitocracy.com/profile/NetworkingGuru/?feed). I ran the program from January of 2013 through January of this year. 

**Diet:** Diet-wise, Dante has a lot of rules. No calorie counting, no carbs after 6PM, lots of protein all the time, eat when you are hungry, etc. This is where my multiple runs come in, as I kept modifying my diet to try and make this work.  
At first, I stuck with my typical leangains dieting, which I posted about here, but basically revolves around eating at a caloric surplus on lifting days and a caloric deficit on off days, with lots of protein on all days. Next, I tried a binge-purge kind of extreme intermittent fasting whereby I ate at maintenance on lifting days, ate nothing (literally nothing, 24-36 hour fasts) on non-lifting days, and binged (7,000 - 13,000 calories per day) on the weekends. Finally, I followed Dante’s recommendations to the T. No carbs after 6, eating when hungry, not counting calories (but still tracking, just not limiting), and so forth, including upping my protein intake to over half a KG per day (500-600 grams).  
If anyone wants to examine my diet, it was all recorded at [Dailyburn]( http://tracker.dailyburn.com/nutrition?user=225034).

**Supps:** I made a number of changes throughout, but I ended up settling on BCAA’s and creatine during the workout, Vitamin D (4000 IU), Fish Oil, and a Multivitamin.

**Review** Overall, I really enjoyed it at first. Workouts were fast, and I kind of enjoy going to failure, so the idea of an efficient system based around going to failure really appealed to me. I also got stronger, though not significantly. However, as time went on, I began to get more and more burnt out. By the end of the year, I was completely fried, and making myself go into the gym each day was murder, even when on a serious caloric surplus.  
Ultimately, I came away with the conclusion that going to failure while forcing yourself to improve every week is draining from an emotional perspective, which for me, was much more debilitating than if it had been physically taxing. On the physical side, however, I didn’t really have any problems, probably because the volume wasn’t high enough to stimulate growth, much less injure me.  
My results, needless to say, were not good. Despite giving the system an entire year, despite trying every possible dietary combination, despite doing all of the ‘extreme stretching’ prescribed and the exact lifts he recommended, I not only didn’t get any bigger, I actually lost muscle while gaining fat.  
**Lessons Learned:**

* Subjective intensity is a horrible arbiter of effectiveness. At best, it doesn’t mean anything and at worst, it’s harmful. Use Prilepin’s chart instead of subjective intensity to determine if a workout is going to be useful.  
* Diet has some impact in growth, but if the program doesn’t stimulate growth, changing what you are eating isn’t going to help. 
* Volume is important and necessary for growth. 
* You can get stronger while not gaining (or even losing) muscle. 
* There’s some wacky dieting techniques involving fasting that, shockingly, actually work. Fasting for 24, 36, or even 72 hours isn’t going to kill your metabolism or even sacrifice muscle, as long as you get the right nutrients in when you do eat. 
* Your metabolism will actually adjust pretty quickly to fasting in some ways. 24 hours into a fast, I will get SUPER cold. Similarly, a few hours into a binge, I will start sweating profusely and will generally need the rooms to be cooler. This happens consistently. 
* It’s very easy to waste a bunch of time accomplishing fuck-all when you are constantly changing the exercises you use. 
* Always have a way to measure progress. If you want strength, make sure you are getting stronger. If you want muscle mass, make sure you have a way of objectively measuring mass (DEXA, Bodpod, Dunk Tank). If you aren’t making the results you want, change something. 
* Just because something works for someone else does not mean it will work for you. For that matter, who’s to say it’s working for them?

Anyhow, sorry to be a downer, but I thought I would post this up since this sub only seems to get people who are happy with a program. I figure negative reviews are at least as useful as positive. There may be a little more info on my [site](http://www.counting-to-infinity.com) for those who want more info, but I think I pasta’d it all. 

EDIT: Formatting

**EDIT2:** [Before](http://imgur.com/Cxy2sA3) and [After](http://imgur.com/LqMSvpc) pics

**EDIT3:** Since this keeps coming up, I’ll address it here. Diet is certainly the culprit for getting fat, though not for the reasons you probably think. I don’t think it had anything to do with not gaining muscle, and here’s why.
The first dietary regime I went with was a pretty standard +20/-20 IF regimen, which is the same one I did in Madcow, and which took my bench from 205x5 to 345x5, squat from 220x5 to 405x5, and dead from 200x5 to 435x5, all at 212lbs and 12% BF so it’s certainly capable of putting muscle on me.  

When that didn’t work, I decided to try some of the exotic IF regimes, since I had just read Eat Stop Eat. 

When that didn’t work, I switched to Dante’s *exact* dietary recommendations: 6-7 meals a day, 500+ g of protein, all clean foods, no carbs after 6, etc. 

The thing to point out here is my bodyfat stayed below 15% and muscle stayed relatively stable **until** I started following Dante’s recommendations. Only then did I both get fat and lose muscle, for whatever reason. It didn’t make sense to me at the time, and doesn’t now, but that’s what happened.

250euu,weightroom,"[Meet Report/GZCL Method Program Report] USPA LA Open - Westlake Village, CA - 04/26/2014 - 440kg (970lbs) @ 73.4kg (163.8lbs) - 318.34 Wilks - 31 y/o","[Warning: long - video below and bolded!]

**STATS**

* Age: 31
* Height: 5'9"" (175cm)
* Weight: 163.8 lbs. (74.3kg)

**BACKGROUND**

I began lifting in the spring/summer of 2011, while training for a half-marathon and going through general withdrawal due to a relocation for work, which caused me to leave my comfortable martial arts dojo, where I trained ~6x/wk, for a desolate landscape where nothing physically-oriented seemed to click. I started with some personal trainer sessions (never again) while trying to get my diet and nutrition in check, get somewhat strong, and lose some weight. I gained about 10 pounds since the move and was feeling pretty bad about it. I was a pretty soft 170-175 lbs at a little under 5'9"". During the PT time, I read up on Starting Strength and started doing that alongside the PT stuff while trying to abandon the PT. Obviously this wasn't sustainable, but I might as well squat to parallel on my own when the PT isn't around to tell me to do half-squats to protect my knees and have me work on the Smith machine. I finished the PT sessions in the summer/fall, did SS on a deficit and ultimately stalled well before I should have. Around New Year's 2012, I hit a 315 deadlift for a single.

I still struggled with diet (i.e. binging) and discipline into 2012, while experimenting with Madcow, Reverse Pyramid Training, and general fuckarounditis, so I never really got on an effective strength building plan. Around New Year's of 2013, I attempted a 315 deadlift again and got 5 reps. I finally reached my initial goal of leanness around my birthday in May of 2013 after maturing to a reasonable degree of discipline, and ingraining intermittent fasting into my lifestyle. My lowest weight was 150.6, on my 31st birthday, after a weekend vacation where I evidently was carb depleted. I was ~10%bf, maybe lower, but weak. I decided to slowly increase calories and finally try to get somewhat strong. Still mentally hungup on aesthetics, I did PHAT while ramping up calories throughout the summer. I didn't deadlift. I learned a heck of a lot, had some fun, but lost motivation in the fall. I wanted to focus more on strength and get back to deadlifting.

I needed something new and came across /u/gzcl's [method for powerlifting](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html). After emailing him, I started with a permutation of the Regular program on [The Squat Rack](http://thesquatrack.com/), with Training Maxes of 280/190/325. The deadlift was conservative because I hadn't trained it for so long and, when I tested it after testing my squat max, it was ~345 give or take. 

I have been using his method since the fall, mostly being in a caloric surplus, and have made great progress physically and mentally. I mostly ran the Meet Prep template from his blog post, linked above. I also started videotaping my lifts in November, which has helped immensely. I realized my squat wasn't to depth, or was *barely* to depth. I reset my Training Max because I was weaker than I thought. The first cycle was very rough, but I soon built up the T2 work capacity to really benefit from all the extra sets, instead of just trying to survive. Trying to survive has merit, but is far from sustainable. All the main lift T2 work has been incredibly helpful in building my base and confidence under the bar. 

**PSA:** video lifts early and learn what your form looks like versus what it feels like, as well as gauging bar speed versus RPE.

Based on meet reports and the community here, I decided to compete. Thanks to everyone who posted meet reports and encouraged others to compete. I wouldn't have done this without you all. 

My first meet was February 15, 2014 in Redondo Beach, CA - the USAPL CA State Championships. I didn't post a meet report partly due to being overwhelmed with work, but I might get to it to check that box off my personal list. That said, I went 9/9, with 137.5/95/182.5kg (303.1/203.9/402.3lbs), totaling 415kg @ 73.4kg (914.9lb @ 161.8lb). I had a lot of fun and now had concrete goals. 

**MEET PREP TRAINING**

I ran the GZCL meet prep cycle twice between meets. Leading up to the meet, I hit a squat of 295x5 (I was going for 3 clean reps, but felt great...I probably had an ugly 6th), 200x3 on bench (TnG), and an relatively easy and speedy 375x3 on deadlift. This had me confident with openers of 300/205/390.

However, 11 days out from the meet, I was planning on a 385 triple deadlift to gauge progress. I was sloppy in warm-ups and my first work set of 365x3 and tweaked my back due to lumbar rounding. I've done something similar before, but a *long* time ago before I seriously deadlifted. I was concerned I would be wrecked for the meet. I completed the workout, hit a pretty easy 385x1, some back off triples at 315 and sulked without too many tears. The next 10 days would be focused on heavy prehab, sleep, baths, whatever the heck I needed to not injure or embarrass myself. I felt tight the next 2 days but not nearly as bad as I feared. It was a non-issue leading up to the meet.

**MEET WEEK**

I wanted to experiment with a minor cut since this USPA meet had a 24 hour weigh-in. I intentionally bulked up from my last meet, with the plan to cut carbs and sodium on meet week to make weight. A week out on Friday 4-18, I was 171.4. I ate moderate-low carbs over the weekend and woke up Monday at 168.6. I trained M/T/W and hit easy and fast triples on my lifts. On Monday and Tuesday, I ate moderate carbs (~250g with ~50g fiber) since I was already under 169. I also water loaded starting Monday for fun. I usually drink 1.5 gallons or so on a workout day. I increased my intake probably 75% to over 2 gallons and somewhat decreased sodium (I have a pretty low sodium diet anyway). Wednesday, I woke at 167.8. I ate ~130g carbs (50g fiber) Wednesday, and about 70g (30g fiber) Thursday. Water on Wednesday was more normal, between 1 and 1.5 gallons. I woke Thursday at 167.4. Water on Thursday was normalish before noon, but then limited myself to finishing my daily allotment of ~.5 gallon throughout the rest of the day. I went to bed somewhat thirsty and was noticeably thirsty while sleeping.

Upon waking on Friday, I was thirsty but not miserable. I weighed 164.4. I had a hot salt bath in my back pocket, but didn't need it. Even if my scale was a little off, I knew I would shed at least a half pound before weigh-ins. I drove to the meet, urinated, and weighed 163.8 (74.3kg). I recomped with Pedialyte, glycerin, creatine, salty pretzels, bananas, bowl of protein grits with raisins, burger and fries with extra salt, some pizza (I started to taste ""too much fat"" about 65% through the pizza I ate), then ate normal for the rest of the day, still drinking Pedialyte and as much salt as felt reasonable. I think this was a good plan, but I'll listen to my body and eat less fat next time.

**MEET DAY**

**TL;DR** [-- VIDEO HERE --](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XV32JSmbBY)

I woke on meet day feeling refreshed, despite not sleeping as deep as I wanted (due to a combination of anxiety and excitement). I weighed 171.6, so I considered the recomp a success. I drove to the meet, ate a bowl of proatmeal, banana, pretzels, sat for an hour, then warmed up.

**Squat**

Warmups felt pretty strong. I hit 2 snappy singles with 275 about 10 minutes apart, so I felt confident with my 303.1 opener.


* 137.5kg (303.1lbs): 3 reds.

 When I hit the platform, the rack was too low, so they had to reset it. Maybe this caused me to rush. I set up and unracked the weight. Instantly the weight felt off-center to my left (visible in the video) and I kind of panicked. I'm confident the bar on the platform was stiffer than both what I train with and what I warmed up with, so it felt less stable. I wasn't prepared for the difference and I failed to adjust mentally. I thought reracking would be the end of the lift, so I told myself to just go for it regardless. I didn't commit to the lift, lost my cool, was scared, descended nervously, slowly, and wobbly, and cut depth short.

* Same weight. 3 whites. I wanted to go up for the second lift but didn't want to risk bombing out on the meet. The unrack was better but still shaky. I usually descend faster, but I guess the nerves just really got to me. Easy lift, despite how my face looked.

* 145kg (319.8): 7.5kg PR, 2 whites, 1 red (depth on left side). I decided to go for something conservative and just get a decent PR. I was initially planning on a second attempt of 145kg or 147.5kg, depending on how the first lift felt. Due to the shaky start, I chose conservatively. Pretty easy lift in retrospect, but the same descent issue. I would have loved another attempt, but that will have to wait for my next meet. Chalk this up to experience and let the frustration guide my focus for the future - no more sloppy lifts, stay tighter, commit to the lift, be aggressive.

Immediately after the third lift, I drank more Pedialyte, ate a banana, pretzels, and some protein/carb muffins I made the day before. This is similar to my nutrition from my last meet, and it really sits well with me. Very easy to digest and absorb.

**Bench**

Bench is currently my weakest lift, physically and mentally. I am often frustrated finding the groove and I think I just really need to hammer form. 

* 92.5kg (203.9): good lift and calmed the nerves. Smooth and pretty easy.

* 97.5kg (215): 2.5kg PR, 3 whites. I got out of the groove a couple inches off the chest. I never doubted completing the lift, but it could have been a LOT smoother. Due to losing the groove, I think I tapped far more of my strength than I could have. I hit a PR and likely already psyched myself out of hitting my third attempt.

* 100kg (220.5): 3 reds. The pause felt like forever, and I probably lost tightness. That said, I got it off the chest pretty well, but my triceps were shot and I couldn't lock it out. Maybe I had this weight on a better day where (1) I didn't psych myself out, and (2) my triceps weren't fatigued from a prior grinding rep. I don't know. I'm including this to document my thought process for the future, not to make excuses. It ultimately comes down to me being too weak, physically and technically to get the lift.

Same nutrition as after squat.

**Deadlift**

I definitely felt the fatigue setting in at this point. The most surprising feeling was sore abs. I must have really flexed them during squats, and I was concerned my core would be the limiting factor here. I made sure to limit my warmups to simply priming the CNS and greasing the groove. 2 singles at 365 were speedy but I felt some pain (fatigue, not injury) in my core. It was tired.

* 177.5kg (391.3): 2 whites, 1 red for not waiting for the down command.

* 190kg (418.9): 7.5kg PR. 3 whites. Pretty easy, although I got a flash of concern when it took a moment to break the floor. False alarm.

* 197.5kg (435.5): 15kg PR. 3 whites. I considered attempting 200kg, but I figured I'd get a solid PR and go more aggressive next meet when I don't bomb squats. I was pretty nervous for this, but I knew I had it when it got to my upper shins. I unconsciously did a mini-Richard Hawthorne nod when I knew I had it. I was pretty darn happy with this, especially after starting the meet on the wrong note. After seeing the video and the speed and smoothness of the lift, I'm even happier.

1wc5ze,weightroom,Sheiko Universal appropriate program review: Not my best work,"**Quick Summary:**

Age: 19

Height: 5'10

Weight: 155 > 163 lbs

Squat: 335 > 340

Bench: 240 > 245

Deadlift: 410 > 420

**Program:** The program is found here:http://sheiko-program.ru/training-programs/examples-of-programs

- I did both part 1 and part 2 of the program back to back, it runs 10 weeks in total
- I used my most recent maxes coming off an 5 week linear periodization 
* I followed the program *almost* exactly. I substituted deadlift off blocks with deadlifts at 10% lower weight, the first 4 weeks I ran OHP instead of Bench press on Saturdays because my chest was too beat up. As well I didn't have access to chains so I just did them vanilla.

- There were 2 days or so where the numbers went like: 70% 3+5+2+7+4+6. I didn't know what that meant so I just went with sets of 5's

- I didn't pause my deadlifts

**Diet:** I went on a small bulk over the first 6-7 weeks, I mean hey, it was Christmas. After that, I started doing Intermittent Fasting, following Silverhydra's Cheat Mode: http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/03/cheat-mode-the-official-guide/. I tried to eat at a maintenance for the last 3 weeks leading up to my test day. I'm most likely planning on keep eating at a maintenance until it's time to cut.


**Results: The good**

- First and foremost: holy shit finally broke 1000, goddamn that took a while. And if I'm able to maintain my strength levels while cutting to 148 for a meet, I could *potentially* break a few records

- I noticed my technique gotten a lot better, especially at <90% 1RM, but I'll get to that later

- I'm noticeably more muscular now, so that's a plus

- The usual 3 day a week Sheiko program is split into 4 days, so it's easier to recover from

- No terrible injuries occurred, so I'll count that. And I was able to finish all the workouts with relative ease

**The not so good:**


- While I found that the submaximal work was quite easy, things became A LOT harder above the 90% range, especially for the squat and bench, which came as a surprise to me, as I thought it would be much easier given how moving the weights at <90% felt

- I didn't put up the numbers I thought I could have. Going into test day, I thought I would have been able to put up 350/250/420 at least. But even the 95% were hard grinders for me, mainly for the squat and bench.

- My weaknesses became apparent at 95% and up. For the squat it was my back struggling to keep straight, for bench it was stabilizing the bar, and for deadlift it was from the knees up.

- Still intimidated by the heavier weights, a big weakness on my part.

**Overall:** Maybe this style of training isn't for me. The training sessions felt doable, even easy at times, but I just wasn't able to perform when it came to test day, especially in comparison to others that have done previous Sheiko programs. I guess training through volume and moderate intensity doesn't really work for me. But honestly, I came back from the gym really disappointed in myself.

**Moving forward:** I feel like training at a higher intensity might be what I need. I might also experiment more with autoregulation in my training. At this moment I'm considering a 5 days a week training scheme similar to GZCL's set up, working up to a daily minimum single at 80% and go from there (Around 5-10 singles between 80% at my daily max). I'm also considering putting something together that's similar to Dan Green's training style, but at this point I'm pretty lost as to how to proceed, so any advice going forward is appreciated.

1jq2iq,weightroom,"[Meet Report] Summer Strength Wars - Kennewick, WA, USA (445 kgs (981.1 lbs) @ 78.154 kgs (172.3 lbs) | RAW | M 20-23 | Wilks: 308.367","TL;DR - first meet ever, 165/90/190

**Background and Training**

I'm 20 years old, weigh about 177 lbs and stand about 5'10"". My experience with serious training began with Starting Strength in March 2012 and ran that for about 3.5 months until my lifts began to really stall in mid-May. I'd played sports all my life, so my lifts had already been decent (S - 5x330, B - 5x205, D - 5x365 when I stalled out). I switched to Madcow at that time, but didn't really have a lot of time to dedicate to lifting over the summer, and I went from the middle of September to the start of November not lifting heavy once due to another life circumstance. So I lifted, consistently, from November up until now, using Madcow all the way up until May this year when I hopped onto /u/gzcl's method. Using TheSquatRack.com, I have done 2 full cycles of the regular template, using mostly his recommendations for Tier 1 and 2 work with a few additions/substitutions of my own. 

I take fish oil, creatine, vitamin D, and a multivitamin daily. I did weigh about 192 around New Years of this year after gaining about 15 pounds of fat during the fall/winter, and spent this last spring cutting down to about 177. I'm maintaining at about 2300 cals per day.

**Meet Prep**

Averaged about 7.5 hours in the two weeks leading up to the meet (which is good for me). Did my deadlift opener about 9 days out, squat opener on the Monday of meet week, and bench opener on that Tuesday. Kept those two gym days light otherwise, and didn't really do any strenuous activity from Tuesday until the meet. I wasn't worried about making weight, but I low-carbed on Wednesday and Thursday, had a ton of water Tuesday-Thursday, and only had a protein bar & cup of coffee before weigh-ins on Friday evening. Weighed in at 172.3 - which SHOCKED me. I thought I'd be around 175 (which is what my bathroom scale said that morning), but apparently all the trips to the bathroom cut that down. Went to Red Robin to fuel up, taking full advantage of the bottomless steak fries. Was in bed by 11pm that night (wake up at 7:30), but I slept HORRIBLY. Was still awake at 1:30, woke up 3 times during the night, only got probably 2 cycles in...pre-meet jitters for sure. But I got out of bed feeling pretty good and ready to lift. I had breakfast when I woke up, something I have done less than 5 times since I started Intermittent Fasting over a year ago. I think I might have over done it on the food intake the night before and day of the meet.

[Video here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-WMGG0NYXI) 5/9 on the day.

**Squat**

1. 155 kgs (341.5 lbs) - 3 whites
2. 165 kgs (363.7 lbs) - 3 whites
3. 172.5 kgs (380.2 lbs) - no lift

Opener felt really good. It was finally nice to go out there and lift something heavy to get the jitters out. 2nd attempt went pretty nicely as well. It didn't feel like that much of a grind. I was feeling off to a great start, so I went for a 10 lb PR (my gym PR is 2x370 back in February). I got it halfway, started to stall, but I thought I still had it. The spotter behind me thought otherwise and helped me up. Personally still think he jumped the gun, but nothing I can do about it now. I also realize that I'm easily hitting depth, and might even be going too low.

**Bench**

1. 90 kgs (198.2 lbs) - 3 whites
2. 97.5 kgs (214.7 lbs) - no lift
3. 97.5 kgs (214.7 lbs) - no lift

My first attempt felt, and looked, SO good. I had done 205, paused, in training before, with relative ease, so I felt confident in doing a fairly large jump and setting a 10 lb PR. Well...it didn't go very well at all. One of the guys there said I let my air out on the way down during the 2nd attempt, so maybe that was it. I think it's more so that I'm just not strong enough. Definitely the low point of the meet for me.

**Deadlift**

1. 180 kgs (396.7 lbs) - 3 whites
2. 190 kgs (418.7 lbs) - 3 whites
3. 193 kgs (425.5 lbs) - no lift

For some reason, I came into these worrying that I would struggle. I'd done 395 & 405 plenty of times in training (usually for singles), but still, I had doubt. My opener went up quickly, but still felt kind of heavy. My all-time PR is 445 (did the full Magnusson/Ortmayer program ending in April), but I knew I wouldn't be able to hit that. 419 was definitely challenging and harder than it looked on the video. I went with 193 kgs on my 3rd just for the chance to set the Oregon state record in the deadlift, but I just had nothing left in the tank.

**Final Thoughts**

For my first meet, not a bad time. Being the only RAW competitor in the 20-23, 181 division, I won it by default (woohoo!). I would've liked to hit the 1,000 pound club, but it remains a goal. Toward the end of the meet, I was feeling slightly dehydrated, even though I was drinking water and sports drinks like a mad man and had to pee in between every one of my attempts. And after my 8th lift, I realized just how tired I was. My core and legs were both pretty dead, and going out for that last deadlift attempt I just had nothing left (even though I felt like I had eaten far too much food). That's another thing to work on next time - I need to get more pumped up for the lifts. I've probably been more psyched up for some gym lifts than I was for those.

I talked to a lot of guys and got a ton of great advice regarding meets. I really want to continue performing, but I was extremely humbled by some of the other guys there. A 56 y/o who just got his hip replaced in January squatted 500+, a 65 y/o benched 315, a 19 y/o totaled something like 1300 lbs...just damn. I really wish I asked more people about their training habits, though.

All of this has made me evaluate my progress so far as a strength athlete. I've been lifting, solidly, for over a year. Though it may be harsh to accept, I believe I've made terrible progress. I haven't really added that much to my main two leg lifts, and my bench has literally gone nowhere. I am going to really just pound away at my bench, starting now. I'm sick of not being able to really put up that much weight. I know I could eat more, too, and I see that as a mental barrier to further success as well. I am probably a little too down on myself, especially since it's my first meet, but I have high expectations and always want to be better. And it's just disheartening to see how little I've added to my lifts even though I am putting in the work each week (at least I think I am). I know I want to compete again, and I have a lot of work ahead of me!",2013-08-05 05:25:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1jq2iq/meet_report_summer_strength_wars_kennewick_wa_usa/
1drnjh,weightroom,"[Meet Report] USPA Midwest Regionals - Eaton, OH, US (1212.5lbs @ 164lbs | 394.17 Wilks)","**Background and Training**

Been lifting for just over 5 years now, but I've only been competitive for just over 1 year. Sometime last year I found out about USAPL Raw Nationals and how it doesn't have a qualifiying total, all you need is *a* total in a USAPL sanctioned meet and you're in. So I did a USAPL meet in November last year where I totaled 1135@177lbs. Given my bodyweight at the time and the numbers I was putting up, I knew that I needed to cut down to the 165lb weight class in order to even be somewhat competitive. I was also carrying a little extra fat which wasn't helping my wilks out either. Since USAPL Raw Nationals isn't until July 2013, I had plenty of time so I sat around 181lbs bw for a few months and just worked on gaining strength. On February 23, 2013 I competed in a local, unsanctioned meet where I totaled 1200@176.4lbs (445/245/510, bench was not paused). For that meet I was walking around at ~181lbs and tried waterloading for the first time and got to 176.4lbs for the weigh-in.

Right after that meet in February, I began cutting weight doing a cyclical ketogenic diet (w/ intermittent fasting) with 1-2 carb load nights a week. For me, the diet has been working out fanstastic and I've been on it for 10 weeks now. In that time I have not cut back on training volume at all, and I've been able to maintain/gain some strength while on it. I've lost around 10lbs and I'm now around 171-173lbs bodyweight. It took a few weeks to get used to it but now I can work off of 2000 calories a day and still feel pretty damn good as long as I do a massive carb load every 3-5 days.

As far as training goes I train 6-7 days a week doing a Westside style routine. I train at a local barbell club (Dirty Gym, Dayton, OH) and I have a couple coaches who do a lot of the programming for me. 


**Meet Prep**

I didn't start tapering for the meet until the Tuesday before. On that Tuesday I cut back a little on the squat volume and assistance work. Wednesday I worked up to my bench opener and hit that for 10 singles, then followed it up with some upper back/lat work. Then I rested Thursday and Friday.

For this meet I had a 24 hour weigh-in and I was walking around at about 171-172lbs, so I started water loading 6 days out, drinking around 1.5-2 gallons of water a day. I also did my last carb-load on the Sunday night prior and then went keto the rest of the week until weigh-ins. 2 days out from weigh-ins I cut sodium and drank a little over a gallon of water. 1 day out I continued on very low sodium and drank about a gallon of water in the morning then cut off fluid intake at around 7pm at night. The next morning I woke up at 166lbs on my home scale, so I figured I would be good by the time I arrived at the weigh-in (40 minute drive) as long as I wore a couple hooded sweatshirts and cranked the heat in my car, *wrong*, I got there and weighed in at 165.8lbs. I then proceeded to throw on my insulated running jacket, 2 hooded sweat shirts with the hoods up, sweat pants, and gloves and then drove around in my car for another 30 minutes with the heat cranked to 90. It got so hot in my car that my phone shut off! It did the trick though and I weighed in at 164lbs afterwards!

Post weigh-in celebration consisted of 2 bottles of pedialyte, 4 donuts, 3 bananas, dried mango, beef jerky, sweet potato chips, grande mocha from starbucks, and a bunch of other shit throughout the day. Next time I think I may keep this cleaner though because I got some pretty bad indigestion in the middle of the night and some of it carried over into the meet the next day.


**The Lifts**

[Video of lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlsr_02vtlE)

I currently don't have videos of my first 2 bench attempts, only my 3rd, still waiting on my friend to upload them.


**Squat**

**187.5kg (413.4lbs), 3 whites:** Felt a little heavy walking it out but I sunk it nice and deep and it flew up.

**200kg (440.9lbs), 3 whites:** Slight grind but it still went up without much trouble.

**205kg (451.9lbs), 3 reds:** I was fairly confident going into it that I was going to get this. I got all psyched up and yelled, but then got stuck coming out of the hole. I dive bombed it, my hips shot back, and I got stuck.


**Bench**

**107.5kg (237lbs), 3 whites:** Went up really easy, just as I had practiced on Wednesday.

**112.5kg (248lbs), 3 whites:** I got out of my groove on this one pushing it off my chest, so it went up slow, but at no point during the lift did I think I was going to fail it.

**115kg (253.5), 3 reds:** Got stuck coming off my chest, and my ass lifted off the bench to compensate as soon as that happened I knew I was done. I maybe could have got it but it would have required lifting my ass even higher off the bench to do so.


**Deadlift**

One of the side judges DID NOT like my deadlifts at all. My guess is because on the side where my grip is supinated my shoulder doesn't look like it is all the way back on the lockout.

**225kg (496lbs), 2 whites 1 red:** During the meet in February I had just missed getting a 3x bodyweight deadlift, and now since I lost weight, my opener at this meet was over 3x bodyweight and it was incredibly easy.

**232.5kg (512.6lbs), 2 whites 1 red:** Made sure to really exaggerate my lockout on this one but it still didn't please the side judge.

**237.5kg (523.6lbs), 2 whites 1 red:** Very happy with this, in February I got a [525 deadlift and hitched the fuck out of the lockout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYD-zIEEJYg), this time it went up smooth!


**Results**

I totaled 550kg (1212.5lbs), got first place in the Raw Open 165 class, and got [this sweet medal](http://imgur.com/tc4VYaa). My wilks was 394.17, so I didn't quite get my goal of 400, but 390 wilks is my goal for Raw Nationals in July since it will qualify me to compete at the Arnolds in 2014. So now I just need *at least* a repeat performance in July.


**Final thoughts**

I thought the meet was very well run. There was only 1 platform and with over 30+ lifters we were done by 3PM or so (it started at 10AM). The judging was pretty strict on things like squat depth, but in my opinion that's a plus. It was also pretty humbling since there were some *really* strong lifters there. Matt Wenning was there competing raw and I had seen him in his ""So you think you can squat"" video series but in person that guy is HYOOOOGE.

Overall I'm really happy with my performance, I've been cutting weight for the past 2.5 months and have maintained/gained some strength. I'm going to continue to cut a couple more pounds or else it's going to be pretty hard to make weight for Raw Nationals since I have to get to 163 with only a 2 hour weigh-in. I know I need to keep working on my bench form and I want to start incorporating more paused singles to get stronger off my chest. For squats, I'm going to start experimenting with different stances. I've been using the same stance for every squat variation (front, high bar, low bar) and I want to see if I'm any stronger with a wider stance. I also want to start doing more squat variations that put an emphasis on strength out of the hole like box squats and pause squats.

Looking forward to USAPL Raw Nationals now, going to continue training hard the next couple of months, and then after that I supposed IPL Worlds in Vegas is an option now since I beat the extremely high qualifying total (992lbs).",2013-05-06 02:21:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1drnjh/meet_report_uspa_midwest_regionals_eaton_oh_us/
pcrlp,weightroom,Plateau-ing and (some) pain. Questions about squat and upper-body exercises.,"Big-ish post. But before I say anything else, here's my numbers, nutrition, program
bodyweight: 135 lbs

nutrition: 

* Intermittent fasting (for convenience, I get severely bloated kinda quickly, and it gets in the way of studying, so I just eat at the same time every night, which happens to be the same time I finish training, if its  a training day.)
* 200-300 mg caffeine during fasting period
* 3000kcal/day
* 1g protein/pound bodyweight blah blah blah
* 3g fish oil/day (twice post training, but this is something i only recently started)

Reverse pyramid training, twice a week.
My top-sets are:

* Squat: 5x175
* Deadlift: 3x215
* Bench: 4x135
* Chinups: like 3. Sometimes 4. And sometimes 8.

I'll typically do three or four sets total per exercise.
I alternate with Squat+bench and Squat+deadlift days. Since I'm taking a weightlifting class (it's a free lifting period, we can do whatever we want) that's 1.5 hours long, I have more training time than usual.

This is where i think the first problem is. I wanted to make use of that extra time, so instead of doing my usual RPT for the first few weeks of this quarter, I've just been doing 5-8 sets of squats. Probably 5-8 reps each at 135 pounds. After, I'd do 5-8 sets on the bench for the same number of reps, or my 1-4 sets of as many deadlifts as I could.

I did this because I felt like more training volume/deloading could've helped me feel more comfortable under the bar after a few weeks into the quarter ( I think this worked, ) but I've been having some pains in my calves. First week of training, I had a very very painful cramp, and I'm always afraid it's just going to come back and kill me during a squat or deadlift set.

What can I do to help prevent this sorta cramping and give me the peace of mind that I *probably* won't be getting a bad cramp on a given day? I know pain is part of the game, but it shouldn't have to be a daily worry.

Another related issue is the way I set up my squat. I'm pretty sure now that I have the load evenly spread on my back. but sometimes my foot positioning is off. I keep checking my foot positioning, but I get too finnicky about it sometimes, and it's like a tiring 20-30 seconds until I start the lift! Should I just practice unracking an empty bar to get foot positioning down? haha

I've made close to little progress on any upper body training in the last year.

Sometimes, I can do a ""heavy"" set on the bench with 4-6 reps at 135 pounds, if I'm well rested, got enough caffeine. I can't consistenly do this, and I feel like I'm not making any progress overall. Knowing this, what kind of progression should I aim for in the next two months? (remainder of the quarter)

My only other ""direct"" upper body exercise is chinups. I may be overthinking this, but is it a good idea to ""cheat"" after the first few reps? (Using my legs to kick myself up) Is there any point in just straining hard through a rep while keeping the rest of my body totally still?

Last question. Knowing that I only have two training days ( this cannot be changed, so don't ask about it ), can I or should I throw in standing overhead presses? I don't know how that'll affect my other lifts, and they're pretty hard. ",2012-02-06 04:44:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pcrlp/plateauing_and_some_pain_questions_about_squat/

e1ysn1,longevity,Why this doctor started an online longevity clinic,"Hey - this Nathan from [BiohackStack.com](https://BiohackStack.com) with our first interview series with founders and leaders in the biohacking & longevity industry.

Today's interview is with [Dr. Sajad Zalzala](https://biohackstack.com/posts/dr-sajad-zalzala/), the founder of [QALYtude](https://qalytude.com) \-- a US-based online clinic that specializes in prescribing anti-aging therapies. We talk about how his company works, taking metformin, and also his personal biohacking stack.

# Hello, Dr. Zalzala! What’s your background, and what does your company do?

[QALYtude](https://qalytude.com) is an online clinic dedicated to providing easy access to longevity and healthspan therapies. Part of our mission is to accelerate the development of longevity therapies by supporting and participating in research.

The QALY part of the name is a health economic terms - Quality Adjusted Life Years - whereby 1 QALY = 1 perfect year of health. We want to empower our patients, and society more generally, to adopt the attitude to have more QALYs.

I am leveraging my experience with other telemedicine companies to make longevity prescriptions as easy to obtain as Viagra.

# What was your motivation behind Qalytude? How did the company start?

Ever since my first year in medical school, I gravitated towards holistic or integrative medicine. I find the field of prevention much more appealing than trying to treat diseases after they occur. Delaying the effects of aging is the mother of all prevention, as aging is at the root of almost all chronic diseases.

# How does the Qalytude prescription process work? Is it legal?

Yes, QALYtude is perfectly legal. We take advantage of fairly recent change in telemedicine laws to allow prescribing using an internet-only encounter. For those few states that have phone/video requirement, we adhere to those regulations by asking patients to book a brief consultation with the prescribing physician. We have physicians licensed in all 50 states, as well as US-based pharmacy partners based that ship to all 50 states.

# I know many people are curious about taking metformin for longevity (myself included). In your opinion, what factors should we be weighing in a decision to take metformin or any other (potentially) anti-aging prescription therapy? Should we wait for the results of the TAME trial (or similar FDA trials) before deciding?

Our goal at QALYtude is not to persuade anybody to start longevity therapies. We want to present the science and the studies and hope that people will make their own informed decisions. Once they have made up their mind that this is something they want to do, we make it easy for them to take action.

Metformin currently has enough data for me personally to feel comfortable not only taking it myself (and my wife), but also recommending it to my patients. I believe there will never be enough evidence to convince every skeptic on metformin and other longevity therapies - that's just how science (and life in general) works. Every individual will need to review the data and make a decision whether metformin and other therapies are right for them.

When we look to introduce other therapies, we work with a panel of expert advisors to vet out therapies that hold the most promise, but also a good safety protocol and are appropriate for prescribing by telemedicine.

# How safe is metformin? What can I expect if I decide to take metformin for anti-aging? Are there any useful biomarkers worth tracking while taking it?

Metformin is, in my opinion and experience, one of the safest prescriptions that a physician can prescribe. We have close to or more than 1 billion patient-years worth of data on metformin and it has been prescribed for over 60 years. Side effects from metformin are usually mild and can be remedied by adjusting the dose, or simply discontinuing. Serious side effects to metformin are rather rare. In the thousands of prescriptions I have written for metformin, I have not seen a single serious side effect.

The biggest concern with metformin is a condition called lactic acidosis - however, large studies have shown that it was not the metformin that caused lactic acidosis, but other comorbid conditions such as heart failure, hypoxia, sepsis, etc. that predisposes to lactic acidosis. In fact, the author of a 2004 Diabetes Care article concluded ""when metformin is used as labeled, the increased risk of lactic acidosis is either zero or so close to zero that it cannot be factored into ordinary clinical decision making.""

In terms of biomarkers, the easily accessible ones would be things like fasting glucose and insulin as well as a glucose/insulin oral glucose challenge test (where you take a certain amount of glucose ""challenge"" and check both glucose and insulin levels are certain time points - usually 30, 60, 90, and/or 180 minutes). We are also introducing soon the FreeStyle Libre CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) sensors that will give real-time and trackable data on glucose levels. More sophisticated testing will include DNA methylation testing such as the Horvath or GRIM clock tests that look at the ""age"" of a patient's DNA.

# What’s your take on the possibility that metformin [blunts adaptation to aerobic exercise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351883/)?  Do you recommend taking metformin at night (like Peter Attia) or on non-exercising days (like David Sinclair)?

I suspect ALL longevity therapies will come with some kind of trade-off. The key will be to find therapies that do much more good than any potential harm. On our FAQ page we address this issue. For patients who are performance athletes or working on a goal that involved lean body weight gain, I would recommend they skip metformin for that time. Or we tell patients to skip metformin on days where they are doing intense exercise (as per David Sinclair). As for everybody else, I think this study has very little clinical relevance.

# What’s your opinion on other potentially anti-aging therapies like NMN & NR, NAD+ therapies, rapamycin, Dasatanib, resveratrol, and quercetin? How do you decide which ones to offer through Qalytude?

We are huge fans of NAD+ - so much so that we are soon launching NAD+ patches that will be closest thing you can get to IV NAD+ infusions but at a much more affordable cost and convenience. For now, we are staying away from over-the-counter therapies since there are plenty of excellent (and sometimes not so excellent) companies providing these products.

More experimental therapies such as rapamycin and dasatinib are definitely on our radar and are very promising. But we are working with research organizations to provide these under a clinical trial setting in order to ensure proper safety and monitoring protocols, as well as to collect the data that is needed to help advance these therapies

# What has been the biggest challenge for Qalytude so far?

I think our biggest challenge is helping people change the way they think of their healthcare - to try to shift patients away from reactive ""sickcare"" into more proactive healthcare. The early adopters get it and these are our first customers. But we are a strongly entrenched system of diagnosing and treating diseases.

Another challenge is trying to show the value of the therapies we offer. Going back to that entrenched system - almost everybody wants to use that shiny insurance card in their wallet. But most do not realize that it provides ""sick"" insurance and not ""health"" insurance. We operate outside of the insurance system, but use technology to make our therapies convenient and affordable.

# What’s in your personal biohacking stack right now?

Currently, I take Metformin as the only medication. I use a CGM to try to keep my blood sugar as low as possible. I recently started using the NAD patches, which is not technically a medication but is only available by prescription. I find the NAD patches boost my energy and help with mental focus. The metformin helps keep my appetite under control and makes it easier for me to not gain weight so easily as I am prone to - it also puts a leash on my sweet tooth.

I tend to rotate the supplements I take, and change them up from time to time depending on a variety of factors including new research. On a fairly regular basis, I take: Omega-3, turmeric, resveratrol, vitamin K2, magnesium, CoQ10I do blood tests and hair mineral analysis to optimize my mineral and micronutrient levels. Sometimes this means taking a small bowl full of supplements for a few months at a time to get my levels optimized.

I track my visceral fat levels and other aspects of my body composition using the gold standard DXA scan through DexaFit (disclosure: I own the DexaFit Detroit location and I am medical director of several other locations around the country)I went gluten free in 2011 and haven't looked back (well, I am 95% gluten free). I try to adhere to a Paleo-style eating habit (I dislike the word diet) - though I do enjoy dairy.

I try to do intermittent fasting at least twice a week. And every year for Ramadan I fast for 30 days (no food or water from sun up to sun down).

My main source of exercise is running after my 3 kids.

I try hard not to neglect my sleep. Some of my friends tease me because I go to sleep so early (9 or 10pm depending on the season), but I hope to outlive them so the joke is on them :-)

I like trying stuff I read or hear about that have sound science. I subscribe to numerous podcasts, attend several conferences throughout the year, and do a lot of reading on new studies.

# What aspect of your life are you working to optimize the most?

I work hardest trying to keep my blood glucose levels low. I was overweight as a child, and that has set me up to being prone to gaining weight easily - I still have more weight on me than I care to admit. I find that if I eat just a little bit too many carbs, the weight comes back easily.

# What process do you use to evaluate what biohacks work for you?

As I have mentioned before, I use CGM to track my blood glucose, DXA scan to track my visceral fat, hair mineral analysis to track my mineral levels, and a comprehensive blood chemistry panel to make sure my thyroid and other hormones are optimized.

# What are the most impactful biohacks that worked for you and would recommend others check out?

By far the most impactful change that I have implemented was going gluten-free and switching to a Paleo style eating habit.

# What’s next for Qalytude? What are you excited for?

Currently, we are offering therapies that will help potentially delay the onset of age related disease. The really exciting longevity therapies have not even been developed or explored yet - things like senolytics that rid the body of ""zombie cells"" that seem to accelerate aging. I am excited to be a part of or support the research on these and other therapies. As well as other therapies that are being developed by much smarter people than me - those companies will need a platform to make their newer and stronger longevity therapies accessible, and we hope they will come to QALYtude.

# Is there anything else you want to let us know about Qalytude? Where can we learn more about you and your company?

My dream would be to see [QALYtude](https://qalytude.com) become a platform to help optimize human health - though this remains a concept at the moment.Also, QALYtude is registered as a PBC - a public benefit corporation. We are on a mission to help improve society and humanity.

d4pdrz,longevity,"David Sinclair's book ""Lifespan..."" is interesting, but can be misleading","Here's one example where the authors needlessly mislead with the citation they give to support their claims:  [https://imgur.com/a/6uVsbjc](https://imgur.com/a/6uVsbjc)

It's about resveratrol and how it, with intermittent fasting (IF), can ""greatly extend both average and maximum lifespan"" in mice.

He mentions an outlier that ""lived more than 3 years"". Great. Let's check the article (no paywall):  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2538685/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2538685/)

Just look at [Figure 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=2538685_nihms57083f4.jpg).

Figure 4e: While it is technically true that EODLR mice have an average lifespan that's significantly higher than EODR and EOD mice, what isn't mentioned is that - EODLR are mice that eat Every Other Day (EOD), and recieve a Low dose of Resveratrol (LR). So they actually live *longer* that EODR mice, which receive a ""normal"" dose of resveratrol. And there's no difference in average lifespan of EODR mice and EOD mice, which were just eating every other day, as their name implies. So one can't say ""resveratrol and EOD increase average lifespan"" because it's obviously dose-dependent. You **can** say, though, ""LOW DOSE of resveratrol and EOD increase average lifespan"".

If we take a look at Figure 4c, we see the proportion of surviving mice. Seems like there's one mouse in the EODLR group that made it over 156 weeks. But the brown line of EOD control mice seems to be following that blue line, and it also seems that one mouse has survived beyond that point. But no mice from the EODR group did. What does that tell us? You don't need resveratrol to push a mouse over 3 years. It also says - if you give a ""normal"" dose of resveratrol, it won't reach 3 years at all.

After seeing the original paper and the data: do you still believe that resveratrol and IF can ""**greatly** extend both average and maximum lifespan""?

I am not convinced. It's nuanced. There might be a dose of resveratrol that's able to exert harmful effects on an organism. And an ""ideal"" dose might be able to extend **average** lifespan with EOD feeding (which is **NOT** intermittent fasting in the typical sense btw!). As for greatly extending maximum lifespan? Nothing in the paper points to that conclusion.*

I realize they're not writing a scientific paper, a review, or a book chapter, but come on. This isn't the only thing btw, just the first example I wanted to share. Always read primary literature.

* **EDIT**: The paper mentions a 15% increase of maximum lifespan compared to standard diet, but only on low-dose resveratrol. High-dose resveratrol didn't confer the same advantage, so one can't say ""IF + Resveratrol"" (as a general statement) greatly extends lifespan. It's dose-dependent (""normal"" dose resveratrol doesn't extend lifespan in a combo with IF), and it's debatable if 15% can be described as ""greatly"".",2019-09-15 19:41:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/d4pdrz/david_sinclairs_book_lifespan_is_interesting_but/
alajlf,longevity,"I am 17, can I still take NMN, Reservaterol, and Metformin safely?","Saw David Sinclair speak about longevity on Joe Rogan's podcast, quite interesting stuff!

&#x200B;

Not sure if relevant but I don't think I'm growing anymore because I had puberty quite early (had growth spurt in middle school, haven't grown at all in like 4 years). (So I think I am developmentally an adult?)

&#x200B;

So can I still take NMN, Reservaterol, and Metformin safely?  Any advice on how to get started would be helpful. Also, should I try doing intermittent fasting or would that be bad for a 17-year-old?

6o4682,longevity,Dumb question about intermittent fasting versus calorie restriction,"Have benefits been shown for IF only as a method of CR? That is, if someone's BMR is 2000 calories, CR would have them eating 1400/day (or whatever it is). Would the same person doing IF eat 1400/day, but only during an 8-hour window, or would they eat their full 2000 calories during that time?

6e2aye,longevity,Is it possible top athletes are already self-medicating with anti-aging therapies?,"I'm not accusing any athletes of doping or taking any illegal medications or therapies, but I came across an article today which points out that the top 5 ranked male tennis players are all in their 30s. 
http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/tennis-roger-federer-rafael-nadal-stan-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-andy-murray-age-atp-french-open-4678315/
Only 10 years ago and there were only 5 players 30 and over in the top 50. Now there are 24! This trend can be found in other sports too.  Not so long ago, athletes were considered 'over the hill' by their late twenties.  Now it is common for athletes such as Mo Farah to win Gold medals at 33, boxers such as Wladamir Klitschko to compete for world titles at 41 etc. There is even a British female distance runner - Jo Pavey - who is still competing at the top of her event at the age of 43! http://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/40083960
As I said, not accusing these leading athletes of taking banned supplements, but even if it's just intermittent fasting and the like, is the slower aging of top athletes an indication that longevity treatments might already be in use and working?",2017-05-29 19:26:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/6e2aye/is_it_possible_top_athletes_are_already/
