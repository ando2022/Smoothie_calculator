1mtp3vq,gainit,"Male 5'7"" 17 years old, 59kg to 71kg. 2 years progression","So first picture me(in the middle ofc) 2 years ago(2023), I was approximately 59kg(130lbs). Second picture I am now(2025) 17 years old, 71kg(158lbs). Third picture is my admiration, Serge Nubret, the physique l'm trying to achieve, but I don't train like him lol.

Ik 2 years seem a bit long to achieve a physique like that but in the first year I left the gym to do MMA but on the mid year, I was fully committed to be a bodybuilder, and I also want to compete!
I'm still in School I'm a student, I love 70s-80s music and its lifestyle.

I train like Mike Mentzer(lf i did train like Nubret I'd probably lose all of my gains as natural).
So my routine/schedule is like this(while on a bulk):

Day 1: Chest and Back
Day 2: Rest
Day 3: Legs and Calves
Day 4: Rest
Day 5: Rest
Day 6: Shoulders, Triceps, Biceps and Forearms
Day 7: Rest

On Day 1 and Day 6, I hit abs before starting the following muscles parts and if im on a cut I train 5 times a week and also on cuts everyday I do abs except on leg days. But everyday after a workout I hope on the treadmill when cutting, leaving only Saturday and Sundays as Rest days
.
This is my routine(on a cut):
Day 1: Chest, Biceps and Forearms
Day 2: Legs and Calves
Day 3: Back, Triceps and Forearms
Day 4: Shoulders
Day 5: Rest
Day 6: (Lacking Muscles, I hit the muscles that I lack the muscles important for Aesthetic, for example Shoulders, Forearms, Calves, AND IK I LACK A LOT OF CALVES LOL.) 

About my Diet, on a BULK I eat everything i can, it can be clean and junk food(but not always junk food, its rare but not never.), I try to keep the calorie surplus every week and also as a boy staying with his mom I can't refuse what my mother prepared for dinner so I also keep that bulky during dinner I try to eat as much I can. And usually on bulks, the supplements that I take are Creatine and Tongkat Ali.
On a cut, its different, I eat clean, eliminate 100% of the junk food not even cheat days, and I also try to tell my mom what to cook during dinners and also what to prepare for school breaks. On cuts the supplement I take is usually protein shakes, Isolate Protein Powder, as on cuts Im on calorie deficit and need to lose fat, and when you’re eating fewer calories, it’s easy to also eat less protein without realizing. The problem is, if I don’t get enough protein, I risk losing muscle mass along with fat. The protein shake helps me hit my daily protein goal without adding too many extra calories. It’s basically a convenient way to protect my muscles while I’m cutting.

I don't want to chase a ""Mass-Monster"" like physique, I prefer classique physiques, aesthetic! And ofc l'm fully into Golden Era bodybuilding, I love it! *ITS ALL ABOUT THE 70s-80s!*",2025-08-18 15:23:36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mtp3vq
1mgu1m2,gainit,M32/68kg -> 73kg/5’11” (3years),"Yo fellas! — wanted to share my experience on my first real bulk now that I’m back in the gaining phase.

Stats:
Age: 32 | Height: 5’11” | Weight 73kg
Started lifting seriously a year ago (previously skinny-fat, did train - but not properly and never tracked a calorie) 
Bulked for 6 months, nothing crazy (300ish cal surplus) gained around 5kg 
Mini cut: 4 weeks, down 1.5kg 
Currently bulking again, back at the end of my first bulk weight (73kg) aiming for 80kg this time around.
 I’ve now learnt that gain in fat is inevitable on a bulk and that i just need to deal with it 😩


Training/Diet:
	•	PPL split, 5–6x/week — focus on progressive overload
	•	~300cal surplus, high protein, flexible with food choices
	•	Mini cut: ~300 cal deficit, same training, no cardio
	•	Sleep and recovery were huge (especially at 30+)
	•	Supplements: Just creatine, protein — full natty

1mfbkmm,gainit,"5'10: 120 -> 210 -> 170 ->174:  26M, 6 Year Journey","**tldr: Just lift heavy, eat, and be consistent**. Pics are when I was at 120, and now at 174

Hi everyone,

Started getting into fitness during 2nd year university. when I weighed 120 pounds. This was a period of my life where food was on the backburner, as I was so focused on studying, I would only foods that made me feel full (some days I would only eat a bag of peanuts). **Disclaimer, I only started exercising to get HEALTHY, I did not commit to this journey to get big, get girls, etc.,**

Started tracking my calories religiously (to the point where my parents were always commenting about it), started going to the university gym, 3 days a week. Did an internship which allowed me to buy some gym equipment to start building my own home gym. Commute to the University gym was 1 hour both ways so I wanted to save on the commute and have the convenience. The workout program I started with was AllPros Beginner Routine. I liked that it was full body and that it focused on the major compounds.

I was probably running that program for about a year. During this time I was still pretty rusty, I would watch YouTube videos on technique but the main challenge was always eating. Up until 2022 I was living at my parents, and was eating the foods that they would buy, and given that I was still in University, my funds were pretty low, so I relied heavily on foods like Lentils for my source of protein.

When I moved out in 2022, I started buying better sources of protein (chicken, turkey, beef), etc., and have basically built a diet that allows me to be consistent, hit macros, and calories.

After around 1 year of doing AllPros routine, I switched to Nsuns, and ever since I've been doing this program (occasionally switching from 6 day to 4 days). After I switched to Nsuns, I stopped entirely going to the Uni gym and exclusively worked out at home. I'm currently running the 6 day deadlift routine.  I built my home gym around this program, and I love the volume of this program.

I'm currently back to bulking, so my dairy products have a higher fat %. My diet consists of the following everyday.

Morning

* 55 grams of Cereal with milk (2%)

Lunch

* 190 grams of 2% Greek yoghurt with natural peanut butter (varies between 50-60 grams)

Snacks

* I drink a bag of milk throughout the day (these days it's 2%)
* Protein shakes (usually after the workout)
* Couple slices of bread
* Handful of greens (usually Spinach)

Dinner

* 200 grams of Pasta
* 1 pound of ground Turkey

Supplements

* Fish Oil
* Multi-vitamin
* Creatine

Now whether I'm bulking or cutting weight, I adjust the fat % of the dairy products I consume as an easy way to increase or decrease calories. And sometimes I'll get bored of the main protein and switch to another protein like ground beef or chicken. For bulking, I eat roughly around 3,300 calories, cutting I was down to around 2,000. This diet is boring, but it allows me to remain consistent.

Lifts (one rep max)

* Bench: Bar -> 240 (Bench is def my weakest compound)
* Conventional Deadlift: Bar  -> 430
* High Bar Back Squat: Bar -> 460
* Overhead Press: Bar -> 180

1mrpoul,xxfitness,Trouble sleeping on days that I run,"I'm quite an active person, I do exercise regularly. My weekly routine is a mix of strength training, Pilates, circuit training, calisthenics, and reformer mobility/stretch, plus I get in about 8k to 9k steps daily. 

I just recently started to add running to my regular exercises where I run once or twice a week, about 3km to 4km each time.

I've started seeing a pattern where on days when I run, I don't sleep well at night. It's either I can't fall asleep, or I sleep in fits and wake up every hour. The timing of my run in the daytime doesn't seem to affect this. It happens whether I run during my lunch hour or in the evening after work. 

I have anxiety and exercise helps me cope with it and I am usually out like a light because I'm tired after my exercise. So it's quite puzzling why running seems to have this effect on me. Just wondering if anyone has any ideas? 

I also take magnesium supplements in the evening about an hour before bed. The magnesium doesn't seem to have any effect on running days either. ",2025-08-16 08:55:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1mrpoul/trouble_sleeping_on_days_that_i_run/

1mvlna0,Biohackers,I kept forgetting my supplements so I built this… turned it into a template if anyone wants it.,"I’ve been experimenting with a small nootropics stack — L-Tyrosine, Magnesium L-Threonate, L-Theanine, B12, and some basics like creatine and fish oil.

Problem? I’d forget doses, mess up 5-on/2-off cycles, and lose consistency. Which basically kills the point of taking them.

So I built a tracker in Google Sheets:

* 🔥 Streaks (motivates me not to break the chain)
* 📆 Cycle support (e.g., creatine 5 days on, 2 off)
* ✅ Daily checkboxes for each supplement
* 🕒 Suggested timing & dosage reference right next to it

I’m 17 days straight on Tyrosine now (before I was lucky if I hit 50%). Already noticing a difference in focus and mood just from *not skipping*.

Screenshot of what it looks like (attached). Curious if anyone else here struggles with consistency or uses something similar?

If anyone wants to try the template, I made a cleaned-up version you can copy. DM me and I’ll share it.

PS  let me know what else I can add around to list of my supplements

1mvj62b,Biohackers,Glowing from within,"We see those people everywhere. They're not the ones counting calories or taking supplements or being too obsessed with their health. They're the ones who have incredible skin and sparkly eyes and are always smiling. 

If I were to compare them to someone who has their health together then yes, objectively, they need to up their game health-wise on paper. 

But IRL? They look and feel fucking incredible. 

They're energy is so gravitating. They can have a slice of pizza. They can smoke a cig here and there. No substance or food is ever in control of them. They exercise and sleep well. Most importantly: they are happy. 

A stark contrast between those who have perfect bodies, count their calories, and deprive themselves from food: look into their eyes and you will sense some lethargy and sadness and unrealized unhappiness. It's repelling. It's unattractive. Not a lot of people can put their finger on it because, I suspect, they become too distracted by the hot physique.

Take the comparison of Br\*yan Joh\*nson and Blake Shelton, for example. Sure, the former is obviously in better health. But if you ask a Martian or a pilgrim, who would they think represents what a human should look like? Who do you think a child would likely gravitate most to?

My point is, I think we're focused too much on the numbers and forget the energetic component of what it's like to be healthy. That's all.

1muvwag,Biohackers,Using Ai to Create Custom Stacks,"So I spent a lot of time with Chat GPT to figure out my “perfect” stack. I asked it to only recommend supplements that have been scientifically proven to work. I asked it to consider my age, sex, and other personal details. I told it I don’t want to waste a dime, so don’t recommend things that will not have an impact. I had it review it’s own recommendations over and over again. The results were: 

Morning 
	•	Coffee – for alertness/performance.
	•	L-Theanine 200mg – smooths caffeine buzz, helps focus.
	•	Vitamin C 500mg – immune support
	•	Thorne Multi – 1 cap here (7.5mg zinc, plus other micros).
	•	Omega-3 + CoQ10 – heart, joints, mitochondrial function.
	•	Creatine 5g – daily for strength, recovery, and cognitive support.

Evening (30–60 min before bed)
	•	Vitamin C 500mg – keeps immune support levels steady.
	•	ZMA (1 pill = 10mg zinc) 
	•	Magnesium Glycinate 200–300 mg 
	•	L-Theanine 200mg 
	•	Tart Cherry   

I have noticed a lot of people on Reddit seems to be anti-Ai, but doesn’t it provide us a good service? It’s referencing studies and making seemingly good recommendations. I’m not saying it can’t make mistakes, it can. But with some double checking by a human it seems to be very helpful.

1mvmbst,Supplements,Thiamine under tongue gave me incredible energy/focus/drive.,"I read a post recently that someone put the contents of their B-50 complex (minus the capsule) in their mouth, and got great energy from this delivery method.

As I have been taking high dose vitamin B for years I wondered if this would work, however I didn’t fancy trying this with a B-complex as they smell pretty bad, and didn’t want to taste that smell, lol.

So I emptied a capsule of Thiamin HCl, and bit-by-bit put some beneath my tongue until it had all dissolved (it tasted bitter, but not totally horrendous).

The effect was like the first time that I took the Sulbutiamine form of thiamine (regular swallow tablet method). So much energy, focus and drive. It peaked after around an hour, but still now after 5 - 6 hours i’m still feeling a sense of wellbeing from it.

Could this be the best way of absorbing supplements? Only in lower doses than regular dosed forms that are intended to swallowed. (For information I have taken approximately 500mg thiamine HCl daily for years, occasionally up to 1000mg a day, & have never felt anything like this).

Has anyone else tried thiamine under the tongue (sublingual)? 

I’m wondering if Sulbutiamine also is better absorbed this way…

1mvhalo,Supplements,Suggestions to improve performance during endurance competition,"I will be competing for my 3rd year in the [Rebelle Rally](https://www.rebellerally.com/). It is a 10 day offroad navigation competition where we are navigating completely analog with only maps and compass. I am the navigator so my day starts at 5am plotting checkpoints on a map for 2 hours, then 10+ hours in the car reading the map and terrain to directs us to those checkpoints. It is high stress and due to nerves, I typically run on little sleep during the competition.  Mental clarity, quick thinking, and accuracy is so important out there, and last year I noticed myself making more mistakes on the last few days. We placed 6th last year, and looking to move up in the standings this year.

Does anyone have suggestions on supplements I could try to help with the mental focus and recovery? The rally starts in October, so I have about 1.5 months to try them out. This would just be something short term for me. I typically only take magnesium, vitamin D, and colostrum. I also don't drink energy drinks and only have 1 cup of coffee a day as my body typically sustains energy throughout the day.

I’ve been into biohacking and longevity for quite a while now, and over time I’ve started working with both [DoNotAge](https://donotage.org?dna_link=549) and [Edubily](https://edubily.de/?ref=BENE) (two great companies in my opinion). As a result, my supplement collection has grown quite a bit.

I know some people will roll their eyes and say: ""Look, that’s exactly the kind of customer these companies love!"" and that’s fine. At the end of the day it’s my personal choice to take these supplements, and I stand by it.

I combine them with other parts of my routine like cryotherapy, HBOT, red light therapy, strength training, and sleep (as much as possible with a baby daughter at home 😅).

To stay consistent, I use two supplement boxes: one for the morning and one for the afternoon/evening. I can’t realistically add a third slot, so I only take supplements twice per day.

Here’s how I currently split them up:

Morning

* Quercetin
* Sulforaboost
* Berberine
* CoQ10
* Omega 3 (DoNotAge version)

* Apigenin
* Magnesium (Edubily 2:1:1 Complex)
* SIRT6 Activator
* Taurine
* L-Carnitine
* Premium Vegan Omega 3

I started with a 5 day fasting to clean my inner body.  
Before my fasting I was 72kg, after fasting I've got 67kg.

After eating healthy for 2 months I can say that nothing has changed that much. I even lost more kg, now I am 65kg.... ( and since I am 185cm tall I suppose 75kg would be at least the best with muscles on my body... )  
I worked out hard for 6 months straight to gain weight and muscles (which I did).. I ate everything and let me tell you, literally everything from healthy breakfasts to snacks after dinner... I was feeling better and looking better. I saw the results in the mirror.

Now, since I am eating healthy, all my motivation is gone. I am not working out anymore (only doing some push ups and pull ups, that's it).. I would not say I feel much better than before.. I just had a walk in the morning and all I was wishing is to eat some biscuits with black tea... suffering.

Yesterday I experimented with removing carbs and fruits (did it for only one day, but as soon as I woke up my scalp is still feeling bad, it is very itchy so seems like it is not the carbs that triggers my issues with my scalp)... I supposed if I will not eat carbs for one day at least I will not get itchy scalp in the morning which is a good sign.. Well, it is still itchy.  
Now I am thinking to remove meat ( I eat only beef since from my 2021 intolerance test I was positive for all other meats except beef) for a few days... but idk.. is it worth it? I don't think so... I am losing hope...

I thought eating healthy will improve my skin issues, but it doesn't.... I am really thinking about to go to the shop and buy some snacks and just don't care about it at all....  
I would not say I feel much better since I am eating healthy..  
I miss eating burgers, I miss ketchup, I miss mayo, I miss chips, I miss chocolate, I miss biscuits, I miss sandwiches, I miss bread, I miss orange juice.... I even don't eat eggs anymore... I miss eating 4-5 eggs in the morning and have energy.. I miss working out too...  
I am losing it.. really..

***fruits*** \- banana, apple, dragon fruit, berries, mandarins, oranges

***Meat*** \- ONLY BEEF steak and minced

NO processed and junk food at all..

1mqzmsl,weightroom,Program Review: Bench Every Day,"# The “Program” - Summary

The protocol here can be summarized as a 37-day protocol consisting of a daily 1 RM followed by back off sets of 5x3@85% or 5x2@90% alternating daily. The last week of the program is a taper with progressively fewer back off sets before a light day on day 36 and a final 1RM test on day 37. 

# Results

||Day 1|Day 37|Change (lbs)|Change (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bench Press|290|321|31|10.7%|
|Body Weight (Scale)|206.2|206.6|0.4|0.19%|
|Body Weight (Trend Weight, Macrofactor)|206.8|207.8|1.0|0.48%|

Bench day 37: [https://youtube.com/shorts/dTlsaJ\_SvYE?si=PmcgAJLx2xpelq-i](https://youtube.com/shorts/dTlsaJ_SvYE?si=PmcgAJLx2xpelq-i)

My bench was pretty stagnant before this program and 290 was my all time 1RM PR so these results were extremely positive in my context.

This is the tl;dr version of the post. When I was starting this program though I was pretty hungry to see other people describe their experiences with it. The rest is my far too lengthy attempt at doing that.

# The “Program” Details

It may not be fair to call this a program review as what I ran is really a study protocol opposed to a program proper. It’s not uncommon for studies to be designed in such a way to maximize the chance of finding an effect opposed to maximize the success of the lifter. That said, this was a protocol based off of similar work “in the trenches” with the end goal of driving up the 1RM on a given lift. 

Study 1:

Efficacy of Daily One-Repetition Maximum Bench Press Training in Physically Active Males and Females.

https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Efficacy+of+Daily+One-Repetition+Maximum+Bench+Press+Training+in...-a0828317501

This study put this protocol on my radar. Here a cohort of recreationally trained lifters engaged in a 38-day protocol consisting of a daily 1 RM followed by back off sets of 5x3@85% or 5x2@90% (lifters choice). At the tail end of the program they tapered and rested before attempting a final 1RM on day 38. 

The lifters here being recreationally trained college student lifters did mean my day 1 1RM of 290 was higher than all participants in the study. The strongest lifter in the study had a bench press improvement of 255–>290 for comparison, and this was the lowest absolute or relative improvement among the 3 male lifters. There was a real chance this only worked for those relatively new, weak, or unspecialized in bench press. However in this study they reference a previous study done assessing squat 1RMs in competitive lifters following a similar protocol. The actual point of this study was to see if a protocol which worked in well-trained, competitive lifters could also work in recreationally trained lifters.

Study 2:

Efficacy of daily one-repetition maximum training in well-trained powerlifters and

weightlifters: a case series

[https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3092/309245773040.pdf](https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3092/309245773040.pdf)

This study had a very similar protocol except it used alternating 5x3 and 5x2 days (opposed to being lifters choice), had a different taper prescription, and had the final 1RM test on day 37 instead of 38. 

Between the two studies we had a study on bench press on lifters weaker and less specialized than me and a study on squats on lifters stronger and more specialized than me. Putting these together I felt confident that these results have a good shot at applying to me as well. 

The authors of these studies also appeared on the Iron Culture podcast to discuss the studies and protocol: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKeaKsIzzhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKeaKsIzzhM)

# Prior to the program

Before running this program I was working with an online coach (Izzy of former PowerliftingToWin fame) and doing a sort of power-buildy thing in pursuit of both strength and size goals. I only had “competition” bench press at a once a week frequency with an emphasis on more hypertrophy oriented variants (generally emphasizing good ergonomics and longer ROM) for the other push slots. I also had standing overhead press in one of these push slots. I would describe this programming as quite low volume and overall I was pretty unsatisfied with the results across the board. The client-coach relationship sort of just dissolved at some point where he had stopped charging me and eventually stopped replying to me, and I was not happy enough with how things were going to hunt him down to start paying and being coached again.

I had been dealing with an adductor tweak from squats at this point so it felt like a good time to focus on my upper body. I was at near the top of my bulk and was hoping to convert some of the muscle I failed to gain into strength PRs.

# Technique improvements

In many ways what to expect on this program is pretty straight forward – imagine what happens when you bench press and amplify that manyfold.

Perhaps the most obvious consequence of this is that you will be getting multiple opportunities every day to really dial in your technique. If you’re used to performing the competition bench once a week like I was then it can be easy to simply *forget* some of the nuances you wanted to hone in by the time you perform the lift next. Even things that are super minor can feel worth drilling down on when you spend this much time doing the lift.

Some set up/technique and set up changes I made over the course of the 37 days include:

·         Looping resistance bands around the bench for traction so I didn’t slip backwards.

·         Wear an open-backed tank top so I could stick to the bench more easily than I can with a shirt, but put my belt on more easily than when shirtless.

·         Place something behind my bench so it could not move backwards when I was pushing back to set up my arch. This also let me be consistent with the placement of the bench relative to my power rack j-hooks.

·         Switch my set up from a feet-back set up which I would fight (and often fail) to get my heels down on to a feet relatively forward set up and really commit to pushing back into the arch.

·         Wet my shoes slightly with a spray bottle before the top set so they stuck better to the floor and didn’t slip forward when I push into my arch.

# Aches and Pains

The downside of this extreme exposure is that anything that is even slightly off ergonomically in your bench press is going to be dialed up to 10 as well. Even items that are below the threshold of actually being a problem you’re aware of will find a way to make themselves known at some point. I think that if you are going to engage in this sort of training you will have to commit to working through some lower level aches and pains that fall just short of the “I snapped my shit up” threshold. While this is not medical advice, and you very well may legitimately snap your shit up, if you’re considering attempting this I think you need to be ready to push things when it seems like it may be a sorta bad idea and trust that your body is rapidly adapting to this stressor. At no point did I have to miss a session or feel like my performance was significantly hampered due to pain.

Some of the issues I dealt with over the course of the 37 days include:

·         Some skin deterioration on my wrist from the wrist wraps. This was totally new to me on this program.

·         Some tendonitis-esque pain on my left elbow around the tricep insertion. This was totally new to me on this program.

·         Some skin deterioration on my shoulders where the resistance bands on the bench made contact with my skin. This was totally new to me on this program but benching with the bands in general was totally new for me.

·         Some neck pain and stiffness, perhaps from pushing my head back into the bench too hard. This could stick around for a week or so from the “tweak”. This is a neck pain I am somewhat prone to.

·         Some general soreness and stiffness or spasms in my pecs, especially around the insertions, and a feeling that something might tear at the bottom of my reps. The “tearing” sensation went away after a few sessions. This was totally new for me on this program.

·         Some feelings of shoulder instability, especially in my left shoulder, like it was too loose in the socket. This tended to get worse during back off sets and was especially bad when re-racking the weight. This would usually resolve within an hour or so from the last bench set. This was totally new for me on this program and was the most progressive of the aches and pains but it got significantly better over the taper period at the end.

One thing I will note is that I was reluctant to go into this program as I found myself having significant low back fatigue from bench press doing 3-4 sets of 4-8 reps once a week. This was to the point that my comp bench press volume was bottlenecked by my low back. I had never flat out injured my low back from bench press but I would dread getting into my arch on some sets and feel extremely stiff after my bench session. To my surprise none of this was an issue during this program. Despite the high frequency and trying to arch as hard as possible the lower reps meant less time holding an arch at one which seemed to entirely solve this issue for me. It’s possible my drop in squat and deadlift loads and frequency also helped here, but my bench fatigue was based on extension and did not generally seem tied to the flexion I performed on those lifts. Ultimately I just mention this to say if you’re a big arch bencher and holding that arch for a set of 8 paused reps fries your low back you may want to try giving this program a shot anyway.

Perhaps the larger lesson here is that if you have a specific reason you think you could not handle this program, you might be mistaken. I almost didn’t try it due to concerns around my low back and am very glad I didn’t quit before I even began.

# Diet

I use macrofactor to log my nutrition and prescribe calorie targets. I was doing a slow bulk prior to this and continued on that with the goal to gain \~1lbs per month. I seemed to gain a little more quickly than that for a good chunk of the 37 days only to drop near the end after spending a couple days out of town where my diet got fucky. Ultimately I wouldn’t recommend making rapid changes to your body weight when running this protocol. Losing weight can often have a negative impact on bench press in particular and this is not a hypertrophy program so gaining weight rapidly is even more likely than usual to result in disproportionate fat gain. One of the benefits of this program is really dialing in your technique as well, so changing what your body and leverages look like via rapid changes in body weight in either direction is likely at cross purposes with that goal.

The participants in the squat study general saw a very modest increase in body weight. I could not find information on the body weights in the bench press study.  

# Supplements

They used a 300+ mg dose of caffeine pre-workout alongside creatine in the studies. I used 5g of creatine daily and 2-400 mg of caffeine pre-workout on days I was lifting in the morning or early afternoon. I skipped caffeine on days I was lifting after work as I believe the negative impact on sleep quality and quantity would outweigh and benefits. I would not worry about *needing* the caffeine in the study to get positive results.

# The Warm Up

One thing I would encourage is to make your warm up as efficient as possible. Its summer here so I was generally physically warm enough that I didn’t need any cardio to get my sweaty but if it was winter I probably would have done 10 minutes or so to get the heart pumping. I would wear a hoodie and start the session with 135lbs x 5 reps and then 225 lbs x 1 rep. After this I would do 275 lbs which was my first “indicator weight” on how the day would likely go. As I got deeper in to the program 295lbs graduated from being a 1RM attempt that could go either way to being a second indicator weight (and eventually my first real indicator weight as 275 started to feel too light to matter). I’d generally rest 5 minutes between my last indicator weight and the max attempts.

I would also make sure the safeties were set appropriately during the warm up. I bench alone in my home gym and if I didn’t have the safeties then I’d run the risk of one of the daily 1RMS being my last. Seriously everyone, make sure you can fail safely on this program.

# The Daily Max

Based on how the last indicator set moved I’d select a weight for my first daily max attempt that I could almost certainly do. This should be an RPE 9.5ish which I am pretty confident I won’t fail but pretty confident I can’t double. If it goes well I’d add a little weight and go again. I’d rest at least 5 minutes between max attempts but would happily rest 10-15 near the end of the program if I thought an all-time PR was possible. On most days I would often stick to 5 minute rests between attempts but strength expression has been shown to benefit from very long rest periods so if a PR was within reach I wouldn’t hesitate to rest up.

If I took too greedy of a jump (over 5lbs) and failed the rep I would generally pull back to 5lbs over the last successful rep I performed and try that.

I wasn’t ashamed to use a pair of 0.5lbs microplates to chip out a 1 lbs PR on occasion when a full 5 lbs didn’t seem viable.

# The Back Offs

At the start of the program these back offs of 2@90% or 3@85% were pretty chill. As my max got higher and I got better at grinding it out the back off sets became more difficult but I was never at a real risk of failing them. RPE would generally be 8.5-10. The shoulder instability I mentioned above was the worst part here.

I’ll note that the squat study alternated the doubles and triples whereas the bench study let the lifter choose which they preferred. I’m not sure it really matters but I believe the authors of the bench study actually just misunderstood the protocol used in the squat study. I ultimately chose to alternate like in the squat study.

# Other Lifts

I did bench press first every day so after I was done I would complete 2-3 sets of 0-3 other exercises with an RPE of 8-10 to finish off the session. I didn’t avoid RPE 10 sets entirely but I did try to avoid failing or excessive grinding on any of these lifts.

I avoided any additional lifts directly using the bench muscles: triceps, pecs, or front/side delts.

# The Taper

I’ll note that I used the taper protocol from the squat study instead of the one in the bench study.

In the squat study all lifters had their highest (or tied with their highest) 1RM on the final test, whereas none of the lifters had a PR on the final test in the bench group. There’s no way for me to know if that is a causal relationship but for this reason I followed the taper from the squat study:

Days 31-32: 1RM + 3 back offs

Days 33-34: 1RM + 2 back offs

Day 35: 1RM + 1 back off

Day 36: 1@85% day 1 1RM

Day 37: 1 RM test

I think the taper over this final week contributed to hitting some new 1RM PRs prior to the final test day due to less cumulative fatigue.

# The Test

The final 1RM day is nothing too special since you’ll be used to attempting 1RMs by this point. I was very grateful to have hit 315 prior to the final day as it took the pressure off and any subsequent PRs were gravy at this point. I’ll just say I was generous with caffeine intake and with rest periods on this final test.",2025-08-15 14:35:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1mqzmsl/program_review_bench_every_day/
1mvlnt5,Nootropics,I kept forgetting my supplements so I built this… turned it into a template if anyone wants it.,"I’ve been experimenting with a small nootropics stack — L-Tyrosine, Magnesium L-Threonate, L-Theanine, B12, and some basics like creatine and fish oil.

Problem? I’d forget doses, mess up 5-on/2-off cycles, and lose consistency. Which basically kills the point of taking them.

So I built a tracker in Google Sheets:

* 🔥 Streaks (motivates me not to break the chain)
* 📆 Cycle support (e.g., creatine 5 days on, 2 off)
* ✅ Daily checkboxes for each supplement
* 🕒 Suggested timing & dosage reference right next to it

I’m 17 days straight on Tyrosine now (before I was lucky if I hit 50%). Already noticing a difference in focus and mood just from *not skipping*.

Screenshot of what it looks like (attached). Curious if anyone else here struggles with consistency or uses something similar?

If anyone wants to try the template, I made a cleaned-up version you can copy. DM me and I’ll share it.

PS  let me know what else I can add around to list of my supplements

1mvc4ei,Nootropics,Modafadil Cycle Help and supplement advice,"Hello, 

I recently started taking modafinil (200 mg, 4 times a week) on a 2 days on, 2 days off cycle. I'm using it off-label to manage depression-related fatigue and to help me maintain long, uninterrupted 8-hour study and work sessions after my regular 10-hour work shift. 

I haven't been tested for ADHD, so I don’t think I have it. Currently, I’m also taking the following supplements:  
- Fish oil  
- Multivitamin  
- Boron  
- Zinc  

My main question is whether there are any supplements that can help prevent my body from building up a tolerance to modafinil or help it react better to the drug. I've also heard about people mixing modafinil with phenylpiracetam, but I'm unsure if that would be a good option for my current situation. 

I plan to stick with this cycle for 3 to 6 months, then stop, as I need to push through my final semester of classes while also working my full-time job and taking on commission and paid work.",2025-08-20 11:26:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1mvc4ei/modafadil_cycle_help_and_supplement_advice/

1gspz9o,Switzerland,"Purchasing food, supplements, and medications from over the border regularly, delivery via Swiss Post or border Paket shop","I'm preparing for the changes to importing in January and normally I go shopping in Germany every 2-4 weeks pick up parcels from a paket shop, do groceries and in total it's about 2-400 Euros each time.

I go alone, and with the upcoming changes to limits from 300 - 150Sfr, I've been looking into:

\- shipping more directly to CH for the packages  
\- the penalties / risk of continuing to shop as I do now

Does anyone have a good sense that's recent, in the last 6 months to year, for:

\- How smoothly purchases of food, supplements, medications that are declared correctly at the sender end that are under 200SFr get through?  
If it's not smooth, how easy it is to correct it with Swiss Post/other shipping company, hours / days via email address or calling etc.?  
(a year or two ago I've seen this is unreliable and full of errors to say the least, though with services like iHerb applying auto taxes, at least some purchases are improved so it's possibly across the board)

\- The penalty/fines for not declaring (up to 5 times the duty + minimum fine of 50Sfr), importing at these amounts I've listed, if I'm to understand correctly, don't seem that high to risk (with how infrequent checks are and for lower total value purchases), though I'm wanting to understand more.  
Does it appear on a record? Can a comparison be made with it and a minor speeding fine, for example? Or ticket evasion on public transport?

Any advice / recommendations for the community of people who live with chronic illness and rely on supplies like this from abroad as they're not available here, are cheaper abroad, and who are already having difficulty paying bills is welcome.

It's from this community I've understood, that customs errors in receiving orders are quite common (though I didn't find out much about rectifying them) as we often buy from the same companies.

I also learnt that apparently for shipping items here, it's possible (note this is from me reading german conversational comments translated automatically so may not be 100% accurate):

\- Weight can possibly trigger the increased chance of a customs check, so over 5kg for packages  
\- Once a package is opened for inspection it is then taxed at the higher rate for all items (for some reason)  
\- It's very important to work with the seller to describe the value accurately, e.g. in the case of full purchase price v.s. sale price as an example.  
\- Having one single item (e.g. toothpaste) that isn't a food and medication in a shipment that is all other items food or medication, can prompt an inspection, and all items will be taxed given it was opened to be inspected.

I also learnt via searches here on Reddit the QuickZoll app is not reliable as a regular tool, and am not sure it even is the correct tool for purchases like mine (I downloaded it years ago, opened it once, then didn't proceed further for some reason).

In typing all the above, is it just the best way to keep my routine as it is and start lining up on the Swiss side to pay whatever is due there as well as the German side, as with all factors combined it's still less to shop this way? I'm assuming there's no administrative fee, I just pay the duties?

(Note. Yes, there are borders nearby that are unmanned / not open long hours though it's a detour so additional transport costs / time etc., just fyi in case anyone mentions that).

For the times I'm shipping in items where I can't use a Paket Shop, advice still very much welcome there or additional info. as shipping rates plus the chances of paying additional fees for customs charges (that may be charged in error) make that not a great option either.

Am hoping things have improved in the last year or so.

Thanks so much,

(note, written thoughts out loud, so anyone seeing something that doesn't sound right, it's likely a typo, worded clumsily, or I'm learning on the go here, working through it step by step, so thanks for understanding).",2024-11-16 15:44:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1gspz9o/purchasing_food_supplements_and_medications_from/

This review article aims to assess the severity of this issue by analyzing recent data, highlighting the need for enhanced regulations to ensure patient safety. Studies (N=174, Mostly Purchased ONLINE) have shown that approximately 36.6% ± 26.1 (%Mean ± SD) of dietary supplements are adulterated, and 57.5% ± 21.4 (%Mean ± SD) are misbranded. Unwanted ingredients, such as active substances like sildenafil and steroids, have been identified in supplements despite existing monitoring efforts. These ingredients, often found in energy-boosting supplements, contribute to significant health risks. However, there have been positive developments in regulatory oversight by the US FDA, including actively monitoring and analyzing supplements in the market and issuing warning letters to manufacturers based on their findings. These actions reflect a proactive approach to addressing the issue, enhancing consumer safety and confidence in the supplement industry. The findings emphasize the importance of improving surveillance and enforcement measures to protect public health better and ensure only safe products reach the market. The review of misbranded and adulterated US data supplements highlights a significant gap in existing research, emphasizing the need for further large-scale investigation. Comprehensive studies are essential to understand the scope of the issue, enhance consumer safety, and ensure the integrity of data supplement products in the market.

I see this across the market in general that if people were to take a sport drink at the gym, a protein powder, a multivitamin and a collagen supplement they would be having dangerous amounts of vitamin C. And its a common misconception that you body will be able to pass all of the excess. 

Are there are supplements on the market that are tablets and are just pure collagen? Does anyone else see this? Or have I completely misunderstood and you would need and use that extra vitamins C to process the collegen on top of what other vitamin C you might consume?

For the food systems nerds in this group, we'll also be discussing the systemic links between food access and overall health.

1kxwfin,nutrition,My Gluten Free meals + Workout plan,"Just wanted to drop in and share how I’ve been managing a gluten-free diet while focusing on building lean muscle. I’ve been GF for a couple of years now (Celiac), and I’m currently on a lean bulk. It’s definitely doable, you just gotta plan smart and keep your macros in check.

**Goals:**

* Lean muscle gain
* Keep inflammation down
* Stay energized for morning lifts

**Workout Yesterday:**

* Fasted morning: 20 mins incline treadmill walk
* Later in the day: Push Day
   * Bench Press: 4x6
   * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3x10
   * Cable Chest Flys: 3x12
   * Tricep Rope Pushdowns: 3x12
   * Finished with 15 mins core + some mobility work

**Meals Yesterday:**

**Breakfast (Post-workout):**

* 4 scrambled eggs cooked in ghee
* 1 cup roasted sweet potatoes
* 1/2 avocado
* Blueberries + a scoop of collagen protein in my coffee (unflavored, mixes well)

**Lunch:**  
Grabbed one of my meals from Eat Clean and popped it in the microwave. I’ve been loving their stuff for convenience. Yesterday I had:

* Adobo Chicken and Rice Bowl and grapes

**Dinner:**  
Honestly, I was wiped after a long day and couldn’t bring myself to cook. Ordered a gluten-free pizza from Domino’s. Chicken, spinach, and mushrooms on their GF crust. Not the cleanest option, but I still hit my protein and stayed within my carb range. Sometimes you gotta live a little 

**Supplements I’m using:**

* Creatine monohydrate (5g/day)
* Whey isolate (GF certified)
* Vitamin D3 + Magnesium
* Collagen peptides

I’m seeing steady progress, staying lean, and feeling good. I'm planning on cutting weight through the summer",2025-05-28 23:52:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1kxwfin/my_gluten_free_meals_workout_plan/

1kzt0ha,Smoothies,My ~1500 kcal Ultimate Morning Smoothie – What Would You Add or Remove?,"Hey r/nutrition,
I’ve been refining my daily smoothie to hit a wide range of nutrients, aiming for a solid foundation in the morning. It clocks in at around 1500 kcal and is consumed after ~750 ml of water to rehydrate and support digestion.

Here’s what’s currently in it:

🧃 Liquid Base

~500 ml homemade kefir (from raw milk)

~100 ml coconut milk


🍌 Fruits

1 banana

1 apple (with peel)

1 mandarin orange

100 g wild blueberries (frozen, organic)


> (Additionally, I eat 1 carrot, 1 tomato, and 1 bell pepper on the side — not blended)



🌾 Carbs & Fiber

100 g fine rolled oats

15 g chia seeds (with shell)

15 g flaxseeds (with shell)

1 tsp raw local honey


💪 Protein & Supplements

25 g whey protein

15 g collagen (Types I, II & III)

5 g L-glutamine

5 g creatine monohydrate




I'm also considering adding ~40 g of mixed nuts and a handful of spinach, but haven’t decided yet.

Goals:

Support long-term health

Improve recovery and gut health

Provide anti-inflammatory nutrients

Maintain energy and micronutrient density throughout the morning



Open to feedback:

What would you personally leave out or reduce?

Are there any smart additions I should consider to enhance bioavailability or nutrient synergy?

1k51p0r,Smoothies,Vitamix leafy green-heavy smoothies for 2 - prepped in advance - best practices & best model?,"I am in the market for a Vitamix but have never owned more than an immersion blender. My research has presented a handful of issues that I want to resolve prior to purchase.

Overview:

My partner and I both work long hours and can only feasibly make our smoothies the night before, preferably even earlier every Sunday (although this may be impractical). My understanding is that even prepping the night before use can create certain issues separation, texture, and nutrients loss, in some ways defeating the purpose which may end up being a deal-breaker.

Best practices for prepping in advance:

For smoothies prepped the night before, I have heard that air-tight containers like mason jars filled almost to the top to avoid oxygenation are best practices. Some say simply shaking them the next day is suitable. Others say blender bottles. Others say only make immediately before consumption (which would be a deal-breaker). I've also heard about nutritent loss due to oxygenation as well as the interaction of some commonly blended fruits like bananas and berries.

What is the best way to avoid separation and reblend at work or in the morning without use a blender?

Is nutrition loss a real issue?

How long in advance can they be made if I go the mason jar route? Can they be safely frozen?

What is a suitable size mason jar for a single serving? 8 oz? 16 oz? These are for health purposes only, primarily vegetable consumption. I drink multiple milk protein shakes daily.

Models:

I am looking at the 5200 or the Propel 750. I don't care much about the presets, but the stronger motor is appealing. However, I have heard the wider, lower profile containers that comes with the Propel 750 are best for blending 32 oz+ while the narrowed, taller profile container that comes with the 5200 is superior for blending smaller 32 oz batches.

Do my I have the basics correct? If so, the best model would seem to depend on whether best practices require me to make larger or smaller batches.

Any other important aspects I may be missing?

Ingredients:

Looking at primarily spinach/kale and other greens with as little sugar as possible so long as they're palatable. These smoothies are intended for nutrition, not for pleasure lol. Are there any other ingredients or supplements you would recommend? I've heard good things about hemp hearts amongst other things. Any other recommendations?

Quailty fresh fruits and veggies are not heavily available (f#ing Walmart 🙄) in my current location but I have some staples that I *think* are nutritious.  I buy all my fruit fresh, then wash & freeze.  I generally always use spinach, carrots, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, banana, chia seeds, almonds, ginger root, lime, lemon & water.  Recently I've also started adding a bit of orange. When available I add pineapple, strawberries and & watermelon.

y5gb93,Smoothies,Smoothies in every color throughout the week.,"Just want to share my recipes to make it a little bit interesting everytime. When I started making smoothies, I would pack everything I had in the mixture (blueberries, strawberries, peaches, kale, banana, pineapple, etc) but the color turned out brown. It tasted good but I really didn't like drinking the murky liquid. 

So what I did was, I focused on grouping together different colors of fruits and supplements to make my smoothies throughout the week. I read that we should eat as much color in a meal as possible to get the nutrients our body need. So that is my starting point.

Here are some smoothie combinations that I rotate throughout the week:

Red Smoothie: frozen dragon fruit, pears, mangosteen powder, pitted dates, pineapple juice

Green Smoothie: frozen fresh pineapple, kale, frozen apricots, dried stevia leaves, pineapple juice, wheatgrass powder

Yellow Smoothie: frozen mango or papaya, fresh turmeric, frozen bananas, frozen apricots, fresh ginger, dried stevia leaves, honey, soy milk

Berries Smoothie: frozen blueberries, frozen strawberries, frozen bananas or pineapples, coconut milk, pitted dates, toasted almond and oats granola, mangosteen powder

I focus on these 4 colors to supplement my efforts of eating fruits and veggies in my regular meals. I also take a powder fiber supplement and a barley juice shot in the morning. I used to do slow juicing but it's so much effort prepping all the fruits and cleaning up all the mess after is so tiring. 😬

I found that I like smoothie for now because of the fiber boost in my diet. In the future, when I feel up to it, I would like to do slow juicing again to add even more fruits and veggies to my diet. For now am very happy with my smoothies. 😊",2022-10-16 13:03:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smoothies/comments/y5gb93/smoothies_in_every_color_throughout_the_week/

9ezqd8,Smoothies,Adding caffeine/energy to a smoothie without coffee?,"Hi everyone!

&#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about adding caffeine or energy supplements to a smoothie without using ground coffee. I absolutely hate the taste of coffee --- I'm a big tea drinker. I was looking at raw powdered caffeine as an option, but it seems to be pretty dangerous. I definitely don't want any ""pre-workout powders"" because those are also fairly dangerous. I'm looking for something fairly natural, nothing super intense -- just a decent amount of energy that I can have in a breakfast smoothie that will get me through the morning. For context, my average cup of tea in the morning has approx. 70mg of caffeine, a little less than a cup of coffee, and I'll occasionally drink a soda, but in general I try to watch my caffeine intake. I'm not an energy drink junkie by any means.

srr6f4,HealthyFood,It is true that more than four tablespoons of whey will cause inflammation/ amino acid imbalance? Can someone explain this?,"I'm considering fulfilling all of my daily protein needs with whey. I came across the following passages, which claim that more than four tablespoons of whey will, ""overload cysteine and methionine, which causes inflammation"".

#1- Is this true? I can't find any source.
#2- I don't understand the claim being made. Is it that there is an absolute daily maximum of cysteine and methionine that you should be consuming, and crossing that threshold will lead to inflammation? OR is it that having an imbalance of amino acids too high in cysteine and methionine will lead to inflammation?

""Because of its neutral taste and its digestibility, it’s easy to go overboard with whey. Use around two tablespoons per day, up to four if you’re working out or recovering from injury. More whey than that will give you too much cysteine and methionine, which can contribute to inflammation. [...] People with a higher protein requirement (athletes, people with injuries) can balance the amino acid profile of whey and avoid inflammation by adding collagen instead of adding more whey."" https://www.bulletproof.com/supplements/macronutrients/how-to-choose-the-best-protein-powder-for-your-body/

o90pqm,HealthyFood,[Help] Advice on getting fruit in my diet?,"Hello there! To cut to the chase, I am a twenty something who hasn't eaten fruit since I was a child.

Probably sounds a bit ridiculous, I know, but to my knowledge I liked fruit as a very young child, but then around 5/6 I began despising the taste and texture of fruit and would consequently throw up whenever I tried it, or my mum tried to get me to eat it. Even when she would make smoothies, banana ice cream or something else it was always the same thing with me. I hate the taste and texture a, frankly, obscene amount and one the odd occasion I have attempted to try it again I have been sick immediately and really just want to try and improve that because although I luckily love vegetables I want to broaden my tastes and options for treats and whatnot.

I think at this point, there is definitely a mental aspect to it but the dislike and reaction to physically eating it is very much real.

So really I am just seeking advice on tips to sneak fruit into my diet, or vegetables that work as good substitutes for fruit. If there are supplements I can use too that'd be helpful to know too as I have really struggled finding any info online about this and have been too embarrassed to talk about it with others.

I love the feeling of a Sugar Rush, but there are health concerns that I want to avoid. Energy drinks cause heart problems, and are linked to several other health concerns over a lengthy period of time. I'm very protective of my body, and so, even though I enjoy the feeling of a sugar rush, I still want the sensation and feeling, without the health concerns.  


Eating healthy really doesn't do it for me. It gives me more energy, than if I were to eat poor, but it isn't like the same kind of energy as I get from a Sugar Rush. Currently, my diet / activity is primarily eating meat, salad supplements, and 10 minutes of exercise prior or after each meal. I am not an active person, otherwise, so please don't recommend things that will just balloon me.  


So, what other ways can I get a sugar rush?

iyaooy,HealthyFood,/r/HealthyFood Rules - Be sure to go over this before participating in the subreddit,"Welcome to /r/HealthyFood.  This sub is for discussion of specified foods which may be considered good for us.

---

# Subreddit Content Focus

 Posts should be an examination of a specified meal and its components. See rule 4 below for specific post requirements.

**On topic:** *""Here's what I ate, what do you think of it?""*  
**Off topic:** *""What should I eat?""*

**What the subreddit focus is about** 

* **The food** - /r/HealthyFood is currently limited to posts which share a single meal and ***is for sole focus on the food*** and its nutritional content *without any other context*. Posts should be akin to the /r/food subreddit but for food with a more healthful composition. 

**What the subreddit focus is not about** 

* **The person** - The following kinds of discussion should be directed to a subreddit more directly oriented to their topics or to a health professional: diet, food naming or listing requests, health concerns, fitness, categories of foods, general nutrition, and artificial foods or supplements. 

* **Fitness, diet, or medical / health related concerns** - *Discuss your diet with a professional who, unlike participants here, can base their advice on a proper background and education, test results, your medical history, and your eating trends / habits / issues*

* **Bashing on others** - DO NOT bash people for questions about specific foods / food items, or not consuming something to your standard of perfection

* **Activism or crusading** - It's fine to have a preference. Be diverse in your participation. Being an argument looking for a place to happen is not okay. Hyperbolic or inflammatory engagement is not okay


---

# Educate, don't berate

**Keep your cool and maintain perspective. Assume people are here to learn. Offer advice and counter opinions respectfully and include links to support your claims.**

People are here to learn - They do so by asking about their food, their recipe improvement attempts, and the science as they understand it (which may or may not be accurate). If you see something offered or stated which you don't believe to be ""healthy"" or factual, rather than get angry at them, respond to offer info with sources

People are built different and have different needs - Everybody is not the same and that's okay. People come in a variety of shapes, needs, and points of view.  What may be good for you may not be ideal for someone else

Getting shitty isn't going to help - How angry / right / informative you think you are is never an exception from the rules.  Being a dick does not succeed in anything except you coming across like a dick. It doesn't change minds or get anyone to consider your point.  Walk away if you are upset.  Report it if something violates the rules

---

# The Rules of /r/HealthyFood

The rule titles below are sufficient for 99.999% of participants. Most of this is to deal with spammers and those with food based anger issues.  Unfortunately, the added detail for each rule has made this lengthy. Thank all the rule lawyers and bad actors out there who made it necessary


### 1)  [Reddiquette+](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) is required. Don't be a dick

* Disagreements are fine but personal attacks and insults are not. Trolling, insults, or antagonism towards participants, moderators, or even the community itself will result in a ban
* No witch hunts or vote complaining
* No complaint posts or comments about this or any other subreddit.  Use modmail to discuss concerns about rules and moderation
* Don't make generalizations about the subreddit or participants - It's not backed by actual data and is rarely accurate.  Don't go there just because others did not emphatically agree or vote your way
* Avoid rude non-constructive comments - don't call someone's food disgusting, gross, or make any other non-constructive criticisms
* If you claim something is unhealthy, do so respectfully and provide a source (with links)^*
* Food / Diet / Portion shaming is not allowed - Assumptions, especially by shamers, are frequently wrong. People don't all have the same goals.  A picture may show something that is a rare treat or meant for more than one. Food images here often contain swaps for healthier ingredients but are meant to appear as something else. Don't assume, ask. Don't shame.



### 2) No dietary activism / crusading

Presenting a food based POV is fine as long as it is done *respectfully* and abides by the rules. Diet wars and diet crusading are NOT welcome in this subreddit. Being a diet fan is fine. Being either a jerk diet fan or anti-fan is not okay. DO NOT;

* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets / beliefs** - It's fine to disagree. Be informative without being rude
* **engage in diet crusading or food shaming** - instead, post an example of what you think is good
* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**
* **promote or argue ethics and morals** - this is often intended to be inflammatory or to shame. It is always off topic from the focus of this subreddit as morality and ethical labels do not change the nutritional aspects of food items.
* **promote diet absolutism** - your preferred diet is not the only healthy one. You CAN say ""it is best for me"" and explain what your favorite food approach emphasizes nutritionally.
* **make specious claims** - claiming a diet cures a chronic illness is not allowed.  Saying it ""can control the symptoms of"" is fine if that is truly the case but sources should be cited
* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - towards any subreddit, its posts, or comments
* **bias whine** - ""I'm downvoted because I'm (name food POV)"" is just shit stirring and a hollow attempt at playing victim / martyr
* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - avoid promoting a related sub no more than 1/10 of your activity

### 3) No self-promotion

This sub is under constant bombardment from spammers and self-promoters.  The moderators do not have the time to be wishy washy about this. **Any violation of this rule will result in a ban**

You may not post or comment here to discuss, link to, or include content from anything you are affiliated with, including; your works, service, product, app, article, blog, site, youtube or other video, survey, market research, funding drive, social media account, etc. Accounts showing up here with descriptions or history involving spam or promotion may be banned.

### 4) Post requirements

* **ALL posts require an approval process** 
* **Required post type and focus** - Posts must be an image of a single meal and will require an added info comment for approval (refer to the directions message sent to you after submitting the post). *The post's sole focus must be on the food itself, the single meal depicted.* 
* **Post context NOT allowed** - it may not include any context regarding personal food habits or goals, requests to list or name foods, diet, what's *bad* for you, fitness, medical concerns, health issues, cure claims, artificial food, or supplements. No Meta content (use modmail)
* **Image restrictions** - A single meal image only. No video, memes, screencaps, product or nutrition labels, other images with text. or any kind of placeholder image
* **Spam and promotion** - ZERO tolerance. ZERO chance of being approved and *will only result in a ban*. Do not link to or submit content from your own site, blog, video channel, social media, etc.
* **Add the required info comment** - After you submit the post, the following info must then be added to the comment section for post approval  

   > > **Name:** (name of the meal depicted)  
   > > **Macro / micro nutrient focus:** (Identify at least 2 which are abundant or minimal in the food shown. Naming categories of foods or diet types does not qualify)  
   > > **Ingredients list or Recipe:**  (what's in it or how do you make it)

### 5) No YouTube or other video

Due to the *extremely* high rate of YouTube and other video content sharing here being spam, off-topic, or having gross misinformation, all links and refences to YouTube and other video sources are no longer allowed and will be removed. Don't share, show, link, discuss, or identify videos / channels. Attempting to end run the rule via any means may result in a ban. *We mean it. No youtube or other video.*

### 6) New, low karma, and underage accounts are restricted

* Accounts which are new - May not post. Can participate in the comments. Spend a few weeks getting to know reddit and the sub before posting 
* Accounts with low / no karma - May not post. Can participate in the comments   
* Accounts with negative karma - May not post. Accounts with more than a little negative karma may not comment  
* Accounts by minors - May not post or make any form of dietary advice requests. *Do not give dietary advice to those under 18*  

*Note: Account age and karma amounts change periodically based on spam control needs*

### ...and that may not cover everything

Though extremely rare, posts and comments may be removed and accounts may be banned at moderator discretion for reasons other than those stated in the rules. It is not possible to provide a rule for every potential problem. For example, there is no rule regarding nuclear secrets yet we would not allow posts or comments about them in the sub. The best advice we can offer on this is; Don't be a dick in any way

---

## About user flair

In order to encourage comment participants to use and give heavier consideration to sourced claims, automod will set a user's flair to 'cites source' for a user when they include a link to any source in their last top level comment here (a top level comment is a response to the post, not to another comment)

---

## About modmails and appeals

Nearly without exception, removals, bans, and modmails about confusion are a result of skipping or skimming  rules and notices.

We currently have *less than* 3 human mods for a sub of over 3 million subscribers.  Spam requires most of our volunteer resources. We simply don't have spare time to wade in the mud of bad faith engagement.

*When modmailing, bad faith interaction, especially being dishonest, disingenuous, rude, antagonistic, or indignant, will always be counter productive and dead ends conversation.* Instead, be honest, straightforward, aware of the rules, and have self-awareness if you violated them. If you have a heated chip on your shoulder, take a breath before responding.

Things that are not a consideration for appeals; votes, what other people or subs do, your intent, what something costs, the amount of help / info you think you can provide, opinions of the rules, your favorite sweater, etc. Following the rules, being topical, or otherwise going out bounds are the only considerations

**Before appealing a removal** 

Read removal notices, rules, and posting page notices. Removal notices provide the reason and state your options. 

**Before appealing a ban** - 

* take a breath and be civil, understand any antagonism or other bad faith engagement will end discussion
* read communications to you from the mod team including automod. The ban notice states the ban reason and provides a link to relevant context (more than one comment or post may be involved)
* ban discussion and appeals are only handled via a response to the ban message. Do not create new modmail chains to discuss your ban 
* requests for an immediate undoing of a ban because you are new or suddenly found awareness of rules and notices will NOT be granted. There is ample heads up about the rules and the need to follow them.  There are no free passes.

## Moderators needed

We'd like to add about a dozen moderators. Working to make a positive place means dealing with the negatives so this is not 'fun'. You have to deal with pests and weeds and put in work regularly to have a great garden.  If you want to help, have more than a year of history on reddit, can offer a little time every day, and aren't a dietary crusader, send us a modmail and ask about joining the mod team.

^* About ""that's unhealthy"" comments - If you have a differing opinion from the poster or others in the comments about what is healthy, it's fine to disagree provided you A) help them understand your view by backing the claim with links to sources and B) avoid being rude about it in any way. Nobody is censoring you and in fact, we are striving for the opposite. *We want you to effectively get your point across*. We want people to learn from each other and to do so it should be a discussion based on science, not ""because I said so"", which is why we require the citation links. You get to give an opinion backed by facts and help others understand your point when you add links to sources. It is positive and productive and has an actual chance of convincing others to look at it from your perspective. It also gives the other party a chance to examine what you are basing your belief on and counter any possible misunderstandings you might have. Just commenting ""that's unhealthy"" is rude and does jack shit.",2020-09-23 14:01:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/iyaooy/rhealthyfood_rules_be_sure_to_go_over_this_before/

h85stp,HealthyFood,Why You Should Include Lean Protein to Your Meals.,"It is important to know the benefits of consuming lean protein at every meal. 

Professional athletes consume a wide variety of supplements including protein shakes, usually under the guidance of a sports nutritionist. While some supplements are made with good quality ingredients, the majority of them contain ingredients that are either unhealthy or have little nutritional value. Therefore, as a regular person who wants to get fit, gain muscle mass or lose weight, Mother Nature offers a wide variety of lean protein that you should include in every meal or snack to help you achieve your fitness goal.

What are your favourite lean sources of protein?

ghcknx,HealthyFood,Supplements and Protein Powder,"Hello everyone, so I've been working out for my health for the past 3 months and I've had decent results until the previous month where my body dramatically slowed down my progress. So I read a book called Bigger Leaner Stronger in order to improve the effectiveness of my workouts and stuff. So in the book, he had a lot of insights on a lot of things and supplements. One of the recommendations for supplements were to take multivitamins, preworkout, postworkout(creatine), and protein powder(whey). I also have been drinking tea for a while in the morning to help wake me up.  And I felt extremely overwhelmed because I honestly don't want to be drinking 5 things a day because that sounds insane. I was just wondering if there's anything you'd recommend as unnecessary. So my morning routine would be this, wake up and drink green tea with breakfast, then take a pre workout, and then workout, afterwards drink post workout and then a protein powder. And then in the middle of the day drink tea. But the more I think about this, the more I realize it's far too much. Is it unhealthy to do this? And does anyone have any recommendations. Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you.",2020-05-10 23:55:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyFood/comments/ghcknx/supplements_and_protein_powder/

I have been working out for some years now. I workout well but would like to increase my results in strength and aesthetics. I have just purchased whey protein isolates and looked at a report on its safeness on a site called “Labdoor” and found that it is relatively safe. 

However, I have come across a few articles that allude to whey protein not being necessary and being bad for digestive maybe even hormonal health. I have used protein previously and I notice that after I workout I am not sore for days opposite to  workouts where I did not use protein afterwards and this is why I continue to use it. I would like to ask, am I waisting my money?

uwdafj,veganrecipes,Looking for Vegan-ized New Mexican (Hispanic) recipes.,"Obviously I’m from New Mexico and I’m Hispanic. My mother is heavily skeptical on Veganism, and I’m trying to slowly inch my way into Veganism via making the sorta tough choices of picking meat out of my food etc. I’ve also gotten b12 supplements. However I’m kinda scared of losing touch with my Hispanic and New Mexican roots. And unlike you guys, I’m not a wizard in the kitchen, nor the mad scientist that you all are, so I’m looking here to see what you all got. If you’re interested in New Mexican Cuisine to see what you all can do with it here is a few basic things you will need to know along with a few of my favorite foods the last two being the most important Hispanic Foods, that are such staples that everyone in New Mexico knows of them.

Top things New Mexican Cuisine is known for:

1. Red or Green?
  New Mexico is the only State that has a State Question, that being “Red or Green?” If you come down here, and you order chili, that will the one question you will be asked unless it’s specified. We have the traditional Red Chili, and then we have my personal favorite, Hatch Green Chili. Chili is king here and it’s in damn near everything. We even have chili in our Hot Coco and chocolate bars. So I’m sorry if you got a sensitivity to heat but if you ever make your way to New Mexico, you are missing out if you don’t at least try a little bit of our chili — HOWEVER a lot of it has meat…

Green chili is often roasted to the point the skin blisters so we can peel the skin off and store the rest in the freezer to preserve the chili for winter because a day in winter without green chili stew should be a crime also note that Green Chili is spicier than Red.

2. Most Traditional New Mexican Dishes aren’t Vegan.
  Most of them are filled with Pork, Beef and Chicken. Reason being is that New Mexico is a desert and we haven’t recovered from any drought season that hits us. The longest one started on May 1, 2001, and ending on August 14, 2007. I believe this is the reason why meat products are favorable culturally, but I could be wrong.

3. Blue Corn, Hominy, Beans, Cornmeal, Cheese, Red and Green.
  These are basically the holy items of New Mexico.

Traditional Foods of New Mexico:

1.) Blue Corn Atole (I know this one is simple, just substitute the milk, but I thought that adding it might give you all something new to try!)

2.) Posole

3.) Stacked Red Chili Beef Enchiladas

4.) Stacked Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas

5.) Green Chile Stew

6.) Menudo

7.) Mole

8.) Chili Relleno

9.) Chorizo

10.) Biscochito

11.) Tamales",2022-05-23 23:25:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/comments/uwdafj/looking_for_veganized_new_mexican_hispanic_recipes/

i3oy0v,veganrecipes,New to vegan cooking!,"Hello friends!! 

I’m slowly trying to convert my diet to being vegan. To clarify: I can’t eat dairy, so that has been eradicated from my diet (oat milk is bae), and my two sticking points are eggs and wild caught salmon. I have severe heart disease in my family, and aside from animal rights and environmentalism, I want to ensure I can be old enough to give my kids a hard time. Other info on me, I am 27F, runner and cyclist and sometimes yogi. I’m not overweight and am not concerned about that. Just ensuring I have enough protein when I have active days. 

I have two primary questions that I hope I can get some resolution from you all :) 

1. What sort of supplements are you including in your diet (if any) to make up for nutrients that you don’t get from animal sources? I’m consulting with my doctor and herbalist to make sure I’m supplementing my body well. 

2. I wish I wasn’t this way, but I am so strange about textures of food. The texture of tempeh and tofu make me nauseous. If it bounces back I cannot stomach it 🤢I wish they didn’t!! I hate beyond burgers and beyond brats. I’m looking for whole food, unprocessed alternatives. I don’t care if I have to make my own black bean burgers—it is worth it to me in the end, and I love cooking. 

TLDR: do you have any supplements you recommend, and what are non processed protein sources that aren’t tempeh or tofu?

Bought a bunch of used equipment and set up a home gym December of last year. Trained using a pretty standard PPL 5 day split, but recently have moved over to a 6 day hybrid split. The whole time I have been going for high intensity and focusing on progressive overload every day. My sessions last about 1 hour now, never longer than 70 minutes I’d say.

Making sure I am getting 3500+ calories daily is where the weight gain has came from, also hitting 200-225 grams of protein daily. I get a lot of my calories from shakes. 

Supplements I take are: Whey isolate, creatine, casein, d3, zinc, omega3, magnesium, and ashgwandha. I have never used any form of PED.

1lratvq,gainit,"Progress Post: 150lbs -> 160lbs in 6 years, 40M, 70in","Maybe not your regular progress post because this is over a long period.

I started training with a PT in 2019, initially 4 times per week then 2, then took long breaks in between working out. So I didn't stay very strict until about a year ago. My mental health took a beating with my last relationship, so I decided to really focus on living the healthiest I can. I pretty much stopped drinking alcohol in January 2024, focused more on eating healthy and keeping my protein intake high. I struggle eating enough to bulk (that's fine, I'm confident with how I look now!). For supplements I take creatine in the morning (a tea-spoon full of it?), amino acid + caffeine powder. I'm a big fan of chicken-breast protein shakes (where I'm based they are available in yogurt flavor and supposedly provide 60g of protein per bottle!). Also NAC, Magnesium, Collagen – but don't think that does anything for my workouts.

Training routine of the last 6 months or so:

* Monday: Upper Body strength training
* Tuesday: Lower Body strength training
* Wednesday: Muay Thai  PT class
* Thursday: Upper Body strength training
* Friday: Lower Body strength training 
* Saturday: Muay Thai group class
* Sunday: Bouldering/Rock-Climbing

I try to put in a session of group class Muay Thai every other day as well. As I'm preparing for Spartan race (10k) I've also started with running (although I don't enjoy it too much). I've also done a few sessions of Barre, Pilates etc. and try to do one of these at least once a week.

I have all my body strength workouts tracked through an app that my PT built himself – so I know that by the time we took the photo in June 2025, I had done 408 PT sessions with him (since Nov 2020 when we started tracking, so probably 100 sessions or so more from March 2019). 

Being more consistent really changed me as a person – sometimes I still feel like I need to drag myself to the gym (like today, I had to do leg day – after running and doing reformer on Wednesday!), but waking up early (6:30am) and being done with my workout routine by 8:30am, feels epic every time.

Friends who haven't seen me in a while asked if this is AI – but no – it's just a lot of work. I might have lost the hair, but I certainly gained more confidence – and it rocks to have an eight-pack – haha (I say thanks to my genetic disposition!). Now I enjoy trying new sports (rock-climbing, bouldering.. I want to start doing some calisthenics).

My workout routine is quite diverse, if interested, I can add more information. I do not do squads or deadlifts – because I did hurt my lower back three times (posture is correct, but I seem to have a knack for hurting my lower back; no thanks to my genes there!).

What are things you like doing when you feel like you are approaching a (comfortable) plateau with your physique? E.g. I want to do calisthenics (maybe handstand?).. I would have wanted to try parkour, but I feel like I'm maybe getting too old to try? I'm staying away from racket sports because I'd be afraid to hurt my knees (but I enjoy Muay Thai and riding motocross/motorbike, which isn't really save for knees either).

Thanks for reading this! Have a wonderful day – and keep pushing! Yay!",2025-07-04 05:30:01,https://i.redd.it/9lyeu436jsaf1.jpeg
1l9fzun,gainit,4 Month Progress 125lbs - 147lbs,"(19M 5’8”) I started at 125lbs and ended up at 147lbs.
I’ve always struggled with eating enough food like a lot on this sub. around 4 months ago i finally managed to consistently eat more and this is the result. I never really tracked my calories since most of my food was from my dorm meal plan, but i’m guessing i was eating around 2300 - 2500 calories per day. Definitely not the healthiest food but i managed with what i had access to. 
For my split, I worked out 4 days a week (mon - thurs) using a funky workout program. the days were: chest + biceps, back + triceps, core + legs, and the last day was arms and shoulders. I found it from some influencer (I forget who) so i decided to try it out since it seemed different than the normal ppl and bro splits. At least for me, I found that it worked great. Since I worked out Monday to Thursday, I had ample time to recover each week. After getting used to it, my back workouts weren’t really hindered from doing biceps the day before.
For supplements, I had 5g of creatine, 300mg omega 3, 500mg calcium, and 120mcg k2 + d3.",2025-06-12 07:05:39,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l9fzun

1igp2s6,gainit,50kg -> 80kg -> 73kg 23M 5’9,"4 years of training total. First mirror pic in office is after just under 2 years of training.

Lifting routine. I started off at the very beginning doing push / pull and no legs. Realised quickly this was shit. Then I did all pro beginner for a while until I could bench my own body weight x1 . Then changed to Jamal browner powerlifting, got very strong and very injured. Stopped this and did Jeff nippard power building for about a year. Got decent gains from this.

 Then about a year ago I stopped lifting so heavy, started BJJ and changed to only doing full body (most sets to failure) with 1 compound a day . Day 1 - 4 sets of bench Day 2 - 3 Sets of front squats Day 3 RDL 2 sets HEAVY. Then for the rest of my muscles I just aim for minimum 8 sets a week, to be honest I kind of just go by “feel” now that I’ve trained a while. 

Going from 50kg to high 60s was by FAR the hardest. Had no idea about diet and calories and had to learn everything from scratch. I had a 1500 gainer calorie shake every night , which had protein, yoghurt, olive oil, peanut butter, oats and nutty butter. I had to force this down every night before bad which in retrospect was terrible for my sleep and gut but helped to put on weight a lot as I had SHIT appetite. After about 1.5 years of hardcore bulking my appetite had finally increased and I don’t need to do anything drastic to maintain my weight now at 70+ in fact I find it hard to lose now. 

Realised the biggest gains when cleaning up my diet, ensuring I eat vegetables every day. Started incorporating lot of supplements, (fish oil, tongkat ali, vitamin D, magnesium glycine, boron daily) I was deficient in vitamin d and magnesium so I think this has actually helped a lot.

I have been working out consistently for about 2 years, very seriously in the past 6 months with diet tracking and doing everything in my power to grow. Have been following 2 splits, first year bro split (chest, back, arms, legs and rest when i felt like it), PPL second year (push, pull, legs, rest). I started bulking at 3200 calories around a year and a half ago, and I am now at 3986 calories, 208p 132f 489c. Back then i felt big but now i realize how much more i have to grow. Every bodyparts have grown, especially legs and back, but side chest always felt like a weak pose and now i feel good about it. My push day rn is 2 sets of bench followed by 2 sets of inclined dumbbell press, with 2 sets of flies, 2 sets of lateral raises and 2 sets of standing overhead tricep cable extensions (with a 15-20reps warmup before first working set).

1gi5wqa,gainit,Dexa scan - lost muscle - ideas?,"Dear all, I am lost in my fitness journey and I am sharing in the hope someone has an idea. Not to be rude, but please don’t ask me if I do basic stuff like tracking my olive oil. I really think I have the basics covered. (But I am desperate :-) ) I also want to add I have no problems at all with how I look - but I do want some return on investment. 

I’ll give a lot more detail below but the story will end with a dexa scan showing I have gained 1,4 kg of fat and lost -900 grams of lean mass while aiming for muscle gain. 

Me
37y old female - 55 kg and 156 cm (121,2542 lb and 5’1.42 I think)

History 
I have been on a fitness journey for over 12 years. It has always been a struggle. I did start on way too low kcal, resulting in binges and also not seeing progress in the gym. I have always retained a loooot of water and even when my bodyfat% went down you did not see it because there is always a layer of ‘fluid’ under my skin. I cried about it and kept going.

2024
During this year I have reverse dieted slowly while following progress via a dexa scan and pictures. Every dexa scan (12 weeks of 8 weeks apart) showed a drop in fat and some muscle gains. Every time I increased my cals per day and kept that until the next scan. I started at 1900 kcals/day and everything went ok until 2400 kcals/day. Pictures: no results visible lol (cry).

General information: 
Vegetarian - I eat mostly very healthy but with occasional treat. I eat on higher end of protein to try to get all amino acids in. Now at 2455 kcals - 131 gr protein, 81 fat, 294 carbs). 
I focus on getting 30 gr protein per meal and am conscious of leucine content. 
I workout very early and have a pre workout with 40 gr carbs and post workout with 36 gr protein.
Supplements: intra workout BCAA (vegetarian…), Vitamin B12, Vit D, B alanine. I used creatine for months but I stopped. I was losing so much hair (yes I know studies don’t show this but I need to test the possibility it is a cause - hair loss stopped …).
I really aim for progressive overload in the gym. I do get stronger but nothing crazy. 1 RM evolution in 8 months:  Back squat from 60 kg to 72,5 kg - Bench press from 35 to 40 kg, shoulder press no big change (25 to 25,7 kg) - 1 RM deadlift is now 85 kg (not tested at beginning of year).
I have had a lot vague hormonal issues - more a lack of hormones. I am on contraception because otherwise I never menstruate and have very low female hormones. Also years ago I saw my testosterone is low (female low not compared to men).
Also recently visited a specialist in lipoedema to ask my fluid / lymph situation and there is something. She looked at my arms and legs for some seconds and saw the fluid layer. She did not give it a name. She wants me to train with compression garments to help my lymph drainage. It’s not doing much.  Have to go back in 3 months. 
This doctor also advised to see a functional doctor since she often sees a link in her patients with intolerances etc. I have invested a lot of money in testing in a functional doctors practice. I have the results mid November. However they are not into bodybuilding so maybe I can take some of your ideas into this conversation with them. 
I have developed a lot of allergies over the last months and years (skin care products, suddenly asthma). Was always bloated, have lactose intolerance - not gluten according to biopt but since cutting gluten I am way less bloated. 

Overview Dexa - kcals - Training
First 6 weeks - Started at 55 kg and body fat% 28,9
Training: 4-day split (Legs & Biceps - Back & Core - Legs & Triceps - Chest & Shoulders - Compound exercises 6-8 rep range and other 10 - 15 rep range). I push myself in the gym, for most exercises have 0-3 reps left in the tank. 
I do 10k steps a day & have a desk job. 
Play padel 2-3x 1h30 per week - some weeks I jog 30 mins or 1 hour in total; occasional swim.
Food: 1900 kcals 
Dexa result: -0,6 kg - lost over 900 gr of fat and gained almost 500 gr of lean mass. 

Next 11 weeks: up in kcals!
Training: after a deload week, again a 4-day split (Chest & Shoulders Quadriceps & Arms Back & Hamstrings Glutes, Core & Calves - Focus Hypertrofie 10-15 rep range)
Other movement comparable
Food: 2070 kcals
Dexa result: weight dropped marginally, lost over 900 gr fat - gained 700 gr of lean mass

Next 11 weeks: up in kcals!
Had a sports holiday - almost no cheating and a lot of movement during that week
Training: 4 day split (Chest & Arms Quadriceps & Shoulders Back & Hamstrings Glutes, Calves & Arms Compound : 6-8 range  Rest: 10-12-15). 
Other movement comparable
Food: 2185 kcals
Dexa result: weight dropped marginally, lost almost 800 gr fat - gained 645 gr of lean mass

Next 11 weeks: it’s working - let’s eat more!
Training full body for 10 weeks: so 4 times full body. Changing things up. 2 days focus on hypertrophy, 2 days on strength
Other movement: maybe a bit higher in hours compared to before (padel tournaments etc)
Food: 2333 cals
Dexa result: Lost 450 gr of fat - gained only 200 gr of lean mass (sad - did full body not work - Do I still not eat enough to build?) 

Next 7 weeks - following up closely since I wanted more muscle gains - up in kcals and back to 4 day split
Training: after deload week - 4 day split :Chest, Shoulders & Triceps, Legs & Core, Back & Biceps, Legs & Core.
Other movement: maybe a bit lower but step goal always check and padel also - just less ‘extra’
Food 2455 kcal
Dexa results: + 1,4 gr fat and lost almost 900 gr of lean mass

Last days before the scan I feel like I blow up - I am a watery girl so I thought it was water weight. I went +1kg on my scale at home. Did not expect this result. 

The questions:
Why the sudden drop in lean mass? 
If I am in a surplus kcals and maybe move a little less and my body fat goes up, fine, but why am I not gaining muscle? Does my body not now how to use the calories for muscle repair?
The pulmonologist started me on an inhaler for asthma 3 weeks ago (Inuvair - 100/6 microgram/dose Beclometasondiproprionate/formoterolfumarate dehydrate) -Could the steroids play a role?  Systemic uptake of steroids should be very low so… 
How to continue? Based on fat gain I would drop calories but why am I wasting muscle? 

Maybe example of a training session in this program:
Back & Biceps
Deadlift 4 sets 6-8 reps
Barbell wide row 4 sets 8-10 reps
Lat pullover 3 sets 10-12 reps
Latt pulldown 3 sets 8-10 reps + 1 to failure
Incline bicep curls 3 sets 10-12 reps
Biceps preacher curls 3 sets 6-8 reps (slow down)
Legs & Core
Back Squat 4 sets 6-8 reps
Incline leg press machine 3 sets 12-10-8 reps
Leg extension 50 reps in 4 sets with max 30 sec rest
Leg curl machine 3 sets 8-12 reps
Hip thrust 3 sets 12 reps
Jumping lunges 2 x 20
Russian Twist 3 sets 15 reps
Lying leg raises on bench 3 sets 15 reps
Plank + side plank: 30 sec each side 3 times. ",2024-11-02 20:41:38,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gi5wqa
1faunln,gainit,BOOK REVIEW: TACTICAL BARBELL MASS PROTOCOL (read this if you want to gain!),"**INTRO**

* Let me start at the end: buy this book.  I say that because, in the past, I asked about this book and was told by several people “You wouldn’t get anything out of it.  You’ve been training long enough that everything in it will be obvious to you.  If you’ve read the other Tactical Barbell Books, you already know all of this.”  And, like a sucker, I BELIEVED those folks, and that kept me away from this VERY enjoyable book.  And perhaps it’s because I’ve been slogging my way through Robert Sikes “Ketogenic Bodybuilding” book (which, I love Rob for his contributions to the field, but that book is DRY), but this was a total breath of fresh air, an easy and captivating read, and my favorite style of book: an “all-in-one” that manages to NOT be an 800 page tome.  So, with that, let me discuss this book, what is in it, why I like it, and why you should buy it.

**WHAT IT IS**

* The title really spells it out: this is the book that gets written when the dude behind “Tactical Barbell” writes a mass gaining book.  For those totally unfamiliar with Tactical Barbell: it’s a series of books written from the perspective of a dude with a background in special forces/operations AND SWAT style law enforcement.  It is this background that vectors his approach to physical training, similar to Brian Alsruhe’s background in counter-terrorism and martial arts.  In turn, his books (up until this point) were about building a “high speed/low drag” sorta athlete: well conditioned to be able to endure many hardships and be physically capable across multiple domains while also being strong for their bodyweight: NOT a 300lb strongman competitor.

* This background definitely comes to play in the Mass Protocol, because even though the goals have shifted, the philosophy and methodology remain the same.  It’s still very simple, to the point, reliant on a limited number of high return movements, based around percentages, with an emphasis on recovery and performance vectored toward the GOAL of improving mass specifically vs performance.  And, in turn, the author sets out to provide you ALL the tools you need to succeed.  By his own words, he “Army-proofed” the book, so anyone can make it work.

**WHAT’S INSIDE**

* This is what really won me over about the book: it’s absolutely the kind of book you could give to a trainee on day 1 and say “Read this, do what it says, and you’ll succeed”, AND it even gives you the tools to be able to say “Do this for the rest of your life and you’ll be fine.”  

*BASE BUILDING*

* After the book establishes intent with the reader, it starts out with a “Base Building” program, which already won me over.  As it sounds, Base Building is about getting in shape TO train: a CRUCIAL step that many new trainees attempt to bypass, which results in them failing HARD and early in their training.  I’ve lamenting on many occasions how the modern trainee tends to have a sedentary childhood, and lack of athletics/physical activity significantly hamstrings them compared to their peers that grew up playing sports year round, climbing trees, swimming in lakes, and in general just being what a kid is SUPPOSED to be.  Base Building will ideally help recover from that neglect: it’s based around VERY light weights at high repetitions for the weight training portion of the programming, followed by walking on non-lifting days as a means to improve conditioning.  Interestingly enough, the author ALSO speaks about the necessity of Base Building for those coming into Mass Building from a strength/power perspective: remarking on how all their time spent in the lower rep ranges to build maximal strength has unprepared them for the type of rep work in the Mass protocol.  From my own experience of going from drinking the Pavel “no more than 5 reps” Koolaid to repetition effort work in Westside Barbell, I can attest to that reality: I was “strong”, but that all went away when I tried to do a set of 12.

*MASS BUILDING*

* From Base Building, the book transitions to the actual Mass Protocol, broken down into 2 different sections: General Mass building, and Specialization.  Once again: the naming conventions are on-the-nose: General Mass Building are the programs one would use to add some general size to their frame, and specialization is what Stuart McRobert would refer to as a “finishing” program, or what John McCallum would refer to as…specialization.  It comes full circle folks.  5/3/1 BBB would be a great example of a “General Mass” style program: limited movements with a focus on hard work, whereas Building the Monolith could be seen as specialization: greater variety of assistance work and the emphasis on the yoke.

*PROGRAMMING*

* Without giving out ALL the content of the book, there are about 4 different General Mass programs and 2 different Specialization ones, each designed for 3 week blocks, based on a percentage of your 1rm, after which time you’ll up the 1rm weight and continue.  The author advocates a block/phasic approach to training based around these two protocols, with emphasis on one or the other dependent upon the trainee’s current proximity toward their goals.  He actually has an entire section dedicated specifically toward discussing how to set up training blocks with these protocols in order to set up training blocks of various lengths (which is why I wrote that we could give this to a trainee and give them tools for life), and even includes ways to integrate programming from previous Tactical Barbell books to be able to set up phases of strength, hypertrophy and conditioning training.  I really REALLY love that.  Much like what Jim Wendler did with 5/3/1 Forever, but even MORE prescriptive, for those that choke on freedom.

*CONDITIONING*

* It should shock absolutely no one that I was eager to get to the conditioning section of the book.  Despite the fact that “Tactical Barbell II” is one of my favorite books because it contains SO many conditioning ideas, the author does a fantastic job of “keeping the goal the goal” here and prescribes conditioning protocols that are VERY bare bones and utilitarian to the cause of gaining mass.  He frequently reminds the reader that the goal of mass building is TO BUILD MASS, and conditioning can quickly take away from that IF over/incorrectly utilized, thus he programs conditioning that is short and effective without so much intensity that it will burn out the trainee.  Conditioning requirements differ between the General Mass programs and the Specificity programs, which is even more incentive to alternate between the two: an opportunity to vary your conditioning.  Yet again: I really dig the prescriptiveness of this. 

*NUTRITION*

* I’ll admit flat out that I’m not a fan of the approach in the nutrition section, but I recognize this is a “me” issue.  The author prescribes an approach based around macro and calorie counting, laying down the exact amount of calories the trainee should eat, how much protein they should eat, and then a macro percentage breakdown to determine how much else to eat to achieve their goals.  I KNOW this method WILL flat out work: it’s just not how I like to do things.  Along with that, he’s very adamant about the necessity of carbs for the process of mass building, but he DOES at least on multiple occasions say things to the effect of “I don’t recommend a low carb/keto approach to mass building…but maybe you can get away with it”, which I’ll take as full license to do exactly that.

* But what I REALLY appreciate about the nutrition section is the blunt force instrument employed to the reader regarding WHY we’re eating this way: to gain mass.  The author makes a point to say it’s better to overeat than undereat, that the hard work of the program is going to limit fat gain, that when we’re gaining mass we need to do the things necessary to actually gain mass, etc.  The constant reinforcement of this is key, especially with so many junior trainees that are so brainwashed by the “365 abs” of social media that the notion of ever letting their midsection get blurry in the pursuit of actually putting on some muscle is completely alien.  It’s refreshing to see someone really take nutrition to task.

* The author also does a great job of emphasizing the value of wholesome, quality foods to achieve the nutrition goals, and he doesn’t shy away from meat to get protein.  There is no appeal to a plant based approach here.  He brings up quality protein supplements as well to bridge nutritional gaps, includes a brief discussion on supplements, advocates for a weekly cheat day, and does NOT try to find a way to make alcohol fit in the program.  He even includes specific recommendations for skinnier trainees vs fatbody trainees, and details how to eat during the Base Building blocks vs the other blocks.  Once again: everything you need to succeed.

*SUMMARY*

* Once again, I am reviewing the book here, rather than the method, simply because I haven’t had an opportunity to employ it (yet: I’m excited to give it a try!).  That said: this book is awesome.  Its $10 on amazon and gives you all the tools you need to succeed in your training.  It can be read in an afternoon, and re-read multiple times for inspiration.  Even if none of this is new to you, it can be incredibly refreshing to strip things down to the basics and remember the HOW and WHY behind what we do.

* Buy this book.",2024-09-07 00:41:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1faunln/book_review_tactical_barbell_mass_protocol_read/

1dy1v7s,gainit,"Year 1 -> Year 2 (M25, 6'0: 183 lbs -> 217 lbs -> 195lbs)","# PROGRESS PICS: [https://imgur.com/a/kqpXGyv](https://imgur.com/a/kqpXGyv)

# Preface

* Starting weight: 183lbs
* Ending weight: 195 lbs
* Age: 25-26 years old
* Height: 6'0

Hi everyone, so if you've visited this community some time last year you might recognize me from a previous post where I shared my progress for the first year of my training. The first imgur picture is a bit misleading. I went from the 2nd pic (183 lbs) to the 3rd pic (195 lbs). The first pic (164 lbs) is from my previous post but I thought I'd show it this way so the whole 2 year progression can be seen. Since my previous post received a lot of attention and people were interested in my progress, I've decided to make a sequel with even more detail.

# Diet

For my diet I followed the same method of calculating my TDEE from last year. For those unfamiliar, TDEE is a number that is calculated based off weight and height, and it gives you the number of calories you need to hit every day to maintain my weight. For example, for my current height and weight (6'0 and 195 lbs) I would need about 2616 calories per day. This means if I ate exactly that amount of food everyday, my weight should not change. This tool is great because depending on whether you plan to bulk or cut, the number you need to hit is very easy to find out.

**\*Supplements\***

For supplements I only take protein powder, creatine, and preworkout. You don't really need supplements tbh but they can help alot for hitting macros or energy and they're pretty cheap if you know where to look. I also take melatonin gummies sometimes but that's just because I have trouble sleeping due to irregular sleep schedules when I'm very busy.

**\*Approach\***

For my meals I tend to keep them as simple and consistent as possible. This is definitely the biggest hurdle for people to get their diet right. They know what they should eat but it's not easy for them, like how do you expect to eat rice, broccoli and chicken breast everyday? The answer is you don't (sort of). I'm going to talk about the foods I used for bulking and cutting below but the secret of my consistency is to eat ALMOST the same thing every day. I try to change the variations up all the time with each variation of meals hitting my calories so things aren't boring all the time. You can do this in many clever ways like substituting rice for noodles, chicken for beef/pork/fish, broccoli for other vegetables, and trying new sauces. There really isn't much variation in macros as long as you get a decent amount of protein in. You might say ""Oh but don't chicken thighs have worse protein to fat ratios than chicken breast so it's not as good?"". You are correct but would you rather have a bland flavourless chicken breast or a juicy chicken thigh covered in low calorie sauce for dinner? Even if you do stick with chicken breast all the time, you'll probably stop at some point and relapse to unhealthier foods just because having that everyday is so difficult. It's better to accept some variation and flavour if it means consistency. A moderate consistent diet is better than an overly optimal one that is a chore to maintain. If you need help with finding food macros I suggest MyFitnessPal (also I don't factor in calories burned when using this app)

**\*Bulking\***

For bulking my strategy is to lean bulk at approx. 0.5 lbs per week for as long as possible. This means taking my TDEE and adding about 300 calories. In this case if I wanted to bulk now I would need to eat on average 2616 + 300 = 2916 calories everyday. I don't have a goal number to end the bulk necessarily but I try to lean bulk consistently for as long as possible, most likely 9+ months. This is because lean bulking (slowly increasing calories as weight increases) is the most effective method for gaining muscle without excess fat. Lean bulking is so effective in fact that even if I didn't train as well I would still gain strength (especially for beginners). This is why diet is so much more important than training and also why i'm talking about it first. I listed a sample meal plan with associated calories and alternative foods below. I also eat protein powder with yogurt mixed with a bit of water for consistency because it tastes better than just water + protein powder.

Breakfast (746 cal)

* 1 bagel (230 cal)
   * toast / tortilla
* 1 avocado (240 cal)
   * sauce / deli / any meat
* 2 boiled eggs (156 cal)
   * sauce / deli / any meat
* 1 can tuna (120 cal)

Lunch (857 cal)

* 200g cup Skyr/Greek yogurt (147 cal)
* 2 cups protein powder (240 cal)
* 2 tablespoons peanut butter (200 cal)
* 0.25 cup frozen fruit (70 cal)
   * any fresh fruit tbh, they're all low calories
* 1 cookie (200 cal)
   * any cookie with good texture with similar calories, this is only for flavour tbh

Dinner (1370 cal)

* 1.5 cups of cooked rice (300 cal)
   * 1 cup of noodles/pasta
* 1 cup frozen vegetables (70 cal)
   * any other vegetable
* \~0.75 lb chicken thighs (580 cal)
   * ground beef / sausage / chicken breast / steak / fish
* 2 tbsp any sauce (200 cal)
* 2 tbsp peanut butter (200 cal)

---Total: 2973 cal---

**\*Cutting\***

With cutting not much has changed from bulking. I simply removed a few high calorie items like peanut butter and eat less in general. This way my habit of eating food is not too drastic and easy to transition to. I also don't eat breakfast as I do intermittent fasting when cutting out of convenience. For me eating 3 big meals in a time window is more effective than having smaller meals across the whole day. Energy is pretty important when it comes to cutting so having a meal 2 hrs before working out or taking pre workout immediately beforehand can be very useful for getting through the whole workout. I start cutting for summer usually around March which is when I also start feeling too fat and I'm getting diminishing returns from lean bulking. I tend to cut at a pace of 1 lb per week so this means taking my TDEE at my bulked weight and taking 500 calories off. For example if I were to continue cutting now I would need 2616 - 500 = 2116 calories per day.

Lunch (630 cal)

* Tortilla (320 cal)
   * toast / bagel
* 3x scrambled eggs (210 cal)
   * canned fish / deli / any low fat meat / avocado
* any sauce (100 cal)
   * any sauce with low calories like <100 calories per 15 ml

Dinner (1100 cal)

* 1 cups of cooked rice (200 cal)
   * 1 cup of noodles/pasta
* 1 cup frozen vegetables (104 cal)
   * any other vegetable (they're pretty much all low calories anyway)
* 0.75 lb chicken thighs (696 cal)

# Training

**\*Compound lift PRs\***

* Squat: 385 lbs x 1 -> 405 lbs x 1
* Bench: 205 lbs x 1 -> 225 lbs x 6
* (Conventional) Deadlift: 475 lbs x 1 -> 545 lbs x 1
* Barbell rows: 275 lbs x 4

**\*Other random lift PRs\***

* RDLs: 425 lbs x 5
* Tricep pushdown: 210 lbs x 12
* Hammer curls: 65 lbs x 8
* Lat raises: 50 lbs x 10

**\*Approach\***

My training approach hasn't really changed much since last year. I mainly train for hypertrophy and sometimes focus on strength. I tend to get bored of training solely focusing on powerlifting or bodybuilding style training so I change training approaches frequently. This is similar to my approach in dieting as I'm not focusing solely training for optimal results but factoring in what is most fun for me at the moment. It works well for me, even though I could be theoretically stronger by specializing in one area, because training with fun as a priority makes you more consistent if you look forward to training.

Another approach I implemented is focusing on specific muscle types more than others. Popular training plans like PPL give an equal focus on upper and lower body muscles but I find that some people like myself have better inherent strength in certain muscles than others. For example, my lower body is way stronger than my upper body even accounting for the usual strength difference between the two. I always had big legs so instead of giving equal attention to legs I typically only do it once a week, sometimes even doing 3 sets of squats and then just doing back exercises for the rest of the ""leg day"". I also do have knee injuries rn so that's why I haven't been squatting consistently for months now.

Certain muscles can recover faster than others. That's why I deadlift with max effort infrequently and always with long rest periods (3+ mins) but can get away with bench pressing with high effort multiple times a week with low rest periods (1-2 mins). The order for exercises is also important. Typically it's better to do compound lifts (benching, squatting, deadlifts, OHP, barbell rows) at the start of your workout because they require more muscles to use and save the isolation exercises like arm exercises for the last part.

In order to simplify my workouts I typically don't have much variation as I find that overcomplicated training can lead to inefficient results. Just because some influencer says you should do an elaborate workout that will target some obscure tiny muscle doesn't mean it's good for you. Maybe if you're more experienced you should put more emphasis on them but that's because everything else should already be developed by then. Typically compound exercises and a few isolation exercises for bigger muscles like lats, delts, hamstrings are good enough when starting out, which is why you'll recognize almost all the exercises I list below.

In order to track my progress I typically use an input spreadsheet. It's super easy because you just need to input your 1RM (I typically do 90% of my actual PR) and it calculates all the sets and rep ranges for you. You can find lots of them from LiftVault. The one that I've been using a lot is a mix between the Candito 6 week plan and my own exercises. I follow this program because Candito gives me good progress for deadlifting when I implement only the deadlifting exercises as linear progression isn't suitable for me at my current stage. It's also a short program compared to other programs which I find easier to do as it's less boring. Instead of doing the optional lower body accessories I do my own back exercises. For the bench days I do my own regime of chest/shoulders/triceps as I find Candito not ideal for bench progress.

An example of my modified training plan is the first week of Candito 6 week. For the deadlift variations I typically do deficit deadlifts or RDLs depending on which part of the deadlift movement I'm weaker at. For bench press I change the focus from lifting heavier sets for strength with less reps to lighter sets focusing on explosiveness with more reps. I do arm exercises very frequently as you can get away with more volume for them but I tend to cut them out sometimes depending on my energy.  My training plan is a lot of volume sometimes and I typically spend up to 2 hrs in the gym (including pre and post workout stretches). For the later weeks of Candito when the intensity is higher I sometimes drop some of the accessories on deadlifting days. Depends on how I feel that day as a lot of my training is based on intuition.

Here is how week 1 of Candito 6 week + my changes would take place (keep in mind Candito's program changes every week if you look at the spreadsheet so this isn't for every week)

# Closing thoughts

Overall I'm very happy with my second year gym progress. I finally started making a lot of progress with bench and deadlift as I figured out how to do the exercises with better form. I feel a lot more confident than last year as I have much more experience with my body and how to continue when progress stalls. I also reached a level of body size I'm pretty happy with at 195 lbs though I'll likely continue bulking/cutting in the future at slower paces due to diminishing returns and more interest elsewhere.

As always I'm open to questions and thanks for all the continued support.",2024-07-08 06:20:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1dy1v7s/year_1_year_2_m25_60_183_lbs_217_lbs_195lbs/

This is progress from 2014 to present. The first picture was with already after 3 years of training. 

I have done almost every variation of training routines and splits over the years. Currently doing a 5 day split with upper/lower/arms with a focus on heavy compounds. Current lifts are B:385 D:530 S: 420. I have also learned to reduce the amount of volume and really focus on training hard every set, so generally I do around 12-15 sets per muscle per week. Rep ranges for compounds are low, while with accessory movements between 8-15 with Myo matching.

As for diet, I never really tracked anything other than protilein, which may be obvious given my bf%, but my goals was always to get as strong and big as I could, and then hopefully an eventual cut when I feel satisfied with the mass and strength.

As for supplements, I take creatine and protein. That's it.",2024-06-22 16:15:31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dlz83o
1bk18ou,gainit,39m 5'7 139 (63) ->154lbs (70 kg) (4 months) - Getting JACKED is this simple?!,"  
First of all, I just want to say thank you to everyone for sharing their knowledge and progress. Reading the stories here is what convinced me that absolutely anyone can get jacked.  
  
**Background**  
  
39m, ADHD, young family, demanding career, limited time.  
  
Like many here life and COVID got the best of me and I was living a very sedentary lifestyle with little to no exercise (a few dozen push ups and pull ups a week if I was lucky) for nearly three years.  
  
I had gone from being a [Ninja Warrior athlete](https://imgur.com/a/Z0HTPTA) to being a frustrated, unfit family man with a short fuse in the space of a few years.  
  
Early December 2023 was when I decided I needed to get my shit together for my mental health and for kicks, get jacked! I gained 7kg (15lbs) in under 4 months, the most I've gained by far in such a short space of time. Although I've been working out (on and off) for over 20 years, it only clicked recently that all I needed to do was be disciplined with my calorie and protein intake.  
  
**Progress**

Here is how I [look today](https://imgur.com/a/C9cpjqe). The goal is to hit about 72 kg (158 lbs), dial down the weight training and get back into martial arts.  
  
**Training**  
  
I train 3 days a week - push, pull, legs. Training comprises a combination of bodybuilding (slow negatives), powerlifting and calisthenics.I train with fairly high intensity which I believe has contributed to my progress.
  
**Diet/supplements**  
  
I don't track calories (probably should) but I basically add another meal to my standard 3 meals to ensure I get a sufficient calorie surplus. I'm disciplined with my 2 scoops of protein and 5g of creatine daily. I also take Tongkat Ali and Cistanche.  
  
**Final thoughts**  
  
I was never really a 'hard gainer', that is almost a myth, anyone can get big. I've just never been a big fan of eating, which is what has allowed me to stay lean even when being so inactive.  
  
If I knew getting jacked was as simple as tweaking my training and consuming more calories/protein - I would have done this 15 years ago!",2024-03-21 07:54:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1bk18ou/39m_57_139_63_154lbs_70_kg_4_months_getting/

1b0qznu,gainit,"Progess Post: 62kg -> 77kg -- 6'1""","Pics and a video: https://imgur.com/a/6RuXVSo (video is the ""After"" and is from earlier this month (Feb 2024) at 77kg)  

I was 62kg in September 2022. Got up to 76kg by July 2023, had a major operation on my chest (Nuss Procedure), dropped to 67kg by Sept 2023, worked my way back up to 77kg by Nov 2023, got sick and dropped to 70kg in Dec 2023, then worked my way up to 77kg again in Feb 2024.  Got sick again in Feb 2024, but didn't lose as much. Currently recovering and at 74kg. I have some heart and lung issues, which seem to flare up as I gain weight. I also get pain from 3 titanium bars in my chest.  
  
My ""natural weight"" if I just eat 3 times a day and don't really try hard is 69kg. If I'm lazy with meals I float around 65kg and was 62-65kg most of my life. I'm a programmer that can spend 18 hours at a desk without getting bothered by being hungry -- this was very useful for my startups, but not so much for my weight. Since 2022 I've been very good financially and have good teams running most things, so can focus more of my attention/energy on my weight instead of 100+ hour work weeks.  
  
Getting to 77kg the first time was the hardest. I was eating until I felt like puking every meal for the first 2-3 weeks. Getting there this last time was much easier. I think it's a combination of my stomach stretching and being used to the calories, and the surgery on my chest opening up more space for my stomach.
    
My chest is underdeveloped because my nerves were frozen with cryoablation for the surgery, and the sensation isn't fully back yet.
  
Height, Age, Sex: 186cm (6'1""), 33yo, male  
  
Starting & Ending Weight: 62kg->77kg  
  
Diet: 3000-3500 calories per day. I have a dietician and a chef - makes things easier. I track everything on MyFitnessPal and all my food is weighed.  
  
A typical lunch would be:  
* 400g boneless, skinless chicken breast, 20ml olive oil, 400g white rice, vegetables, half an avacado (1373 cal, 103g protein, 131g carbs, 46g fat).   
  
For breakfast I have:  
* 2 cups of overnight oats (with some nuts and other stuff in it) with 500ml of Almond milk (856 calories, 33g protein, 110g carbs, 25g fat).   
  
For a snack I have a homemade gainer shake with:  
* 120g oats, 2 scoops vegan protein powder (intolerant to animal milk and whey), 50g blueberries, 120g banana(785 cal, 39g protein, 158g carbs, 14.5g fat).  
  
A typical dinner would be:  
* 250g top sirloin steak, 400g white rice, vegetables, 90g potato, 150g avocado (1326 calories, 94g protein, 155g carbs, 38g fat)
    
Supplements: Creatine (5g/day), fish oil (4g/day), vitamin D (2000IU/day), CoQ10 (100mg/day), vitamin E, claritin (10mg/day), vitamin K(100mcg/day), methylated B vitamins, magnesium (144mg/day).  
  
Lifting Routine: PPL. I have a home gym with everything I need: powerrack, bench, dumbbell set (2.5->25kg), preacher curl, cable cross, leg press, leg extension, leg curl, seated calf raise, a bunch of plates, barbells, attachments, etc..  I used to track everything with the Strength app, but now I've been a bit lazy and my PT tracks my stuff anyway. I just got a PT in Jan 2024 -- it's not really necessary but she's nice to be around and makes me look forward to working out. Typical workouts:
  
Push:   
* 4x12 bench press (dumbbells), 3x12 incline benchpress (dumbbells), 3x12 cable decline flies, 3x12 shoulder press (dumbbells), 3x12 lateral raise (dumbbells), 3x12 tricep pushdowns (monkey rope)  
  
Pull:  
* 3x12 bent over barbell row, 3x12 cable row, 3x12 lat pulldown (or pullups if I'm feeling good - usually that's 3x6), 3x12 incline dumbbell curl, 3x12 barbell shrugs (I use straps for some stuff on pull day if my grips start to burn out too much - they're cheap and super useful)  
  
Legs:  
* 3x12 squats superset with some ab exercise, 3x12 leg curl superset with seated calf raises, 3x12 leg extension superset with 90s planks
  
My PT forces me to warmup before each exercise and stretches me after. I wouldn't do this if I didn't have a PT. Without a PT, I'd just warmup with the bar for a set of 8-12 then hit my working sets, and I wouldn't stretch after.  
  
Time Period Elapsed: ~17 months  
  
The chef, PT, and home gym are not necessary -- my first time hitting 77kg was without that. It's more about routine, commitment, and logging (MyFitnessPal for calories, Strong for workouts). I never really had a serious focus on gaining weight until ~18 months ago. I'd always wanted to gain weight, but never made any actual effort. As soon as I started counting calories, that's when I gained weight. At first I cheated a bit, didn't properly weight stuff, and would just assume a standard portion size of w.e. I was eating (lasasgna, club sandwich, chicken and rice, etc.). When I started weighing stuff, the weight gain became a lot more consistent. My dietician and chef now is more for my health rather than for gaining weight. I need to be very careful because of my heart issues.  
   
My biggest issue at the moment is chest pain (from the surgery/bars), shortness of breath / dyspnea (pretty bad asthma), and fatigue (not sure why). I'm working with a few doctors to try to sort all this out before going for my ultimate goal of 90kg. I want to hit that then drop down and maintain 85kg with <=15% body fat and able to comfortably run a 5k. The secret is to just be stubborn as hell and never quit. People don't fail, they just quit before they succeed. Keep going everyone!",2024-02-26 19:57:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1b0qznu/progess_post_62kg_77kg_61/

 I’ve noticed after turning 49 my body has changed for the worst. Muscle starting to go soft,muscle injuries, pains etc. so I am thinking about getting into a workout program again.  I am a tree worker (arborist) there are about 3 months work stops in my area from the cold weather holidays what have you. I’ve always been strong especially doing what I do for a living. I’m not ready to shut down at all nor am I ready to slow down so something’s got to give. I want to get my muscles back in shape like I was when I was in my 30’s. Working out has never bothered me but I don’t know what to take other than protein at my age or how much I need. I don’t want a bunch of size as that will make climbing harder so maybe getting what I’ve lost and toning the living hell out of it is what I’m after. I don’t know what to take if any while I do it quickly. I say take because a lot has changed since I used to work out when I was in my late teens working out and reading about the subject. I used  to take myozine (if that’s how you spell it?) and not worked good. Not great like steroids would have bit I’d like something new as a supplement to boost my body better than old technology supplements and/or just a daily diet. Basically I know I’m getting old but damnit but I want to fight it as hard as I can without giving up what I love about my work and hobbies ( more psychical labor type stuff I.E. construction, building hot rods, helping others with their harder stuff they can’t do alone sort of thing) 
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

In terms of workouts, I try and go 4 times a week, and I’ve kept my routine essentially the same since the beginning with regular progressive overload. When it comes to eating I just try to eat as much as I can no matter what (ie dirty bulking) while also trying to maximize protein. I’ve definitely left gains on the table not focusing on diet/supplements more, so that’s my next goal to fix with my upcoming (first) cut. 

Still hate going to the gym nearly every time, but love how I feel after. At this point it’s not motivation that keeps me going, but a developed habit. In my opinion a habit is what will keep you regular when the motivation goes away (and it will for most), but as long as you’re going regularly for whatever reason (even if not every workout is “perfect”), you’re doing it right.",2023-11-07 15:48:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/17px8y6/25_years_of_slow_and_steady_growth_57_140_160_lbs/
179nqkp,gainit,Newbie Trying to Bulk,"This past year I’ve been trying to get my lanky self into the gym, well last week it finally happened, and today i purchased myself a food scale and officially ended my frozen pizza and Uncrustable dirty bulk and purchased some chicken and rice like a true gym noob. I have a few questions regarding, diet, training, supplements and overall motivation. 

For starters here’s some basic info
24 Years old
5’11(6ft depending on who you ask me in front of)
Fluctuating 135-140 lbs
MODERATE intensity working out(3-4 Sets, 6-8 Reps, 4-5 Exercises) on 4 day split with one half hour cardio day
USED to be an athlete until the jazz cabbage found me in 2017
Above average metabolism, i say above because there are times i eat like a trash can and lose weight other times i gain 5 pounds for three days

My questions:

MyFitnessPal says my “gain one pound a week” Calorie goal is around 2580 a day, im currently shooting for 3500, is that overkill and over ambitious for a newbie?

How fast will i get sick of chicken and rice with sauce☠️

What supplements do i ACTUALLY need to seek results and maximize every aspect of this journey?(Currently Taking Pre-Kaged Elite, has Creatine, Beta Alanine, and Citrulline(along with a metric ton of caffeine))

What kind of training schedule will maximize results for a newbie that’s honestly pretty weak

How do people stay so focused and commit to this lifestyle even on their worst days, does it get to a point where this becomes your escape?

I hate to be this guy but obviously being small in a gym full of absolute units is a little upsetting, how long until i see a noticeable change and actually know what I’m doing?

Training partner yes or no? 

How long have you been lifting and what makes you go back every day?

If you’ve made it this far thank you for your time and your input is much obliged, wish me luck on this as I’ve failed many times trying to get myself into the gym and really make this life change.",2023-10-17 02:24:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/179nqkp/newbie_trying_to_bulk/

13icj4p,gainit,"Progress and Program Review: Jamie Lewis' Updated ""Feast, Famine and Ferocity"" Program Has Me The Strongest & Most Jacked Ever","**INTRO**

If you’re not a fan of Jamie Lewis, originally of “Chaos and Pain” and now “Plague of Strength”, you’re not going to enjoy this piece, but I’m going to lead by saying Jamie has flat out changed my life all for the positive and I owe him a TON, and the least I can do is sing his praise, positively review his material and try to get others to buy from and support him.  So that’s what I’m going to do here.


Get the program here

https://plagueofstrength.com/the-feast-famine-and-ferocity-diet-is-now-updated-and-available-as-an-e-book/

I'm going to write this backwards, starting with the results, going into the program reviews, then the background.  I figure that's really what's important.

---

**STARTING WITH RESULTS**

* It’s so rare I do photos, [so appreciate this](https://i.imgur.com/uwkBgoj.png).  This isn’t 6 weeks purely on FFF, but the end of Super Squats and the final week of “Feast”, so about 9 weeks of change.  



* As far as lift results go, I genuinely hate detailing this stuff, since my training is so wild and difficult to track.  I’m gonna just shutgun some stuff here, but ultimately: I’m the strongest I’ve been in a LONG time while also the leanest.

*  From week 1 to week 4 of Feast, I went from only being able to do 3 rounds of EMOM 200lb log clean and press for doubles to getting through a full 8 rounds of it.

*  From 4 triples of SSB squats w/405 in the first week of Famine to 6 triples of 415 in the third week of Feast

*  4x2x321 axle bench in the first week of Famine, 10x2x301 in week 3 of Feast (with 1 minute rests vs 2+)

* But honestly, stuff like [this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbtDWEWJ8wA) is really what I find most impressive as far as results.  That’s an 11+4+3x405+chain mat pull, but the context is: I had been walking around the zoo for 6 hours that day, having only had a Metabolic Drive shake for lunch and then coming home from a solid [carnivore feast](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/e/1/d/e1d5ffdf73834fc67487531f81d2d921476cc598.jpeg), and I had 5 minutes before we were going to turn right around and walk the dog (get in my 2 miles).  I threw on some shorts I had on the laundry, warmed up with ONE rep of 155+chains, and then pulled that.  All the daily activity, new stuff I’ve been exposed to, good eating, etc etc has me fully healed and ready to move and act when needed.  I’ve genuinely just never felt more capable and dangerous.

**PROGRAM REVIEW**

*THE PROGRAMS IN GENERAL*

* I’m drawn to Jamie’s programming primarily because he doesn’t rely much on percentages and he encourages experimentation.  His programming is far more ideas and structures than an actual set routine, and the focus is on effort.  What was even more awesome about both Feast and Famine was that Jamie offers a 3-4 day variant and a 5-6 day variant of both programs, so there’s a LOT of flexibility there.  Those 3-4 day variants are LOADED to make it all work out, so, amazingly, I found myself drawn to the 5-6 day variants instead.  Since I get up early to train, I’m able to train 5 days a week without issue and didn’t need to cut down to 3-4 days, despite the fact I’ve written about the value of lifting weights 3-4 days a week to put on size.  It helps that, at this point in my training, putting on size wasn’t the concern: I had Super Squats for that.  For now, the goal was simply to experience the training and see what happened.

**AWESOME ELEMENTS OF FAMINE AND FEAST PROGRAMS**


* Both programs feature a day Jamie refers to as “Dealer’s Choice”, which is as it sounds: do what you want.  For Famine, it’s up to 90 minutes.  For Feast, there’s no set time and Jamie even permits you to make it a day off if needed (which, despite all the increased cals, you may still need: I’ll detail that more later).  Either way is brilliant, and I think EVERY program needs this.  Trainees are stupid.  I’m including myself in there.  Trainees will ALWAYS sneak stupid crap into a program.  Pet lifts (curls, of course), stupid human tricks and gimmicks, “weak areas”, etc.   Trainees will inevitably wreck a program because they’ll change it up too much to fit in all this extra stuff that they end up reducing the effectiveness or flat our violating the intent, turning accumulation into intensification or GPP.  By having ONE day of the program where you just do what you want, you can get it all out of your system and then get back on program.  It’s the “cheat meal” of training.  During Famine, I’d throw in ALL that extra stuff I was doing before: Poundstone curls, lateral raise deathsets, belt squats, Kroc Rows, mat pull ROM progression, etc.  During Feast, my schedule was nuttier, so I often would just continue the ROM progression cycle and, if I had time, throw in some conditioning work and call it good.  But in both cases: my program compliance was MUCH stronger compared to programs I’d run in the past.

* Daily physical requirements/daily work.  Prior to starting up the program, I had my own daily work, which was: 50 chins, 50 dips, 50 pull aparts, 40 reverse hypers, 30 GHRs, 20 standing ab wheels, and often some neck work.  I’d get this done no matter what.  Jamie prescribes a daily 2 mile walk, outside, no matter what, along with 300 squats and 300 push ups.  I balked when I first saw that…and, in turn, loved that I had a new challenge in front of me.  And yeah: the first 2 days, I was SORE AS HELL, but upon adapting, I saw some AMAZING results.  The push ups and squats have honestly been transformative, as I’m seeing veins all over my quads and shoulders, but honestly, that daily 2 mile walk outside has probably been one of the most positive things I’ve ever done for myself.  It’s a chance to clear my head, get in some vitamin D, and bring back some health into my life.  Having it be a daily requirement and forcing myself to come up with ways to fit the walk into my day has been awesome, and my dog is appreciating all the time outside as well, and it’s gotten me to break out my weight vest again to add in even more resistance opportunities.  And that 2 mile walk has become a mere minimum, as I find myself becoming “activity seeking”, and will often get in 2 miles unweighted walking and then an extra 1-2 miles with a weight vest on as well. 

* On the daily work, Jamie is adamant that “this is not part of your workout-it is part of being a human being”.  I appreciate the sentiment there.  Being able to move your body through space is huge.  That said, I was big on making the push ups and squats INTO a workout when possible.  Toward the end, my go to was to use Tabata intervals of 20 seconds on/10 seconds off and do squats during the 20 second and push ups during the 10.  I’d settle on 20 squats per round and 15 push ups, getting me 300 squats in 15 rounds, and then I’d do the remaining push ups as fast as possible.  Keeping to those Tabata intervals makes this a pretty solid conditioning hit and only takes about 9 minutes to knock out.  Typically, I’d do this after the workout on weekdays, and on weekends I took to accomplishing it literally as soon as my feet would hit the floor in the morning.  I HATE working out, still do, and getting this done ASAP was pretty big for me.  Sometimes, though, I’d get cute and start incorporating push ups and squats into a larger conditioning paradigm, like in a circuit with swings, or GHRs, or chins, etc.  But, either way, I always met these goals.

**DEVIATIONS I MADE TO BOTH PROGRAMS**

* Jamie encourages experimentation, so game on.

* Jamie slots that “Dealer’s choice” toward the middle of the week with both programs, but for my work schedule it worked better to put it on Fridays/Weekends.  In the case of Famine, his middle of the week workout is either a day off or a 30 minute bodyweight conditioning circuit, which fit MUCH better with my weekend schedule, so putting that on Sat/Sun and Dealer’s choice on Friday allowed me to get in a 60+ minute dealer’s choice workout, which got in a lot of work.  In the case of Feast, there are 5 loaded days of training that worked much better for M-F for me, and then dealer’s choice on weekends allowed me to get anywhere from a 4-60 minute workout, depending on what my choice was as the dealer.  

* I made sure to run a full week of both programs exactly as written out, to include rest times, exercise order, etc.  In doing so, many of my workouts ran into the 80+ minute mark, which became a bit cumbersome with my schedule, but I wanted to understand how the training “felt” before I mucked with it.  Once I had that baseline established, I broke out the giant sets, short rest times, etc: all those tricks I’ve used in the past to get in more volume in less time.  I still made sure to bring the intensity, but wherever I could find logical pairings and groupings, I’d throw them in.  The 5xAMRAP hanging leg raises that happen EVERY training day are a quick kill, and much of the arm work could work in with other stuff.  Sometimes, though, it’d become something incredibly brutal, like bouncing between heavy shrugs and squats during Feast (more on that later).

* You’ll note I did NOT write about additional conditioning work, extra workouts, etc etc.  Jamie really “fixed” my compulsion here.  I’d be done with the training…and I’d trained “enough”.  This was really pretty huge for me.

*”FAMINE” SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS/DEVIATIONS*

* With Jamie’s permission, I took full workout footage of all my training sessions of Famine AND Feast, so I’ll post those if you want to see the whole thing in action.

* [Famine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VnicWt6NqU&list=PLfcuGAffLlSdfWeHmA6BsUctSrdGdaObB&pp=iAQB)

* [Feast: Playlist isn't fully updated, but the videos are all on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k8jkk6VLec&list=PLfcuGAffLlSf-y7VAbGZ3TVKoE1T5OycC&pp=iAQB)

* I made a few deviations from the programming, more out of equipment limitations.  I don’t have a leg extension or leg curl machine.  For extensions, I could use my reverse hyper, sit on top of it, hook my feet through the straps and do extensions.  That worked well.  Turning around to do curls that way?  Not as great.   I stuck with it through Famine, since it’s only 2 weeks, before eventually just going with GHRs during Feast, and when I return to Famine, that’s where I’ll go.

* My cable set up is pretty janky, so for cable rows I went with landmine t-bar rows instead.  I also don’t have a machine shoulder press, but I rigged up a VERY awesome Viking press set-up with bands that was clutch (you’ll see it on the video).

* Strongman implements regularly featured, because they’re awesome.  I also was making extensive use of the SSB, because I was still pretty broken from Super Squats.

* I didn’t follow the diet 100%, but I met the spirit of it.  LOTS of caffeine, shakes made up the majority of my nutrition, calories were low.  I trained fasted as well.  

*”FEAST” SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS/DEVIATIONS*

* I underwent a MAJOR nutritional pivot during Feast, and it’s been one of the most positive things I’ve done for myself in a long time.  I absolutely didn’t meet Jamie’s prescription as far as calories goes, primarily because I’m not going to count calories.  In addition, the shakes were still regular features because they went a long way toward streamlining my life.  HOWEVER, for my solid meals: I went carnivore.  I’d been wanting to try out a carnivore diet for a few years now, after listening first to Shawn Baker and then Paul Saladino and a few other carnivore influencers talk to the approach (and constantly hearing Mark Bell beat the drum for it).  This also matches up a bit more directly with how Jamie laid out the “Apex Predator Diet”, as the solid meals were all meat.  I honestly just wasn’t in a good place psychologically to undertake it, but this protocol was VERY freeing in that regard, so I went full steam ahead…and it’s been amazing.  I’ll probably just have to make it another blog post (a continuation of the overhaul series), but I’m only eating meat, eggs and cheese/dairy, and I attribute that to some of the AMAZING results I’ve gotten (will sum that up at the end).  I still opt for high quality sources (grassfed beef/dairy when possible, pasture raise eggs, etc), and I’m still using supplements to fill in gaps (Superfood, Flameout, several others), but the Feast has been a carnivore Feast.  Conan approved!  

* After the first week of Anderson squats, I used a larger ROM and started using bands.  That was the right call.  My hip and knee were STILL messed up from Super Squats, and heavy loading was killing them.  The bands allowed me to keep the bar weight low, but the intensity was THROUGH THE ROOF.  Try breaking a dead weight off of chains when it’s banded in place.  It takes EFFORT!  And you can NOT quit once you start. 

* Rather than do 5x10-15 leg curls, I did GHRs.  But along with that, I did them with my push ups and squats, turning it into a circuit workout.  I worked up to a final workout of 15 rounds of 15 GHRs, 20 squats, 15 push ups, then got in the remaining 75 push ups to get my 300, then went for a max set of GHRs.  It was a LOT of GHRs. 

* For benching, week 1 was dead bench, week 2 was dead bench against bands, week 3 was touch and go axle bench, week 4 was pause axle bench with chains.  I ultimately just needed gimmicks to get me through it, but I was getting stronger.

* For pressing, I set out with a goal to get all 8 sets done in 8 minutes, using an EMOM style, so I never increased the weight on it.  Different ways to progress.

* For the squats and shrugs day, I rotated between SSB front squats and SSB squats, primarily because, with a deathset at the end, it was good to use the SSB.  SSB front squats are honestly a hidden gem of a movement that I rediscovered, and I’ll need to include it more in the future.  For the shrugs, I did my best to set it up like a hip and thigh lift, but on one set in particularly I REALLY crunched my left quad and had to eventually settle on trap bar shrugs for the final week.  And I think that’s going to be a more permanent solution.  It just works better.

* On that same day, instead of the leg curl work, I would do GHRs while holding a kettlebell in a goblet squat position.  Honestly: this is an AMAZING hamstring workout.  I made my final one particularly tough by doing sets of 3 every 20 seconds, getting in 9 sets total, then the 2 AMRAPS, then dying.

* For pulls, I did a whole bunch of crazy crap, but it always included the trap bar.  High handle one week, ox lift one week (torqued my knee and wanted to keep loading light on the knee), high handle again but with short rests, low handle.  I stuck with trap bar because my “Dealer’s Choice” was deadlift bar ROM pull progression (I started the cycle on Famine and continued it through Feast, which was like a billion IQ move on my part) and I didn’t need to pull heavy with a strap bar twice in a week.  This also made the rows awesome, as I went with trap bar rows, which are what I’ll bring into Famine.  They’re an awesome movement.

* [Eating a 5lb cheeseburger in 30 minutes]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC1mlgTuxZY)

* I apologize if this seems gratitious, but I just cannot emphasize enough how freeing and ridiculous it is to be able to just eat and eat and eat and see nothing but results.  The protocol is self-perpetuating: as you see yourself transform, you just keep leaning into it.


**BACKGROUND**

*Ancient History Stuff*

* I am 37 years old, 5’9, 182.3lbs as of my writing this, have been lifting weights since I was 14, competed in powerlifting and strongman since 2010, have a background in martial arts/wrestling, have pulled 601, squatted 502 and benched 342 in a meet, lifted more in the gym, and done lots of nutty things in my time.

*More Relevant Background* 

* Prior to starting up Jamie’s diet and program, I had just finished up Super Squats, also a great program for different reasons.  This was an epic run of it, culminating in me squatting 405 for 20 reps and getting fairly jacked…and also just absolutely destroying my body in the process.  If you're curious about my experience contracting RSV and tearing my tricep in the first run and all the elbow/knee/hip pain I had in the second run, here are my two write ups

https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/znfw1m/program_review_super_squats_the_what_would_bruce/

https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/11go5su/program_review_super_squats_3_the_revenge/

* Clearly, a change was needed.

* I fell back to my old standby of reading “5/3/1 Forever” and ran the 5/3/1 Krypteia base phase, using front squats and SSB squats liberally as a means to heal my elbow, but there was more that needed doing.

**CHANGE 1: THE APEX PREDATOR DIET**

* Folks, this write up is HUGE, so I'm gonna cliff notes this part, but I intend to post the fully fleshed out review in my blog over the next few weeks, so if you DO want the nitty gritty, feel free to head over there.  A lot of this can be found in the ""complete overhaul"" write ups.

* I’d read about the Apex Predator Diet before, in Jamie’s “Issuance of Insanity”. Previously, I had written them both off due to the extensive use of protein shakes, but when I considered how much I was spending on solid foods at this point to support myself, I realized a shake based diet would honestly be pretty economical.    I abided by Jamie’s recommendation for lean trainees to have 2 lunch time solid meals a week, since I got to meet my wife on those days for lunch, and my weekends were more solid food based, since that was time I got to spend with my family and I wasn’t going to be drinking shakes while we were out having meals together.  I still needed that social healing.  But, effectively, any time I could have a shake instead of a meal, I went with a shake.

**OUTCOME OF CHANGE #1** 

* I’ve written about this in my blog already as part of my “complete overhaul” series, but to summarize: this change in and of itself was life-changing.  I got back SO much of my life and my time with my family by switching the majority of my meals to shakes.  The two biggest offenders were my breakfasts and my pre-bed meals, of which I’ve logged about before, but they were massive and time consuming.  Ultimately, I needed “permission” to stop eating like that, and having the recommendation of someone like Jamie went a long way.  And after jumping straight in, I found out that I could still train just as hard and be just as strong even without the insane morning and nightly rituals.  

* As this change only lasted the course of the Krypteia base phase and deload, it was only 4 weeks of living this way.  After Super Squats, I still had some fluff to lose, and 4 weeks of dieting really isn’t much in the grand scheme of things, so I was seeing SOME positive physique changes but nothing significant…and then I started following one of Jamie’s programs and things REALLY got interesting.

**CHANGE 2: “FEAST, FAMINE AND FEROCITY”**

* It was practically kismet when Jamie released the Feast, Famine and Ferocity e-book, itself a re-packaging and update of an article series he’s previously released on his website.  I’ll do a review of the book package itself sometime in the future, but a quick summary is it’s a 50 page e-book where half of it is dedicated to the aforementioned program series of “Famine” and “Feast” while the other half is a republishing of his Bruce Randall article.  The later article IS a fantastic read, and I’d read it many times beforehand, but it’s worth appreciating that it’s really more a 30 page e-book in this regard.  That said, much like I wrote about in my review of Ben Pollack’s “Think Big”, a short e-book where every page is gold is SO much more valuable than 300 pages of fluff, and Jamie’s book definitely achieves that standard.

* I genuinely had no intention of changing programs when I bought the book: I just am such a fan of Jamie that when he sells stuff I buy it so I can give him support.  However, upon reading it, I new my fate was sealed, similarly to the first time I read “Super Squats” and was all keyed up to begin my 6 weeks on that program once the book was done.  The primary draw was the fact that the “Famine” diet was VERY similar to the Apex Predator modification I was currently following.  The primary difference is that Famine has NO solid meals whatsoever: all shakes.  I wasn’t about to do THAT, but I did permit myself a few “all shakes” days in the 2 weeks that I followed the program, primarily because my schedule would permit for that…which meant, specifically, my wife would be out of town and I wouldn’t be missing any meals with her.  If she’s around, I’m not going to skip a meal with her to have a shake.  Sorry: priorities.

* I’ll then go on to say that, when I finished the entire book, I thought “Yeah, Famine fits, but this diet has been going so well that I’m not gonna do ‘Feast’.  I’ll do Famine and then something else”.

* Yeah: that fell quickly to the wayside.  Jamie’s programming was so solid that I couldn’t wait to see it all the way through.  So with that, allow me to discuss both programs in a broad scale before going on to discuss each in detail.


----

**CONCLUSION**


* Folks, I could legit talk about this protocol any Jamie’s intervention into my life for a LONG time.  It’s honestly hard to cut myself off here (my current write up is 10 pages in length, but I’m trying to chop it down to make it readable for you).  Please ask questions, but, in general: this has become my favorite protocol in 23 years of training.  Everyone needs to run it.  Everyone needs to try Apex Predator.  Everyone needs to buy stuff from Jamie.  Call me a shill: I don’t care.  This has been life changing.",2023-05-15 16:13:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/13icj4p/progress_and_program_review_jamie_lewis_updated/

**Stats**

Starting weight: 164 lbs

Ending weight: 183 lbs

Age: 24-25 years old

Height: 6'0

Have been skinny mostly and sometimes fat for my whole life, so I decided to dedicate a year to getting as swole as possible for fun and I wanted to share my results. I did a slow lean bulk from 164 lbs to 195 lbs from May 2022 to March 2023 (10 months) with the goal of gaining 0.5 lbs per week, then cut to 183 lbs (2 months) with the goal of losing 1 lbs per week. I did work out inconsistently before I started but started taking diet and training seriously for the past year. In case you want to know what I looked like 2 and 3 years ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/qqhle7/m2360\_200lbs\_160lbs\_40lbs\_nov\_2020\_nov\_2021\_face/](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/qqhle7/m2360_200lbs_160lbs_40lbs_nov_2020_nov_2021_face/)

# Diet

For diet I ate the exact same thing everyday 90% of the time. I figured that way I don't have to count macros as long as I'm 300 calories above my TDEE when bulking and 500 calories below my TDEE when cutting. I entered my food in MyFitnessPal to get the calories and macros. I find that measuring myself with a scale everyday around the same time also helps a lot with tracking and I used a Renpho scale and the corresponding app. Weight fluctuates often and it's good if my average weight follows the trajectory I set out on a weekly basis rather than a daily basis. I took only creatine, protein powder, and preworkout as supplements.

TDEE: 2500-2700 calculated here: 

Note: I added more calories to my TDEE (originally 2100-2300) because I went to the gym 4-6 times a week and walked quite a bit. Adding the extra calories allowed me to keep good progress for gaining 0.5 lbs per week from my experience.

# Workout

I did a mix of 1/4 powerlifting and 3/4 bodybuilding training as I wanted both strength and aesthetics but mostly aesthetics. I started off with a compound movements (squat/bench/deadlift/OHP) and supplemented with dumbbell and isolation exercises afterwards. I also hit arms 4x a week at the end of my chest and back workouts (2x tricep and 2x bicep) because my arms are a weak point of my physique. The workout plans I followed in order are nSuns (5 days) for 8 months, Candito for 2 months and a modified version of GZCL for the last 2 months and is what I currently do. The modified routine is as follows.

**Sun - Chest/Back**

* Chest 
   * Incline DB press (3x8-10)
   * Flat DB press (3x8-10)
   * Single Arm Cable Chest Fly (3x12)
* Back
   * Barbell Row (3x10)
   * Lat pulldown (3x12) 
   * Single Arm Lat pulldown (3x12)
* Biceps 
   * Standing Barbell Curls (3x12 )
   * Preacher Curls (3x12)

**Mon - Legs**

* GZCL Squat
* GZCL SLDL
* Leg Press (3x10)
* Bulgarian Split Squats (3x10)

**Tues - Shoulders/Chest**

* Shoulders
   * Shoulder Dumbell Press (3x10)
   * Lat raise (3x15)
   * Cable Rear Delt Flys (3x12)
* Chest 
   * Flat DB press (3x10)
   * Incline DB press (3x8-10)
   * Single Arm Cable Fly (3x12)
* Triceps (RPE 7)
   * Cable Pushdown (3x12)
   * Skullcrushers (3x12)

**Thurs - Back**

* Back
   * GZCL DL
   * Lat pulldown (3x12)
   * Single Arm Lat Pulldown (3x12)
   * Cable Row (3x8-10)
   * Single Arm Cable row (3x12)
* Biceps
   * Spider Curls (3x12)
   * Hammer Curls (3x12)

**Fri - Chest/Shoulders**

* Chest
   * Flat DB press (3x8-10)
   * Incline DB press (3x8-10)
   * Single Arm Cable Fly (3x12)
* Shoulders
   * Shoulder Dumbell Press (3x10)
   * Lat raise (3x15)
   * Cable Rear Delt Flys 40 lbs (3x12)
* Triceps 
   * Cable Pushdown (3x12)
   * Skull crushers (3x12)

I mainly follow this routine to target specific muscles. For example, my legs are the most dominant part of my body and my shoulders are the least dominant, so I allocate more or less workouts accordingly. 

**PRs**

Bench: 135 lbs x 5 -> 200 lbs x 2 (205 lbs x 1 estimated 1 RM) 

Squat: 185 lbs x 3 -> 385 lbs x 1

Deadlift: 225 lbs x 3 -> 455 lbs x 3  (475 lbs x 1 estimated 1 RM)

Note: I haven't benched in months so my PR is quite old as I stick to dumbbells these days, so I may be able to do more. Still I am quite disappointed with my bench progress because I was really hoping for 2 plates but I maybe I'm just a weak bencher :( .  I am quite happy with squat and deadlift numbers though. I use knee sleeves + belt for squat and straps + belt for deadlift.

# Training:

I’m running Jeff Nippards Upper/Lower fundamentals. A quite modified version but it’s still basically this program at its core. Therefore, I go to the gym 4 times a week and on two of my off days I’m doing cardio in the form of running. With running I go easy, so just about half an hour or 5km/3 miles at the moment.

# Diet:

Fairly healthy vegetarian diet. I’m not eating 100% clean but I want to keep it mostly clean since for me personally it is not worth it to eat too much junk just to gain some mass. The way I gained mass for the first two months was pretty much just adding a protein shake with peanut butter on top of my regular diet. I would adjust the amount of peanut butter to increase the number of calories if I wasn’t gaining anymore on a week to week basis. This works pretty well until you get sick of it. Now I just eat either four meals or do calorie dense snacking with nuts (or nuts and dried berry mixes) and keep the shake but with protein powder only. I also always drink 100% fruit juice with my meals and sometimes milk.

# Supplements:

I only use protein powder since I would struggle to get enough protein just from food. I also started taking creatin halfway through and it made quite a noticeable difference in my performance. Since natural creating is mostly found in meat, maybe I actually did not have enough in my diet.

# Things I’ve learned/Tips:

&#x200B;

* In the beginning, just add a protein shake with peanut butter to your diet. The additional 400 cals or so should be enough for a noticeable weight gain after some time
* For your meals, try adding MSG to food. It makes it a lot tastier and therefore makes it easier to eat larger quantities
* When struggling to get more calories in, add liquid calories like (100% fruit) juice after meals or milk
* Maybe it takes a couple of tries to find the program or the gaining method that works for you, so don’t be discouraged if it doesn’t work first try!",2023-04-03 15:49:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/12aofxk/59kg130lbs_to_66kg1455lbs_in_about_34_months/

Lifted heavily late 2019 into summer 2020, fell out of the habit and lifted/bulked sporadically in the next few years, been lifting consistently 5x a week since January this year where I weighed 150lbs. Began the journey weighing 136lbs, current weighing around 166-167. Battled stomach problems. I have been bulking without consuming any dairy or gluten.

Blessed with great body fat genetics, I do not eat super clean, but just happen to maintain low body fat naturally, thus a lot of my gains have been lean muscle mass.

3,150 calories a day minimum (likely only 2-3 days since Jan 1st this was not achieved).

Current lifts:

Squatting 225 for 5x5

Bench press 135x8

Deadlift 275lbs

Lifts when I first began my journey:

Squatting 65lbs 5x5

Bench Press 70lbs 5x5

Deadlift 80lbs 5x5

(likely lower than I could've actually lifted but since I was new I focused on form and kept weight low).

Diet consists of lots of nuts, and fatty foods (80/20 ground beef, olive oil on many foods).

107dp6y,gainit,[Progress] 531 BBS Program review: Three months of doing it wrong and still getting results,"I’ve never seen anyone on reddit touch on the BBS variation of Jim’s programs. I’ve stumbled upon this little gem some time ago and I’ve wanted to check how it compares against Boring But Big and Building the Monolith. I mean, I’ve never seen it mentioned, was it because there was something wrong with the program itself?

All I can say is this program works. I’ve never done so many sets at those weight levels and to my surprise, in the final weeks, my form improved instead of getting worse, despite having to continuously perform at 85% for 10 sets. This training definitely sounds scarier than it actually is and it gets you used to heavy weight. Fatigue is definitely a thing with this program and it will teach you to handle big loads while tired. You’ll come to see that you’re stronger than you think. 

For this program, I recommend doing breathing squats and touch-and-go deadlifts whenever possible. Good form should always take priority - I think there is a real chance of injury with those weights if it’s compromised. For press, I’ve been starting my sets off the floor until the weight got heavy and influenced my form. 

https://archive.ph/8nWL4


Short summary: 

Instead of 5x10, you do 10 sets 5 reps each, starting at 70% and changing the weight by 5% each three weeks, so that during the final 3 week cycle, you are performing 10x5 at 85% of your TM. Sounds easy enough, right?

Sets – 10 Reps – 5
Weeks 1-3 – 70%
Weeks 4-6 – 75%
Weeks 7 – Deload (choose the deload you want to do, no BBS training)
Weeks 8-10 – 80%
Weeks 11-13 – 85%


RESULTS: 

Weight 84-ish kg ->86-ish, male

PRs before the program
Squat: 130kg
Bench: 110 kg
Deadlift: 160kg
Press: 62 kg

I usually don’t test my maxes, so just for context, let me give you the working sets I’ve had to do on my final three week cycle

10 sets of reps 5:
Squat: 107.5 kg
Bench: 90 kg
Deadlift: 130kg
Press: 47.5 kg

No injuries to speak of, although I used a belt on the 80% and 85% weeks for squats and deadlifts - highly recommended. Whether I’ve gotten bigger or not, it’s hard for me to say, I’m having a hard time being objective. I’ve definitely gotten more confident under heavy weight and honestly, it’s all that matters to me.


CHANGES:
I’ve made some changes to the original program. I’ve changed the assistance work to better fit my goals and schedule. I’ve run this program for all my 4 lifts, even though the program says it’s not recommended.

During the 80% and 85% week, I’ve extended my rest periods to focus on my form and make sure I don’t break anything. Honestly, I could probably be resting less.

Assistance work: taken directly from BBB, meaning:

Squat day: 50 dips, 50 chin ups
Bench day: Ab work and 5x10 barbell rows
Deadlift: 50+ dips (I’ll admit I’ve skipped face pulls more often than not)
Press: Ab work and 5x10 barbell rows


DIET & SUPPLEMENTS:
I’ve stopped taking anything but protein powder for convenience. I think they contribute very little for their price. 

That being said, my diet could be better. I eat like an adult 80% of the time, rest is pizzas and chips. I’m getting better at making guilt-free snacks (homemade protein bars are killer), but most of my diet is just piles of veggies, meat and an enormous amount of eggs.

My ideal daily eating routine:

8 scrambled eggs with some ham and greens
Handmade protein snacks or PB based cake OR pastries. I really should cut down on pastries.
400-ish g of meat with a lot of pasta (around 200g a day) and veggies, or 300-400g of fish with tons of potato-based homemade fries. Pizza  and often chips on the weekends

Sometimes life would get in the way and my meals would stretch towards the next day. All in all, I could be eating more, just like I could train harder.



TAKEAWAYS:
With extended rest periods, this program will take a lot of time. While BBB can usually be done around 50 mins, I’ve been finishing my sessions half an hour later than usual. With some practice and appropriate T M, the rest times could probably be cut down to more acceptable levels.

My conditioning needs to be improved. I love running, but HIIT is where I definitely lack and it shows under heavy pressure. I’ve gotten light headed during squats and deadlifts more times than I care to admit.

Training Max needs to be conservative to take full advantage of the volume work. Don’t worry if the first three weeks feel easy - that will change as the time goes on.

My recovery often sucked. I couldn’t bring myself to do a proper bulk and I could definitely eat more. I’ve also made no sacrifices in regards to my social life, and I’ve had to recuperate from a difficult weekend once a month. What I’m saying, the results could be even better, had I shown some more discipline.",2023-01-09 12:53:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/107dp6y/progress_531_bbs_program_review_three_months_of/
101mdn7,gainit,4 Year Natural Transformation,"[progress pictures](https://imgur.com/a/tyKhDB9)

Got inspired by some recent posts and decided to share my own. (I tried to post this a month ago, but I didn’t have enough karma 😭 but I guess this is perfect timing for some new year’s motivation now.) I was always the smallest kid I knew and at one point I was 1 percentile in weight meaning that 99% of boys my age were heavier than me. I struggled with gaining any type of weight and being a slow and picky eater who woke up too late for breakfast didn’t help. Also, until college, I was mostly eating whatever Mom decided to cook, but with her being a meat hater and a vegetable lover, I was always at a protein deficit and calorie deficit in general unless I supplemented it with my own extra meals. The last picture was taken during college which is when the gains really started to happen as I was forced to feed myself, so I would do my best to fit as many calories and protein in everyday. This was not easy as larger meals took time to prep and I would have a stomach ache after every meal from trying to force food down my throat long after I was full. But yeah, bottom line like everyone else has already said is “JUST EAT!”

Biggest tips/ lessons that I’ve learned:
- Stay consistent, change doesn’t happen overnight

- Take baby steps, (don’t try to increase your caloric intake by 1000 calories in 1 day)

- Doing a little bit of something is always better than doing nothing, (if you don’t feel like cooking or working out, just make something small or cut the workout a bit short)

- Just show up (even if you don’t feel like going to the gym, if you just show up and plan to stay for 5 minutes (it will inevitably be longer) then you are creating the habit of showing up which is the most important aspect to making progress in anything 

- Don’t compare yourself to others. Be inspired by others, but don’t tear yourself apart because you don’t look like them. You’re you and you have your own problems, your own experiences, you’re own time. It doesn’t matter what they have. Just focus on yourself because you’re the only one who can change you.

- Take creatine! As far as I know creatine is a cheat code and there are no negative side effects that have been proven to be directly related to it. [Click to learn about creatine.](https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/)

- Get good at eating!! I suck at eating and I’m still trying to get better, but literally just get good at eating. I didn’t know you could be bad at eating, but trust me, I am BAD at eating. Focus on chewing the food, don’t watch TV or videos on your phone, and don’t talk to people while eating. Just focus on taking bite after bite and don’t stop.

- Don’t be afraid to push yourself in the gym. If you feel like you can go a bit heavier, just go for it. Don’t injure yourself, but you know you’re body best, so if it feels good you’ll probably be fine. If you fail, then you fail. Who cares? Just keep working and you’ll get stronger.

- Have fun with it. Try to enjoy the process. Obviously it’s not easy, but making it fun will help a lot. For me, music helps a lot. Listening to music while cooking helps me get in the zone and be super efficient and also definitely make a gym playlist with a lot of hype songs, that helps me a lot. Also, if the gym gets boring, try calisthenics. It’s super fun and challenging. 


Okay thats it for me! Hope this helps somebody. Keep grinding and feel free to DM me if you have any questions. Happy New Year’s and go reach those goals!",2023-01-02 20:14:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/101mdn7/4_year_natural_transformation/
zqom8h,gainit,2 years progress 160 lbs - 200 lbs,"6'2 29m

I started out on this site and got a lot of info on how to get down the calories I need every day. Blending is the way to go. Thank you.

I was always skinny and only ate a lot in bursts. Was never really hungry, but gaining was the only way I could feel confident about myself. I honestly never thought I'd be able to do it for so long.

I started out taking supplements like protein powder and creatine. My strength increased massively, but it all faded away when I cut the supps out of my diet last year. I'm now stronger than I was but without the extra water weight from the supplements.

My diet isn't spectacular, but I'm eating around 2500 calories a day. Eggs, chicken, tuna wraps, beef, rice, broccoli, fruit smoothies, cereal, and various snacks.

I always thought you had to go from a bulking phase to a cutting phase, but slowly gaining over time was just as good for me. Of course, I'm still not deadlifting 600 lbs, so there's that.

1mth11g,loseit,Iron deficiency anaemia,"I’ve been trying to lose weight (not a lot, around 5-10kg). I was following a calorie deficit, hoping to lose it that way alone but unfortunately I’m so sedentary (office job and not a gym goer) I can’t actually consume less calories and still be able to function.

So, I decided I need to incorporate fitness for it to be healthy and achievable. Problem is, every time I try to exercise I get incredibly drained and tired and I ache for days, sometimes a week afterwards, even though I don’t do much. Even a 1 minute jog winds me so much I can hardly breathe.

I got a blood test and turns out my ferritin level is incredibly low (7) and so is my iron. No wonder I was so depressed not getting any energy from my diet and on top of that, being extremely anaemic.

Are there any low impact exercises I can do to help weight loss while I’m in this condition? I’m on supplements now but it may take months to return to normal. I’m going to ask my doctor about an iron infusion because that would speed things up.

1msiruj,loseit,Ideas for iron and protein deficiency?,"I’ve been using the MFP app for about a month now to track my food and it’s become a huge part of planning my day. Only recently I’ve been really paying attention to the nutrition section.

It looks like my iron levels are very low daily. I’ve felt like I’ve probably been iron deficient for most of my life now but I’ve never gotten tested and even the few symptoms I do have that could be due to low iron levels I feel could also be attributed to other things in my life so I never felt I had to get it checked.

Protein on the other hand is probably a very new deficiency, only these months as I’ve been on a daily deficit and the easiest way to accomplish that has been to eat a lot more veggies. I used to be primarily a carnivore and now I’m basically a vegetarian except for the chicken and tuna I try to have for one meal in my three meals a day. 

I am a total glutton and I love food. But these months with intensive fitness and changes to my caloric intake and just overall elevated stress, I have no passion for food anymore and a lot less appetite. Food really is just a means to an end to fulfill my caloric goal, stay below the deficit, and now to meet my nutritional goals. It’s sad but I’m just going with the physiological flow my body is expressing.

My questions:

1. Short of iron supplements and protein powder, what foods can I incorporate to increase iron and protein? I don’t mind boring foods as again my passion for food has greatly decreased to their utilitarian function. Tonight to actually meet my iron goal which is listed on the app as 100 MG, I made 2.5 cups of spinach. I actually don’t mind spinach (omg Boston Market’s creamed spinach is 💫) but I am gagging 0.5 cups in. I cannot do this everyday.

2. If going the iron supplement route, any recommendations especially for iron (also interested in multivitamins)? I’m female and if I can buy them in Canada that would be fantastic!

3. I want to start building muscles soon as well so I’ve read that protein is very important. Are there foods that I could two birds one stone to meet both iron (100 MG) and protein (73 MG) goals, that won’t extremely increase my daily calories? MFP is giving me a 1240 goal a day. Up to last week it was 1360 and now for some reason it is 1240.

Thank you for any advice!

Edit: I finished the spinach, and I am very happy to report i will be getting iron supplements. 

Also I’m sorry I apparently cannot do measurements. ",2025-08-17 05:42:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1msiruj/ideas_for_iron_and_protein_deficiency/
1mntl3d,loseit,My weight lose update after not losing for months,"I (24f, 5""7) let myself go for an entire year, I'd say its because I just lost my father at the time, I was trying to make sure I graduated university ASAP to find a good job and was thrown to the deep end of adulthood but its also because eating was my way of coping. I went to the gym, but I was never consistent. I was going just enough to be ""active"". I was in denial about my weight gain and kept saying to myself I'm still 80kg (\~175 lb). That was until stretch marks started developing, the clothes I looked good in didn't fit me well, and my face was physically puffy (mooning). I blamed it all on high cortisol (that I never tested for, but the symptoms were all there) because I was stressed; there was no denying it, so I got all my bloods done because I was blaming my environment, not me.   
All my bloods came back fine, I had nothing else to blame but myself in the future and my choices, so I went on the scale, I weighed in at 100kgs (220lbs). I had never been so disappointed in myself.

  
I was always familiar with diets like keto, fasting, or just stopping eating. I also knew I caved after 2 weeks. So I started calorie counting to understand how much I ate and how much I needed to eat to lose weight. I was going to do the generic 1600 calorie deficit and, through scanning, manually inputting foods that I ate every day for a month, with working out 2-3 days per week, I had lost...nothing. How can someone else lose 5kgs on that diet and I don't? How was that fair? I lost that motivation until I started getting angry at myself for thinking of giving up.  
I went further and said to hell with it, I'm going down to 1200 calories. Initially, it was challenging and frustrating because I was eating so little, but I tried to make sure what I was having was healthy or filling, and it was full of fibre and protein. Sometimes I'd have a sweet treat coz I deserved it, but it was always within my calorie intake. I made my workouts more intense and started going to the gym 4 days a week. To motivate myself more, I bought expensive jeans two sizes too small, and every 2 weeks, I'd try them on to see how they fit. Slowly, I was able to button it up, my thighs filled out the jeans where it was meant to be more loose, my stomach stuck out no matter how much I suck it in. Still, I could zip it up, and then see that my thighs no longer filled out the jeans. My stomach wasn't bursting out of them, and then the jeans had some extra space at the back... I was no longer filling them out. 

After 4 months, I weighed myself in and was 90kg (198lb). The progression was slow, but I liked it because I still enjoyed life and eating the food I loved. 

I wanted to lose another 10kg (20lb), so I kept going, kept being consistent, 3 months went by, and weighed in at 88kg. I've been on this same diet and routine for 7 months. Why is my weight loss slowing down? Would settle at that weight out of frustration, but I couldn't allow myself to put all my hard work to waste. I told myself I NEED to see what my body is capable of and how much stronger and healthier I could get. 

I researched for days on what could be the cause and narrowed it down to my body needing a break, my hormones being imbalanced, I need to make my workouts more intense, and I need to have enough protein. So I changed my plan, I ate at maintenance for 2 weeks to reset my body, and instead of going back down to 1200, I did a 1400 calorie deficit. I was eating more food, but this also allowed me to ensure I was getting enough protein in my diet, where I ate at least 100g instead of 50g. I also continued working out 4 days a week, but I started to prioritise compound workouts and progression overload. PHYSICALLY, I could see the changes; my muscles were becoming more visible, and that scale was moving again. After a month, I weighed in at 85kg. Finally, it was working again and I AM proud of myself.

My next steps are to take care of my hormones through supplements or finding foods that help support them, to take my journey to the next level.

I'm sorry if this was a long post. I wanted to share my story of what's helped me not just to return to the person I was, but to a better version of myself. If someone who sees this is in my position, please don't give up; time passes anyway, so you might as well do something with it.

1mnh1jg,loseit,Disappointed/confused on how slow my weight loss is despite definitely being in a deficit! Any thoughts?,"I’m a 30 year old woman, 160 lbs, eating 1,400 calories a day and doing 30 mins on the treadmill daily. I started at 161.8 and after 3.5 weeks I’m at 160.2. I’ve never lost weight this slow before and usually see consistent results, especially when I exercise.

Last month bloodwork showed vitamin D and B deficiencies, but I’ve been taking supplements for a month. I eat well, focus on protein, and don’t think I’m logging wrong enough to explain this. Even if I was going over 200 calories, after my exercise I feel like I’d still be losing? I get about 8 hours of sleep but wake up a few times so my sleep isn’t the best, so maybe cortisol could be it? I don’t track sodium, so maybe it’s water weight? I also think maybe I should be drinking a lot more water maybe. 

any thoughts?

1ml8p1h,loseit,Loose skin with moderate weight loss?,"Hoping someone can relate to this! After about 4 years of slowly gaining weight, I decided to make big changes to my diet. I’m not adhering to any strict diet other than keeping CICO in mind. My original weight was about 170 and I’m 26, 5’5”, a lady.

I’ve lost about 20 lbs in the last 3 months so far, and everywhere I look online, it’s showing that I shouldn’t be having loose skin with this amount of loss. It’s not that my skin is sagging, but it’s very jiggly and easier to maneuver, resulting in me looking soft. This is fine with me as I am not going hard with weight lifting at the moment.. but is it normal? My sister said this amount of weight loss is “slow.” 

I feel like the amount of skin I can just grab onto on my arms is a fair bit. And it stretches out A LOT if I pull. I thought me being young would buffer this a little bit, but no, the boobies are also suffering.

Should I be doing something differently? Collagen supplements?",2025-08-08 22:13:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ml8p1h/loose_skin_with_moderate_weight_loss/
1mkh9mo,loseit,For women- has getting off birth control helped your journey at all? Did hormonal bc affect your weight?,"I have gained 35 pounds this year and I feel absolutely terrible. I have IBS, anxiety, and am now back in therapy to work through some childhood trauma from emotionally unavailable parents and gaslighting.

So I recognize my mental health combined with binge eating could be a factor in this.

But the thing is, a year ago BEFORE I went on the birth control, I was feeling good despite these things. I lost 10 pounds for my wedding, was eating healthily, and had minimal IBS symptoms. Once the thing got in my arm, it was an adjustment but overall I felt fine. 

Once I started noticing my weight gain, I tried everything I could to stop it. Calorie counting, exercising, even taking certain supplements. I would fluctuate between 5-10 pounds but the trend was always going up. It really messed with my mental health.

I started working out again after a hiatus from an IBS flareup. I went all in. Working out 4-5x a week, counting calories religiously, protein supplements, everything. The scale went down by 4 pounds. Then right back up. IBS symptoms came back.

I am highly considering getting this darn implant OUT OF MY ARM!!!

Has anyone had a similar experience? I understand CICO is a thing and people aren't usually accurate with their calories and blah blah blah. But it doesn't explain how the same calorie deficit I was on when I weighted LESS and was successfully losing weight before birth control was not doing hardly anything after.",2025-08-08 00:48:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mkh9mo/for_women_has_getting_off_birth_control_helped/

For the past 9 months I've really leaned into a more holistic approach to fitness....a mindful mix of asanas and some strength training (can't bench press 40+ yet thoo 😭) to feel strong in my daily life, and really paying attention to what I eat.

My biggest challenge, honestly....especially on WFH days when I'm hopping from one meet to another is to get enough protein in (despite taking curd, chana, panner almost every day).

Recently, with switch to a new role.....it's been harder. And I can feel it in my recovery after a workouts.

So....I've been looking into protein supplements, and Muscleblaze keeps popping up.

but... Gold or Isolate? My stomach is ridiculously sensitive and I bloat so easily. 😑

1mg1x91,loseit,"Massive challenge ahead, what do you guys think?","I was 100kgs (1.91m tall, 25M, probably around 22% body fat) around two weeks ago. Due to a personal event and barely eating, I'm currently at 94kgs (probably much of it is water weight)

I was sitting alone one day and had a wild idea - what if I took on an extreme challenge? So I did.

I'm planning on getting to 80 kgs (while maintaining as much muscle mass as possible) in the next 6 weeks. The plan is to eat around 1500 calories per day, go for a 20-minute morning run (HIIT), a 30-minute evening run, 6x workouts per week (weights), 7-8 hours of sleep, 4 liters of water a day and supplements I've been taking plus a few more (creatine, Ashwaganda, zinc, vitamin d3, omega 3, multivitamins, l carnitine). I've got nothing better to do and I'm looking at a David Goggins like transformation. Probably not the healthiest way to do it but I want to challenge myself.

I'm also not going to eat any sugar (Coke zero as the only ""treat""), zero alcohol, and stick to a very high protein diet (primal-like - eggs, chicken, tuna, ham, protein shakes, electrolytes) with minimal carbs and fats.

Do you think its doable?

I can keep this thread updated on a weekly basis if it helps anyone.

**UPDATE - 2.5 weeks in**

I'm currently at 86-87 kg, so I lost 14-15 since July. Extremely minimal muscle lost. Almost half of my belly fat is gone (I can still grab some), face leaned out, the next 2 abs started peeking through. Much clearer vascularity in arms, forearms, shoulders. Chest leaned out nicely. I'm currently at around 15-16%, starting from around 22%. Much of it was water weight in the beginning with some fluctiations from a week of creatine loading which ended on Thursday.

Overall I feel great. There's definintely some low energy moments throughout the day.

I made some changes to my training routine as it was way too heavy on the joints (and too time consuming). I'm now doing 6x weights, 6x 20min hiit (walk on 6 for 2 min, 10 for 1), and walk between 25,000-30,000. I eat 1600-1800 calories per day and supplement (creatine, aswhaganda, multivitamins, magnesium, l-carnitine). I usually get 160g protein per day (2g/kg of target weight). Hydration is also on point, as is sleep and rest (1 rest day per week, 8 hours sleep per night).

I'm running a daily deficit of around 3000-3500, which so far has amounted to around 2.0-2.5 kg of fat lost per week, and some water and glycogen fluctuations.

I'm on track to get to 13.5% by the end of this week, and around 12% or so by end of next week. I'll keep this going until 10-11% body fat.

I'm expecting metabolism to adapt somewhat soon but so far it's been minimal. My resting heartrate trend also dropped by 10 points almost instantly (from an average of 78 to 68 consistently since I started this regime)",2025-08-02 21:33:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mg1x91/massive_challenge_ahead_what_do_you_guys_think/

This time, I had two back-to-back surgeries and was laid up for about a year. I stepped on the scale and was the biggest I've ever been in June 2025. 
I went to a nutritionist this time, and instead of just calorie cutting im increasing protein, taking supplements, and focusing more on fiber intake. I started running again, and I started taking fitness classes like water aerobics, TRX, spin class. I'm doing really good, I've lost 11 lbs. I'd like to lose 75 more. 

With my new gym membership, I decided to finally conquer my fear of gym equipment. I got an orientation, and I learned to use all the machines. It feels so powerful to be able to do this stuff! 
But now I have no idea how to build a regiment of this. I see influencers all the time talk about ""leg day"" and ""arm day"" and ""cardio day""-- I would really love to balance my workouts like this. 
I see people taking about ""bulking"" and ""cutting""... I understand the basic ideas but like what is the how-to? 

Do I just do like exercises that target arms/ upper body one day, then legs and lower body the next, and then run on day three and go back to arms/upper on day 4? 
Isn't running ""leg day?"" How do I not overwork my legs doing a ""leg day"" AND running for cardio? Should I stick ""arm day"" between them? Should I do 10 mins cardio warm up every time and then arms or legs? 
I tend to overanalyze everything, I'm just looking for someone to help me simplify it. Anyone have a sample workout schedule that helped them lose significant weight? 
Anyone have advice for lifting in general/ building muscle?

1mfeyr2,loseit,Bad brain fog - cause?,"I’m a late 20’s 5’10” female, weighing about 186 lbs. I recently started trying to lose about 25 lbs a few weeks ago- I’ve lost 4 lbs so far which seems to be a healthy rate. I eat at a calorie deficit (aiming for 1700 calories a day) do a workout class (hot Pilates, hot barre, sculpt etc) 3-4x a week and aim for 10-15k steps a day, sometimes I get closer to 20k steps. As for supplements, I started taking berberine before breakfast, and a chromium/caffeine appetite suppressant mid afternoon before a workout class. 

I was feeling really good for the first few weeks, but this week I’ve had terrible brain fog. I can’t focus at work, or on anything at all, and everything except for eating or workout out/walking is overwhelming. My moods have been unpredictable and I’m very irritable. The brain fog got so bad that I left my car keys in the ignition yesterday (thankfully no one stole my car but the engine was dead) and had to charge the battery for 4 hrs today. I then left my purse in the shopping cart at the grocery store and didn’t realize until I got home - I drove back to the grocery store and thankfully someone had turned it into the lost and found. These are some close calls & I’m thankful I live in a nice area but at this point with the brain fog I’m getting concerned for my safety. 

Do you all know what could be causing the brain fog and other symptoms? I stopped taking the supplements today and I think I need to start eating 200-300 more calories a day, maybe I’m burning too much? I did hike a 14er mountain last week (25,000 steps and 1,800 calories burned) so maybe that put me at a deficit for the week? I tried to eat high calorie/carb meals the days before & after but maybe that wasn’t enough. 

Thoughts?

Edit: I’m prescribed 100 mg XR Sertraline and have been taking it for over a decade, so perhaps one of the supplements has been interacting?",2025-08-02 02:14:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mfeyr2/bad_brain_fog_cause/

For most of my life, I’ve struggled with satiety — I would rarely feel full after eating, or if I did, the feeling wouldn’t last long. I’d be hungry again shortly after, sometimes within an hour. Even when eating large, balanced meals, I constantly thought about food throughout the day. It was exhausting.

I’ve taken vitamins and supplements before, but I’ve never been consistent with them. A few weeks ago, after discussing my symptoms with a doctor, I decided to get back on a supplement routine — and everything changed.

B-Complex.
Since adding B-complex to my daily routine, my satiety has completely normalized. I no longer feel hungry right after meals, and I don’t obsess over food all day. I eat, my body processes it, and I naturally get hungry again several hours later, depending on the meal. It’s like my appetite finally works the way it’s supposed to.

I feel like a different person.

If what I’ve described sounds familiar, I seriously recommend booking a doctor’s appointment and getting checked for nutrient deficiencies — especially B vitamins. It might be something that simple.

For a bit of background At the start of 2024, I was 190 lbs at 5'8"", feeling awful, out of shape, and like I'd lost who I was.

Now, at 43 years old, now I'm sitting around 156 lbs with visible abs, stronger, healthier, and more confident than I’ve been in 20 years — and no, I’m not on TRT or anything despite many accusations the only supplements I use are creatine, whey, fish oils, and a multivitamin.

I’d always been active during my adult life apart from when life got in the way when kids were born and life was busy but still trained when I could. 

In 2023, I hit a low point physically and mentally to point I didn't do anything and was making poor food choices and out. I decided to get back to regular lifting, just 3x/week to start. That was the spark.

Since then, I’ve habit-stacked my way into a full lifestyle shift:
✅ Tracking
✅ Daily movement 
✅ Strength training (bodyweight will even work)
✅ Recovery 
✅ Consistency 
 
Although this was not extreme. Still enjoying life — yes, that includes sometimes having what are perceived as bad foods like fast food and take away but obviously within the minority of my meals and being on point the majority of the time however building balance for this.

Now I’m even toying with the idea of entering a bodybuilding comp next year — something I never would've believed possible even a year ago.

1m8dm5j,loseit,How the hell do y'all get enough protein??,"I'm a big guy - 6'3"" 340lbs. Lost 100lbs, kept it off for years, then gained it back over the years following major injuries. Trying to get back on the wagon. I still lift fairly regularly, so I'm at least stronger and while just as heavy as before, *slightly* leaner. Last time around, at 240lbs, I had JUST entered a reasonable bodyfat percentage with my musculature, and know I'm never gonna get below that point. Gotta set realistic goals and all that.

But one piece of wisdom i hear is to eat your body weight or your goal weight in grams of protein. Well at 4cal/g for protein, 340lbs is 1360 calories a day in just raw protein. That's clearly impossible, but even my goal weight of 240lbs means 240g and 960cals of protein. I'm floored at how hard it is to get enough protein, even when I stock up on high protein foods and take protein supplements. 

I had an egg white brekkie sando, a morning scoop of protein, and ate a lean protein filled lunch and I'm feeling pretty stuffed. I enter it all into MFP and I see I've only eaten 87g of protein. Idk how I can get another 100g into my body without seriously overeating let alone another 150g...

1m7lk10,loseit,"Still struggling with weight a year later. Still eating roughly 1200cal a day, yes logging and weighing all the food. Now strength training too. I no longer know what to do.","Hey there. A year ago, more or less, I made a post on this subreddit, because I felt like I was at the end of my rope. And tbh, I've had ups and downs since then, but to be perfectly honest I still am.

To summarize my background: I'm 26, ftm, have been medically transitioning for 6+ years, had an ED in my teens and ever since have been really big on keeping healthy eating + exercise habits, and around year 2/3 of (testosterone) hrt my metabolism seemed to have naturally sped up so I became underweight for the next 3 or so years without really trying or restricting past just generally eating healthy, not overeating, and moving everyday. (I was tracking my macros+calories the whole time, and I have to preface by saying: i do not eat out, pretty much ever. If it happens once a month that's already way out of my routine. I eat at home, homecook all my meals, and weigh all my ingredients. I track every single thing I ingest, so no ""oh maybe you're snacking in between meals and not counting those calories"" - if it goes in my mouth, it goes on my food scale, then in my daily log. So it is with 100% certainty that I say for the better part of these past 5 or so years I have kept a daily intake of around 1200 calories, with some reasonable variation (1400/1500\~ occasionally, up to 1800 once or twice a year on holidays, 800/900\~ ish on really bad days. Yes I know that's not good, but sometimes depression/life events get to you. I'm 165cm/5""4 tall, so yes, I do have a lower intake need generally because of how short I am.)   
Sometime around last year, for some inexplicable reason I seemed to start ballooning up - at first it was a slow creep, but then last summer shit really hit the fan, as I gained around 5kg (10lbs roughly) in one single month. It has been an uphill battle ever since to shed those, with some limited success, as well as trying to look into underlying medical causes. (and yes, I know, 5kg/10lbs might sound like nothing. But again, I'm very short, so it's *extremely* noticeable, and it is the tipping point between me feeling confident in my body, and feeling like a disgusting blob of flesh.)

I have checked my thyroid, and it is actually bordering on hyperthyroidism (which my mom has, so there's gotta be a genetic component there). I had an issue of hyperprolactinemia (likely jumpstarted by stimulation to my nipples from having a masculinizing mastectomy where they preserved my natural nipples, and then just kept going in a feedback loop by stress. Notable event is that same summer I had dealt with probably one of the most stressful situations of my life, that had me pretty much in a constant fight or flight for the better part of june/july.), and I was prescribed cabergoline to stop it... it seemed like it stopped the constant upward climb on the scale, but it didn't help much in shedding the gained weight.  
Now I'm looking at my insulin and glucose level and seeing if I might have some insuline resistance issue. I've been prescribed berberine supplements by my endocrinologist to see if that helps while I investigate this issue, but so far it seems to not have had any effect.   
I have discovered I have IBS-C, which, when triggered, causes me to become extremely bloated and retain a fuckton of fluids - and I know I for sure rack up water weight when I'm having a bad spell, because I've gone entire weeks without a single BM, and then lost up to 2kg/4lbs in one go when I finally managed to unclog myself (It seemed insane to me too, but it's happened multiple times).

Now - while desperately trying to decrease my intake and up my exercise, I've started strength training on top of all the various medication changes since last year. More or less, it seemed to be doing *something* \- over the course of the year between last summer and now, I had managed to lose 3kg (5lbs) of the gained weight - and honestly, I felt a lot better than even before, because while I still recognized that some areas had stubborn fat that I just could not stand having on my body, due to the exercise I had gained a lot more muscle, and had a lot more visible muscle definition. I recognize there are some ghosts of my ED that will never truly leave, and that I was looking at my body pre-weight gain with rose tinted glasses, because in my head skinnier=better. In truth, I was emaciated, weak, and while I did love finally not having any fat at all in my hips or thighs for the first time in my life, I do think my overall shape had become a lot more masculine since the muscle mass made me a lot more top heavy. Things felt like they were on the road to getting better.

  
And then... things seem to have come crashing down, again, as summer rolls around. Again - I have not changed a *single* thing about my daily routine. I eat around 1200 calories a day. I make sure to hit my protein and fiber goals. I strength train 40/50 minutes a day, for 5 days a week, on top of walking 10k steps every day. I don't consume liquid calories - the only liquids I drink are water, black coffee, and extremely occasionally a diet soda or zero sugar energy drink.   
And yet... I've gained back all the weight I lost, my muscle definition has seemingly evaporated, and I look like a bloated, pudgy mess. I had a brief IBS-C flare up earlier in the month, but I've managed to deal with it - I hoped it was another spell of water weight that would go away as soon as I managed to have a BM, but nope. The scale keeps going up. 

I have no idea what it is about summer that does this to my body, if it is the heat (where i live it can get up to 40C/104F) and water retention, or maybe somehow substituting more fresh/raw fruits and vegetables instead of cooked greens (the only discernible change in my diet, since it's too hot to turn the stove/oven on for every meal) somehow has a negative effect on my body. But it feels like I'm going to have to spend another year to undo the damage, and I'm so tired. I don't know what's wrong with me anymore. By all metrics, I should be losing weight. My doctors and endocrinologists are puzzled as fuck, because everything about my bloodwork suggests I should be having a hard time gaining weight, if anything, and struggling with unintentional weight *loss*, not gain.   
All the TDEE estimates I've done say my maintenance should be around 1800.   
The only area where I think I could possibly improve personally is that I struggle to get enough sleep (my average is around 6 hours a night, 7 on a good day and 5 on a bad one, sometimes I manage 8 but I'm just too busy in a day to be in bed by the time I should be/stay in bed as long as I should), but could that alone really be doing *that* much damage?

I don't know what I'm sending this post out for, truthfully. Last time I posted I got no traction. I doubt I will get any traction this time, either. But I just cannot deal with the blobfish I see in the mirror everyday. I was so happy with myself, I had discovered two different versions of my ideal self, and I've lost them both. I cannot deal with this, even if it's a temporary thing that happens every summer. I've always had a little bit of weight gain in summer that then went away within the first month of fall, but it's never been this bad - and if this year is gonna be anything like last year, it'll take me 6+ months to bounce back, if I bounce back at all. I just want to be happy with who I see in the mirror again. I want to feel like my body's mechanisms make logical, scientific *sense* and I can work with them to my advantage. I no longer understand or know the beast I'm working with. Please, if there's anyone here on reddit that has any advice - maybe there's something I'm doing wrong, still. Maybe I'm missing something crucial. Maybe there's an extremely obscure condition that I had no idea existed that someone can illuminate me about. Please - anybody who has five cents to give, help.",2025-07-23 21:18:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m7lk10/still_struggling_with_weight_a_year_later_still/
1m7k79o,loseit,500 calorie daily deficit is kicking my butt!,"I am running a 500 calorie per day deficit on the LoseIt app based on a sedentary male, 5'7"" tall, 178 lbs. I am fairly muscular, just looking to ""de-fluff"" a bit, which I have done before. For reference, at around 163lbs, I have very visible abs and my veins become quite prominent (for reference as to body type, not bragging). 



I track everything I eat, which averages out to about 1,875 calories per day over the week. Macros are roughly 35% each protein and carbs, 30% fats. I only eat whole foods (meat, fish, rice, eggs, veggies, fruit, etc.), plus a couple of protein supplements to get me to my protein goal. I go to bed between 9 and 10PM every day, and I get up at 5AM. I just picked this deficit back up after a 3-month ""maintenance"" break (which involved me gaining about 12lbs). This week, I have lost \~5lbs. Not concerning to me, I had been drinking over the last couple of weeks so I suspect cutting out my good friend Jack caused me to let go of a lot of retained water. I suspect that I'll lose 1-1.5lbs over the next week, based on recent scale trends.



I work from home in an office job and I have a standing desk, so I basically stand at my computer for 10 hours a day, hence the sedentary selection.



Six days a week, I walk on the treadmill at a 10% grade for 25 minutes at 3.5mph, plus lift weights for \~40 minutes. Mostly compound movements + some accessories (think modernized traditional bro-split). On the day I don't lift, I walk either 5 miles outside or 45 minutes on the treadmill (same speed and grade).

  
Outside of planned exercise, I walk a couple of miles slowly with my wife and kids a day. I also do odd chores (mowing the lawn, vacuuming, other dad stuff) on most days. I don't log any of this, I consider this as all just daily life stuff a sedentary person would do.

  
Basically, I count my planned exercise in the app, which allows me to exceed the recommended \~1,600 calories per day and still ""meet"" the goal. I'm logging the treadmill stuff at about 150 cals/25 minutes and the lifting at 130/40 minutes. I've done this in the past with great success, but this go around I feel constantly exhausted. Does it sound like this is just a honeymoon phase from getting back to a deficit, or do you think I should up my calories?",2025-07-23 20:25:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m7k79o/500_calorie_daily_deficit_is_kicking_my_butt/

1m5j0h3,loseit,Struggling to decide on calories/protein target?,"Hi guys


I've been lifting weights for around 18 months now and have seen a little drop in body fat and decent gain in muscle and definition, however I've decided it's finally time to start tracking my calories and other macros. 

For reference I am 5'6"", weigh 87 kg and am 24, the scales at my gym put me currently at around 22% bodyfat, however I am pretty sure I am closer to 30% at least. I recently posted a progess pic so you can see that on my profile if you want. The only supplements that I take is are creatine, protein shakes and sometimes psyllium husk for fibre. 

My goal will be to get my fat down closer to 15% whilst ideally still gaining muscle or at least maintaining. Given my body fat I believe this will be possible. 

After a bit of research I have set a calorie goal of 2,200 and protein goal of 135 grams. Does that sound about right or do you think I should tweak it further? 

I should also add that I will likely try and track other macros in the future, but to begin with I'm just going to worry about protein and calories. ",2025-07-21 13:32:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m5j0h3/struggling_to_decide_on_caloriesprotein_target/
1m5ez2w,loseit,Do you think taking collagen actually helps with loose skin or stretch marks?,"I lost enough weight where I'm thinking about the effects of extra skin. I lotion myself regularly and I'm in my very early thirties and I was just over 300 when I started loosing weight. 

Now I'm down almost 50 lbs and am seeing areas where there might be extra skin already.

I keep seeing how collagen helps and taking supplements helps but it's hard to differentiate between ""weight loss scam"" and real actual facts. Especially because skin can take a year to reach it's full ""elasticity returning"" potential. 
It's also worth noting that I gained 130 lbs after 2020 and I've read that being obese for a shorter period of time night help with elasticity as well? 
Idk, there's so much information out there and it's hard to know what to believe. 

My body has so many stretch marks and I know I'll just have to deal with loose skin no matter what, but it would be nice if it's an option to have less loose skin!

I just know that there are so many of you on a weight loss journey, too, and might have a lot of wisdom. 

So, collagen can help, but is really worth it?

1m4rlpf,loseit,52 yo man starting weight-loss journey- suggestions?,"I’m an average guy who has always struggles with weight.  depression tends to send me down some bad habits- not using as an excuse just the reality.  I don’t like the small town I live in but I caregive for my parents - one of whom has developed some serious health issues this year- so moving is not an option.  also a social anxiety type introvert so joining a group has its own challenges.  

 last time I felt healthy was 2 years ago- had saved money and went to Europe for 3 months.  hiking and wondering ruins and museums was hard at first but by the end I was in my feet and walking from morning until late at night, actually eating fairly decent and was stronger then I felt in years.  and I lost 50lbs… I was down to 244.  walking all day didn’t wind me like it did at the start, and large hills and towns with uneven steps (109 from where my room was down to the restaurant and water area in one coastal Italian town) didn’t faze me.  the sun and sea water all contributed to where I felt better then I had in years.  but that was not something I can repeat due to $$$, so time to make changes at home.

came home and the day to day routine just gave me zero motivation, depression set it and two years later- while I did go back up to 298lbs, I am now down to 271lbs with diet changes, I need to start doing more.  on top of caregiving I started a stressful toxic job in April and given the insanity of it, the daily pressure on my chest, no at 170/110, and the anxiety, I need to make changes now.  saw a doctor, took some time off, and we discussed a few things- I am eating ok, -we are a cooking family- so vegetables and protein every evening-but need to drop breads and sugar (coffee, soda only time I use), daily exercise and keep a regular sleep schedule.

normally when I have started at the gym (which I am starting tomorrow), I head straight to cardio.  I have asthma but a few preventative shots before I start tend to not make that an issue.  I am also focusing on sleeping, and have started baths and controlled breathing (helped in past for the anxiety).  cannot walk outside as we are covered in forest fire smoke (see asthma), so gym is my option.

i am here as I am trying to find a routine to do.  most times I wander the gym and while the treadmill will assist with getting me to the point where I can hold me own in a gym, I just fumble around the rest, trying to find the right exercises to do.  my focus is back strength - as that is usually what I hurt when I start this routine- legs just need firming up and have an ok idea what to do there.  mostly mimic others for chest and arms.

any place I can find a good beginners workout?  not looking for supplements, and would prefer not to spend money on apps unless I talk to others that use them.  any you tubers for overweight men in 50s trying to slim down. help?

I didn’t really have those features as a teenager (I'm 21 now), but I’ve always had a pear-shaped body. Even when my BMI was around 19, my legs were always where my body stored fat the most. I honestly think it runs in my family, because my mom and sister are shaped the same way, it’s definitely a strong trait in us.

I don’t think having thicker legs automatically makes someone less attractive. It’s just that for me, it doesn’t really feel like it suits my overall look. My weight is normal, but I still want to lose a few more kilos.

I want to slim down and burn fat without building muscle. I'm already on a balanced diet and lost 4 kg, but food alone isn’t enough unless I starve myself – which I won’t, because i might worry that i start to develop an ed.

I can’t do intense workouts due to a health condition, but I’d exercise lightly as often as I can. I heard stretching can make muscles appear slimmer, is that true?

Are there ways to train just for fat loss, not muscle gain? Any helpful foods, vitamins, or supplements?

1m3gi3g,loseit,I lost control for half a year; I want to come back. Advice needed.,"Hello, this is a very embarrassing post to make.

I just turned 19 (yesterday) and I want to turn my life around. Due to an intense sickness I came down with around December that absolutely tanked my mental health, I've mostly been sitting and in bed, and not at all watching my food intake. I eat a ton (mostly junk food) and I don't exercise almost at all. I'm really tired of living this way. I've gained weight so fast that my entire body is covered in stretch marks so I'll never look normal again, but at least if I lose weight the pain will go away.

I have intense back pain when standing for too long, and it gets even worse when I lay down. I can barely get back up sometimes. I just want to live life like a normal person again, I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to eat normally, or what supplements to take, or what exercises to do because I'm just scared.

I'll answer any questions I need in order to help myself. Thank you for your help.

Here are some questions I have:

* I have no idea what weight I am, but I assume a minimum of 230-250 pounds at 5'5"". According to the first TDEE calc I used, I should be doing around 1600 for a deficit. Is this too many calories?
* Should I be taking any supplements?
* I have very low energy due to my lifestyle, so it can be hard to cook at all sometimes. Also, I live with 4 other people, so fridge space is extremely limited. Just realized this isn't really in question form, so, what should I do?
* Is walking even though my back is in pain going to make my back pain worse?
* What other kinds of exercise should I be doing? I'm also looking to build muscle while I lose fat if possible.
* This part is the most important IMO: I'm extremely embarrassed to go outside, so if I can exercise inside my house that'd be great.",2025-07-18 22:52:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1m3gi3g/i_lost_control_for_half_a_year_i_want_to_come/

1lx18w0,loseit,"32M/185kg - 6 weeks in, lost 15kg. Bloodwork improving. What should I focus on next?","**Hey everyone,**

I'm 6 weeks into what I hope will be my final transformation attempt, and I'd love some guidance on what to prioritize next.

**Background:**

* 32M, 185kg (\~410lbs) currently (down from 210kg/\~470lbs)
* Lost 50kg once before with extended water fasting but regained it all over 5 years due to poor follow-up, depression.
* This time I'm focusing on sustainable changes rather than extreme measures

**What I've done so far (past 6 weeks):**

* Completely eliminated bread and sugar (been 2 months now)
* Drastically reduced seed oils and processed foods
* Increased protein intake significantly - added ON whey protein
* Started creatine supplementation (10-20g daily during loading, now moving to 5g maintenance)
* **Not counting calories** \- just focusing on food quality

**Training split:**

* 6 days/week: Workout A → Light Cardio/rest → Workout B → Light Cardio/rest → Workout A → Light Cardio → Rest
* **Workout A**: Goblet squats, seated cable rows, DB bench press, leg press, face pulls, planks
* **Workout B**: Romanian deadlifts, lat pulldowns, overhead press, hamstring curls, face pulls, dead bugs
* Sometimes add extra work on cardio days if I feel good (farmer walks, incline planks, curls)

**Results so far:**

* Weight: 210kg → 185kg (25kg/55lbs in 6 weeks)
* Energy levels: Dramatically improved
* Bloodwork: TSH and HbA1c both showing improvement (hba1c down from 8.4 to 6.4 now )
* Strength: Steadily increasing weights each week
* Sleep: Much better quality, \~8-9 hours of sleep. (This was a major issue, since I didn't have a 9-5 or a daily routine, my sleeping schedule/circadian rhythm, as well as sleep duration, was always random, some days I'd sleep 3 hours, others 12 hours of sleep lol)

**Current diet approach:**

* High protein (aiming for 280-300g daily)
* Very low carb (probably <50g most days)
* Eating a lot of organ meats (liver, hearts, kidneys)
* Whey protein shakes to hit protein targets
* Not tracking calories, but definitely in a deficit based on results

**Questions:**

1. **Training:** Should I add more volume or stick with the current plan? especially on my light cardio days? I can handle more, but don't want to overdo it.
2. **Nutrition:** Any concerns with eating organ meats daily? Getting great nutrition, but want to make sure I'm not missing anything.
3. **Supplements:** Currently just creatine, whey, Magnesium (L-threonate in the morning, Glycinate before bed), and 10,000 IU Vitamin D daily (My serum Vitamin D was \~18 now at \~30) . Worth adding anything else?
4. **Next phase:** What should I focus on to lose fat and gain muscle? When should I consider changing approach?

I learned from my previous failure that consistency beats intensity. This time feels different - I'm not suffering, energy is great, and I'm actually enjoying the process.

Any advice on what to prioritize next or potential pitfalls to avoid? Especially interested in hearing from people who've made similar journeys, since most information/guidelines online apply mostly to people with much less body weight than what I'm starting at.

1lx0gqd,loseit,No I’m doing everything “right” and still gaining weight — I feel completely defeated,"Hi Reddit,
I’m 32(f) and honestly, I’m at my wit’s end. I’ve always been a small person — even growing up, weight was never an issue for me. But over the past three years, my weight has completely skyrocketed, and despite doing everything I can think of, it’s still climbing. Fast.

I eat normally. I weigh my food, I get plenty of protein, I exercise consistently — I’m in the gym lifting weights several times a week. I walk around 6–7k steps per day. I track, I plan, I put in the work. But nothing is working. In fact, the opposite is happening.

I’ve spent thousands on nutrition coaching. Literal thousands. And not only did I lose no weight, I watched the number on the scale go up. Every week I track my weight and my graphs are just a terrifying uphill slope. I feel like I’m in a never ending nightmare. For reference, I eat between 1500 and 1700 a day, I’m 5ft. EDIT FOR CONTEXT - I lost 10kg by eating 1500 a day, 6k steps a day 4 years ago. 

I started taking supplements recently and while I do feel more energized, it hasn’t helped the weight gain. I’ve already gone up two dress sizes in the past two years, and I’m very close to needing to go up another. I hate how I look in clothes. I hate how I feel in my own body. I’m so uncomfortable and demotivated and scared.

I’ve been to the doctor. I’ve had my thyroid checked. I was told it’s “fine” but I’m starting to wonder if I should go back and ask to actually see the numbers — maybe get a full thyroid panel? 

And to top it all off, I was just quoted £250/month for more nutrition coaching — which I absolutely cannot afford. That felt like such a blow, like I had one last option and now that’s gone too.

I’m stuck. I’m scared. I’m sick of feeling like I’m broken. I’m going on holiday at the end of September and instead of being excited, I just feel like crap. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. If anyone has gone through something like this or has any ideas of what this could be please, please let me know.

EDIT - I want to lose the weight gradually so don’t want any crash diet information. ",2025-07-11 07:14:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1lx0gqd/no_im_doing_everything_right_and_still_gaining/
1lwoku8,loseit,"98 kg → ? in 2 months? Night-shift guy, new to gym, belly/thighs/bum fat—how much can I drop?","Hey everyone

I’m 24M, 172 cm, 98 kg right now. I do 6 PM–3 AM night shifts, so my whole routine is flipped.

My body fat is stubborn around my **stomach, thighs and bum**, even when I’ve lost weight before.

Here’s what my recent labs show:  
High CRP (inflammation)  
Low Vitamin D3 (9.5 ng/ml) and B12 (188 pg/ml)  
High prolactin (43 ng/ml) and cortisol  
Estradiol E2 is 41 pg/ml (upper range for men)

So I decided to fix this for real.

This is what I’m doing already:  
Intermittent fasting 16:8 with meals between 7:30 PM–3:30 AM  
Walking 12,000 steps a day  
Supplements: Vitamin D, B12, creatine, shilajit  
Planning to start **gym next week, 6x/week:** heavy lifting, HIIT, core

Problem is I’m **brand new to the gym** and have no trainer. I’m piecing workouts together from YouTube, Reddit, and random advice. I don’t want to hurt myself or waste time.

So I need your help:

1. How much fat or weight can I realistically expect to lose in **2 months**, assuming I put in full effort and stick to a strict deficit and IF?
2. What should I focus on in the gym to **target belly, thighs and bum fat** (even if it's overall loss habits)?
3. Any essential tips for a newbie in strength training—form, programming, recovery—that can help me avoid mistakes?

Where can I share my pictures?

Would appreciate honest advice or even tough love! ",2025-07-10 21:19:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1lwoku8/98_kg_in_2_months_nightshift_guy_new_to_gym/
1lvx97q,loseit,I need advice!! Looking to lose weight healthily but quickly. (Summary at the bottom),"I’m 19, female, 5'2"", and currently weigh 140 lbs—this is the heaviest I’ve ever been. Over the last year, I’ve fluctuated between 130–137 lbs. Before that, when I was playing a competitive sport and struggling with mental health, I was in the 115–125 lb range. My goal now is to get back to 115 lbs, ideally as soon as possible, but I want to do it in a way that’s still healthy and sustainable.

I work full-time in construction (8 hours a day). My job includes walking a lot, kneeling, using tools, and occasionally lifting things around 20–30 lbs—but nothing extreme. I typically get 7,000 to 12,000 steps a day. I’ve recently started incorporating 30 minutes of cardio after work, either biking (preferred because of knee issues) or 15 minutes of jump rope if I’m short on time. My goal is to burn at least 200 calories during each workout.

I try to get 7–8 hours of sleep but usually average closer to 6–7. Last month was especially stressful because of school, but that’s over now, so I’m trying to reset and create better habits.

As for food, I typically eat between 1300–1600 calories a day. My breakfast is usually a protein shake (~350 cal). Lunch is usually a salad, sandwich, or a meat/rice/veggie combo (~300–400 cal), and dinner is around 400–500 cal. I try to keep snacks healthy (~100 cal), but occasionally I’ll eat something more indulgent (up to ~400 cal), which I’m working on limiting.

I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and am waiting on an endoscopy, so I still eat gluten but notice I feel and better when I eat less of it, but my body absorbed less nutrients and I went to the washroom more so ever since I stopped eating as much gluten it pushed my to the 140 mark. To help with digestion and fiber, I add chia seeds to meals and take Metamucil daily. I drink a 36 oz water bottle every day, plus around 1–2 extra cups of water.

For medical background: I have slight high blood pressure, low iron (on supplements), ADHD (I take Ritalin, which helps a bit with Impulse eating), and joint pain that makes high-impact cardio harder. I’ve also been on birth control for 5 years due to extreme ovulation pain, though the underlying issue was never diagnosed despite an ultrasound.

I’ve just started taking green tea and berberine supplements to help with energy, metabolism, and blood sugar. I’ve only been consistent with this routine for a few days, but I really want to stick with it this time. My biggest struggle is motivation—I tend to give up after minor setbacks and I want to break that cycle. I just want to finally feel comfortable in my body again.

Age/Sex: 19F
Height/Weight: 5’2"", 140 lbs → Goal: 115 lbs
Work: Construction (8 hrs/day); light/moderate activity
Steps: 7k–12k daily
Cardio: Biking/jump rope, aiming to burn 200 cal/session
Sleep: 6–7 hrs (trying for 7–8)
Calories: 1300–1600/day
Diet:
 • Breakfast: Protein shake + chia oats (~400 cal)
 • Lunch: ~300–400 cal
 • Dinner: ~400–500 cal
 • Snacks: Usually ~100 cal, sometimes up to 300
Hydration: 36+ oz water daily
Health conditions:
 • Celiac (awaiting endoscopy)
 • ADHD (on Ritalin)
 • Low iron (on supplements)
 • Mild high BP
 • Knee issues
 • On birth control
Supplements: Iron, Metamucil, green tea, berberine
Estimated burn from job: ~1,300 cal/day
Estimated TDEE: ~2,000–2,200 cal/day
Biggest challenge: Staying motivated and not giving up after setbacks
Please give me advice to know if I’m in the right track and things I can do better I know calorie deficit is a huge part of this but I need to eat to have energy at work.

1lvnpik,loseit,My body hurts and im exhausted,"I have been losing weight since march (i lost 5kgs in 3 months going from bmi 22 to bmi 20). My goal is to lose like 1 or 2 more kgs. I’ve started exercising more. I eat lots of proteins. Im very focused on my macros and try to eat more organically. I reduced processed sugars a lot and i used to reduce sugar but now im back to eating a lot of natural sugars but maybe its too much (im talking fruits, yoghurt stuffs like that).

Recently ive been having body aches and cramps. For example right now my right arm hurts a lot as if someone was crushing my forearm.. i feel exhausted too. What i don’t understand is that im taking supplements such as vitamins and all and i took a blood test a few time ago which was good.

Is this cause by weight loss or something else? Im thinking it might be bone/muscle cramps",2025-07-09 16:46:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1lvnpik/my_body_hurts_and_im_exhausted/

Perhaps especially from those of you who are also strength training and aiming for a body recomp as well as weight loss. 

I’m currently taking creatine, electrolytes with collagen (I live in the south and walk at least 6 miles/day outside - lots of sweating), acacia powder to help me hit my fiber goals, and an omega 3 supplement. I’m also curious about magnesium glycinate which I’ve heard can help with sleep and recovery. 

If you think supplements are BS, I hear you, but no need to comment on this post. I’m curious to hear from people who have found something they think is helping them.

1. Best free fitness and weight loss apps and resources for gym use.
2. Recommended gym routines and equipment for effective weight loss.
3. Can intermittent fasting, keto diet, or OMAD (one-meal-a-day) be safely included in my journey?
4. Given my graveyard shift, when’s the best time to work out?
5. Can I take liver and gallstone supplements? Turns out I have fatty liver and gallstone problems.
6. Worst case scenario, but how fast can I continue my journey after getting a gallbladder operation?
7. Any other tips, diet, behavior, motivation, hacks, or habits that helped you?

1lty69b,xxfitness,6 Months of Consistency- a mini review,"I wanted to share my experience making many changes this year as a short, early 30s, pretty unathletic woman. Progress is slow, but good. 

Background

I've been touch-and-go with my fitness levels since my teen years. Over the covid-era, I was doing fitness blender videos at home 5x/week, walking regularly, running \~10-15 miles a week, and lost 30lbs. This was **much easier** than it is now because: I was younger, I cooked all my own meals, I had a ton of free time due to everything being closed, I was single, and I was just past a breakup and I wanted a revenge body! My stats at this time were 5'2, 28 y/o, 145lbs. 

Then I met my now-husband. I was still working out, and still running, but he was bartending (I got free beer), and he lived a city away from me (I was commuting 45min each way just to date!). Return to office happened, stealing another hour from my day. The runs became less frequent, and my weights started collecting dust. 

Then there was a major death in the family. Then I got married. Moved cities. Started a new job. Dog died. Sold my old house. Job got hard. Dec 2024, I was 5'2, 32y/o, 180lbs. Not working out. Shit! I am all about giving myself grace in hard times, but the hard times aren't ending and I have other goals! We are talking about having kids, and for that to happen, I wanted to get my health back under control. At this point I was vaping, drinking, and when I tried working out, my knees were killing me. I needed a whole revamp of my routine. 

Starting off

In December, I made a conscious decision to quit vaping. I had been lowering my nicotine concentration, but December is the last time I had ANY. I kept a no-nic vape in my possession for the first week of January, but that's the last time I touched it. Goal one: done! This has also, I assume, made my breathing a lot easier in high-intensity exercises. 

In January, I quit drinking (temporarily- for a hard reset.) We do dry January every year, but I extended it well into February as well. Since then, I'd say I cut back my drinking from \~15 drinks a week, to 3-4. I am content here, until we start trying to conceive more seriously. I also got back into the habit for working out around 30-40 minutes 5x per week. These are 95% at-home workouts- I have a set of powerblocks (2.5-50lb adjustable weights) and a bench. I found that by keeping the fitness blender calendars, I'm way more likely to complete a routine even if I go off-script from the video. Every month I give myself the option to switch up the focus- I just completed 2 months of strength training and this month I'm incorporating more HIIT and plyo work with the FB30- workouts for busy people. I'm not associated with FB in anyway, I just have used them off and on for the last several years and I'm familiar with the trainers and the layouts. 

In February I started taking my diet more seriously. I'd worked with a trainer for a short stint in 2023 and used the same macros from back then- 1700 calories total, minimum of 100g protein. Was I great at sticking to this? For a week or two at a time, sure. Not long term. I'm still working on this. 

Since then, I've stayed the course for my workouts. I've completed over 130 workouts this year, averaging about 5 workouts a week with some days taken off due to illness. I went off HBC in May, and I am dealing with body changes from that as well. I have been taking some supplements to help with the transition, and an old diagnosis of PCOS: Myo-inositol, magnesium, a prenatal, Vitamin D + K2, and creatine. I have experimented with beef organ supplements as well, but was not a fan. 

What's Changed

My cardio has greatly improved. In December, I could *probably* run a mile, but I wouldn't be confident about it. Now I am very confident that I can run a 5k if it's not over 75F outside. I can run hills, and my ankles and knees don't bother me. I am slow, but I have always been slow. I am very pleased when I am under a 12 minute mile. 

My very first workout, lunges were impossible to complete three sets of 8/side with just bodyweight. My knees were screaming at me to please stop. Now, I can complete 3 sets carrying 30lbs. I can't do full jumping lunges yet, but I can jump into a lunge, and jump back to neutral. This is a HUGE win for me!! 

I went from doing 0 full pushups to 3. I wish this was over 10, but I'll take the win. All of my other lifts have increased slightly, but nothing to brag about. I'm limited to my grip strength with my at-home set up, and I DO think I'd see more impressive increases if I were at a full gym. 

My weight has fluctuated throughout- my heaviest was 186 in February, and my lowest was 176lbs. My number this morning was.......exactly the same as my starting weight! I did have hot dogs and beer over the weekend, but as you can tell, it hasn't changed much. I don't have a great way to measure my body fat, but I have obviously done a small body recomp. My shoulders are much more pronounced, and my waist belt has gone down a notch. It is subtle, but I am hoping it is sustainable. 

I am also a lot more confident in my body- wearing crop tops with high waisted leggings and being willing to try new fashion ideas. Thanks to everyone in this sub for teaching me the ways of Old Navy Powersoft- those 6"" shorts are my summer uniform now. 

# Goals for the Future

I am very happy with my level of activity right now. I think any more and I'd burn out, even if I was physically capable. I want to do something I can keep up with for years, as just part of my day for general health and well being. I want to be able to do yard projects without hurting, sign up for 5k fun runs for charity, and throw my nieces and nephews around without thinking twice about it. I would like to focus in more on my diet- I hear that losing weight makes your hormones more stable as a PCOS-haver, but that it also makes it harder to lose weight. Whatever I can do NOW to make my future easier, I'll at least give a shot. I also want to cut down on caffeine, as I hear it messes with fertility.

1jkgcrl,xxfitness,Feeling Stuck & Frustrated with My Progress – Advice?,"Hey everyone, I don’t usually post, but I’m feeling super frustrated and just need some advice (or maybe just a reality check if I’m being too sensitive).

I’m a **28-year-old female, 5'6"", currently 137 lbs**. A few years ago, I lost **90 lbs** and worked hard to maintain my shape. The best I ever looked and felt was about three years ago—I was **120 lbs, super toned, and confident**. But life happened. Some traumatic situations, the holidays, and other setbacks led me to regain **17 lbs**.

I’ve been **lifting weights, tracking macros, and staying active**, but my body just isn’t responding the way it used to. The number on the scale isn’t even my biggest concern—it’s the fact that **my clothes don’t fit right**, and I feel like I’m actually gaining more fat despite my efforts. I don’t think it’s muscle because I can **see cellulite forming, my arms feel flabby, and I have that “skinny fat” look**. It’s really messing with my confidence.

I even bought a **standing desk** to make sure I’m not too sedentary at work. Could this be **hormonal**? I had bloodwork done recently and found out I’m **slightly anemic**, but I’ve been taking **iron and B12 supplements** to manage it.

I know **17 lbs isn’t the end of the world**, and bodies change over time. But I worked **so hard** to lose the weight, and I don’t want to undo my progress. I also don’t want to fall into unhealthy habits just to lose it again. It’s been **a month and a half** of really sticking to my plan, and if anything, I feel like I’m moving backward.

Should I just keep going and trust the process? Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice on **how to tone back up** and actually see results again? I really don’t want to feel like I’m putting in all this effort for nothing.

Thanks for listening to my rant..",2025-03-26 16:46:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1jkgcrl/feeling_stuck_frustrated_with_my_progress_advice/

1iqzek8,xxfitness,HELP! Is it normal to feel constantly hungry after starting weight training?,"Hey everyone, I’m new here and excited to join this community. I love the support and hype in this community! 

I’m just getting back into weight training after many years of neglecting it. For context, I’m turning 38 in March, I’m a parent of two, and I already incorporate a good amount of cardio and high-intensity training into my routine each week. 

My activity in a week looks something like this: 
2-3 days intense bouldering 
2-3 days weight training 
1-2 active rest days hike or brisk walk with hills 
At least 1 “lazy rest day” no expectations but the normal daily living activities and house cleaning plus chasing a toddler around lol 

Since starting weight training about two weeks ago, I’ve noticed that I am ravenous all the time...like a bottomless pit. Sometimes, I even wake up in the middle of the night “starving”, which is completely abnormal for me and honestly kind of scary. Is this normal? I am making sure that I am drinking lots of water as well. Will it taper off, or should I be taking a closer look at my calorie intake and macros? I feel like something might be missing.

For reference:
*I’m 5’7” and around 128 lbs (depending on the time of the month, lol).
*I’m not 100% sure of my body fat percentage, but based on measurements, I’d estimate around 18%.
*My goal with weight training is to FEEL strong, and attempt a proper body recomposition for the first time in my life. I have long-term health and wellness goals, but also, let’s be real—some slightly vain ones too! I’d love to be in the best shape of my life before 40. More than anything, I want to keep up with my kids, stay strong for my active hobbies, and feel great while remaining injury-free.

For supplements, I’m currently taking:
*A daily multivitamin
*Magnesium and electrolyte powder in a glass of water
*5g of creatine (split into two servings throughout the day, just started about a week ago)
*100% pure whey isolate protein powder to help boost my protein intake, especially on crazy busy days chasing a toddler around
*BCAAs for extra support
*A scoop of MCT marine collagen in my daily coffee
*On workout days, I take a really nice pre-workout with BCAAs, some adaptogens, and a hint of caffeine, it gives me an even boost without making me feel jittery or buzzy

I’d love any insight or advice from those who’ve been through this! Does the hunger level out? Am I just not eating enough? I am averaging at least 2000 calories a day which seems like a lot…and a good amount of protein (like 120-140+ grams) I should add that I have been doing Keto for nearly 2 months, so my macros look a bit different. 

Thanks in advance for any insight and support ",2025-02-16 18:52:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1iqzek8/help_is_it_normal_to_feel_constantly_hungry_after/

1i4bn59,xxfitness,Looking for the right starting point!,"

Hello all!! I have read the wiki and the guides and am unsure of where I stand. So I came here for advice!

WHO I AM
I am 29 years old. 2 years ago, I started my health journey. I was 195lbs and dropped down to 135 over the course of about 10 months through diet alone (losing 1-3/4lb a week). I would occasionally do some light cardio like walking or hiking but nothing regular enough to significantly contribute to the weight loss. I started to get more serious about exercise once I hit my weight goal. I primarily focus on upper body work.

WHY LESS LOWER BODY WORK?
I don’t currently do any lower body stuff because of my knees. I was around 200lbs in high school and didn’t start being active/losing weight until my early twenties. They started hurting after doing a lot of running from 23-25 (15-25 miles a week, running 3-5 days for an hour weekly). I put on the weight again at 26-27 because I was locked inside for the pandemic and big sad I couldn’t run without pain anymore and ate my feelings.

My knees get pissed whenever I do squats and get incredibly sore when the weather changes/I bloat on my period/if I run or hike frequently. Karate pisses them off a little but the way that squats or high impact exercise does. I avoid lower body because I want my knees to not be mad during my time at the dojo and I am waiting on an expert opinion. I have my first appointment with a physical therapist next week and want to start doing lower body if I get the okay.

DIET/SUPPLEMENTS
I lost the weight eating 2000cal a day for 6 months and then lowering it to 1800. I stayed at 1800 until I was working out consistently 3 days a week. I then upped it to 2000 again. I took creatine the first 3 months after hitting my goal weight/the gym again and after reading more about creatine I started to take up doing 10g a day again.

WHAT I HAVE DONE
I started just doing basic stuff—2 upper body days a week doing everything. I started practicing karate to lightly work on lower body stuff (decent amount of static lunges) and to get in some cardio/learn self defense. This was after the first 2 months of lifting. I was going 2 nights a week and lifting 2 days a week. I started a push day, a pull day, and a “glam” day (free weight day with bicep curling and overhead tricep curls). The karate is currently up to 3-4 nights a week and the lifting is at 3 days a week.

WHERE I AM:
I can currently bicep curl and overhead head tricep curl 20lbs (started at 10lbs). I can do 15 wide push ups and 10 military push ups. I can do chin ups on the assisted chin up machine with 25 pounds off of my weight (my PR was 3). 

GOALS:
By the end of the year, I’d like to be able to:
-curl 30-35lbs (bicep and tricep curl)
-30 consecutive wide and military pushups
-10 consecutive chin ups and pull ups with my body weight

WHAT NOW?
After reading, I think that my gains are mainly beginners luck. I eat about 2100-2200 a day with 80-100g protein. I started this 2 months ago and my weight hasn’t budged. I am unsure if I would be considered a beginner or intermediate for these programs. I have read a lot of the guides and truly am unsure of what the next step is.",2025-01-18 16:48:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1i4bn59/looking_for_the_right_starting_point/

I’m just starting out, but most communities I’ve joined tend to either mostly only have men, or only have women who mostly diet and aren’t really into gym fitness or bodyweight fitness. And this subreddit is not super active either. Mixed communities are more difficult for me to deal with because men’s progress is different, and they tend to have larger budgets for buying equipment/supplements etc. ",2025-01-04 11:56:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1htcwsg/discord_community_for_womens_fitness/

1gt1ag1,xxfitness,Trying to get into weightlifting for the first time. Struggling with DOMS and macros,"Sorry for the long post.

Tl;Dr- Are extreme DOMS temporary for fitness noobs? How the hell do I figure out my macros when needing to lose a lot of weight AND wanting to gain muscle.

I am currently a very unfit, very obese couch potato and trying to lose fat and get into weightlifting. I am 40, 5'10 and currently 275 lbs. My fitbit scale says my body fat is 45% and my lean mass is about 145lbs. I know these scales aren't super accurate, but I'm confident it's in the right ballpark. Prior to this week, exercise was very casual walks around my neighborhood 2-4 times per week. I've goofed around with light dumbbells and machines but it's been over 5 years and I've never made a serious attempt at heavy lifting before. To be super honest, even though I've lost 30 lbs so far, I'm feeling worse than ever about my body. I noticed my butt is going flat, I can feel there's less muscle under the fat, and I hate it. I also worry it means I'm losing too much muscle with my weight loss. I'm also stalling out on weight loss and hope an increase in muscle mass will help.

I'm starting with Liftoff. For those unfamiliar, it's like ""Couch to 5k"" for lifting and the first phase is a body weight routine with bodyweight squats, pushups, etc. I did day 1 on Wednesday and felt pretty good. Nothing hurt during the routine and I felt tired but not exhausted afterwards. I felt like I gave it my full effort without overdoing it. And then I woke up the next day feeling like I got hit by a truck.

I was supposed to do day 2 yesterday but DOMS were still super bad to the point where walking down stairs or even sitting down was a struggle and I felt completely incapable of doing squats. Arms were achy but not with the same intensity. Core I could feel but it was very minor. I went for a 30 minute walk to see if that would help me feel better. My thighs felt pretty achy and tight the whole time and I was much slower than usual, but it didn't really make me feel better or worse afterwards. I thought that surely I'd feel good today. While I feel better than yesterday, I'm still pretty sore. I did a couple of bodyweight squats as a test and they were pretty uncomfortable but not painful in a ""you're injuring yourself"" sort of way.

How should I proceed from here? Do less sets and/or reps in the beginning? Modify the plan and split things up? Should I rest 2 days in between exercise days to start while I get through what I am hoping is a short period of extreme suck? Start with a different plan and come back to Liftoff in a few weeks? Please reassure me that this is just my body just throwing a big fit at being asked to do way more than usual and it won't always be this bad? At this point I want to do day 2 tonight but I'm kind of scared I'll feel like garbage  and be miserable until this time next week.

When it comes to macros, how do you determine your macros when you want to lose fat \*and\* build muscle? I've read that it's really hard/impossible to do both. I've gone back and forth on this a lot and I think in the short or medium term if I **have** to pick one, I would like to prioritize fat loss for now given I need to lose so much fat. But on the other hand, I don't want weightlifting to be miserable/impossible. I think I might be ok with a slowdown in fat loss but I would not be ok if the fat loss stopped. I currently weigh everything I eat and eat 1600-1800 calories most days but as I said above, weight loss has slowed to about half a pound a week. Do I just stick to my current calories and keep trying to up protein for now? Or are my macros making my DOMS worse and/or setting me up to fail? Is there a specific calculator or formula that is best for my scenario to give me a macro starting point? If I have a desk job but am doing bodyweight/lifting 3x a week does that count as low intensity or medium intensity? TDEE calculators vary wildly and have left me confused.

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading! This subreddit has been a huge inspiration already and I'm looking forward to being fit in the future with all of you!

**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for all the support and great advice! I realized I was super overthinking things and you all really alleviated my fear of ""maybe this isn't going to be for me"". I'm going to up my calories a bit for the next month and put those towards getting more protein. I'm also going to look into some supplements like magnesium and see if that helps.

For the routine itself, I'm going to do a ""Phase 0"" and cut the reps down in each set by half to start and then work my way up from there. I still think Liftoff is the right plan for me, I'm just coming from such an extremely low fitness base. I'm fine with taking as long as I need to and I think less reps for the first 1-3 weeks will help me feel less shitty in the beginning and will help me build better consistency.",2024-11-17 00:31:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1gt1ag1/trying_to_get_into_weightlifting_for_the_first/

1gfokez,xxfitness,Mindset shift: $200+/month for fitness is absolutely okay!,"I've been on and off with my fitness throughout my 27 years of life. 

Currently, I've been eating healthy and working out consistently for about 7 months now, but this time is different, this time I'm 100% sure this is my new lifestyle. I'm so happy with my physical results, my energy, my mood, my mental clarity, etc. 

Before, I used to think that paying more than $20/month for a gym was insane. One time a few years ago, I signed up for LA Fitness and couldn't justify paying $38/month so I cancelled the membership. Fast forward to today, I've been on ClassPass for a few months now, and I recently started taking pilates at a studio that is more on the expensive side, so today I had to upgrade my membership to the $199/month in order to take the amount of classes I would want weekly/monthly, and I'm totally okay with that!!! So this morning I realized how different my mindset is in the present and how proud of myself I am for that.

I don't see those $200 as just paying to ""workout"", I see those $200 as an investment to achieve the results I want. I see as an investment in my mental health, my physical health... I'm paying $200 on something I truly look forward to and truly enjoy, I'm paying $200 to be around people that have the same mindset I do, I'm paying $200 for commitment and discipline because before fitness classes, I never showed up to the gym if it was up to me. But now? I have only cancelled one class in the pass 6 months. I'm paying for motivation, for guidance and for being my best self. 

So yeah, I don't think $200/month for fitness is insane anymore. As a matter of fact, if you add vitamins, supplements, work out clothes and other stuff I spent money on a monthly basis it would actually be way more than that! And you know what? I'm so happy this is what I'm spending my money on now. People spend way more than that in ONE night eating at a nice restaurant or going out clubbing, so yes! I'll gladly pay my $200/month membership that is helping me become a better person, both physically and mentally :)",2024-10-30 14:59:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1gfokez/mindset_shift_200month_for_fitness_is_absolutely/
1gdy6sx,xxfitness,I am absolutely destroyed and unable to function after leg work outs for days.,"I'm 43y old, 80kg (176lbs), 186cm (6 foot 1) and started 8 months ago (6 months ago, intense) with more structured, strength training. (Full-Body, no prior fitness experience in the gym but 10years as a dancer in my 20s/30s)

In the beginning I mostly focussed on upper body strength to master chin ups and pull ups which worked absolutely great, I've since incorporated leg exercises (curls, press etc.)

But every time I exercise my legs, I become unable to function for two days. And I don't mean just bodywise... I'm just extremely tired also mentally and can barely function. Does anyone have any tips on what worked for them to mitigate, or better, the effects of this post workout?

**Some facts:**

\* I exercise with a personal trainer 1 x month and about 3times / week. (About 1-2h strength mostly)

\* I'm currently eating 2000 kcal per day with 160g of protein, which is a slight calorie deficit. (My maintenance is around 2,200kcal), my food is mostly balanced, with almost no cheat meals

\* I take twice per week Magnesium supplements

\* I exercise to fatigue when I can on my legs (10 reps x 3)

\* No lab deficiencies on the blood detected

\* Hormones stable (Estrogen & Thyroid)

\* 15% bodyfat (cheap measurement machine in the gym, I don't trust it, I look more like 20-25%)

\* I sleep in average about 7 - 8 hours, sleep amount seems not to change the amount of fatigue I feel

\* I eat before and after training light amounts of protein (eggs etc.)

\* I can push 270lbs (122kg) x 1 on the legpress  but usually train way below that on 10 reps, which is about 80kg (my bodyweight)

\* Leg exercises are mostly: Legpress, Leg Curls, Hip Thrusts, Romanian Deadlifts (I'm 90% sure the technique is 'good' due to my personal trainer)

**Things I will try and incorporate:**

\* I switched as of today to maintenance of my calories, which simply means I get to eat about 2,200kcal

\* I will incorporate creatine into my diet

\* I look into Sports massages but not sure if that helps.

I'm at this point clueless and don't want to cut back on my exercise but I'm right now actually scared of training my legs because it means half of my week will just be completely gone.

I'm glad for any advice no matter how outlandish. <3

1dkztlz,xxfitness,"Four day split, tired and hungry","For most of this year I've been trying to up my three day full body workout to a four day split (arms/legs). These workouts are 45m -1hour long and I'm going fairly heavy, as in, I've been experimenting for quite a while with heavier weights and lower reps. I feel like I can do three times a week fairly easily (up from two this time last year) but as soon as I try and do four, a couple weeks in, sometimes quicker, I hit a wall: incredibly hungry, persistent feelings of fatigue, joint pain and all round burn out. As in, struggling to get up in the morning.

I can't shake this feeling that maybe three days is my body's best, but is there something I could be missing that's stopping me from comfortably doing four days?

For context I'm 5', 119 pounds and I'm eating at the upper level of my typical calorie intake (about 1700 a day). I aim for and usually achieve 100-120g protein a day, with heaps of fruit and veges. I drink very little and theoretically I get eight hours sleep a night. My only other exercise is walking my dog twice a day but she's a bit of an ambler so I'm only hitting around 8000 steps a day (but that's just tracking off my phone, so could be higher), but usually a lot more on weekends. I do the stairs for 10 minutes before my lifting.

I take magnesium, mostly enjoy my job but it is stressful, have a good life, and don't have any known health issues. I skip my periods on the pill. Oh and I'm mid thirties! Would it be normal to be so tired hitting the gym four days a week and do you have any advice for possible diet tweaks, supplements, or any life hack!

  
Edit to add: thanks for the feedback everyone, it seems like the general consensus is to add calories. I have a huge mental block with this. Every time I think it's time to relax a little and up the calories and trust the process I panic. I will give it a go, look at maybe some creatine, and if I'm really knackered at the end of the week do some yoga or a longer walk instead. Thanks for all the thoughtful responses.

1c9tndn,xxfitness,How much money do you spend on fitness? ,"I've been a regular at my gym for almost a year paying $49 per month (paid more to have access to another location near work), but as of next month, I will be switching officially to Classpass which I can still use to access my gym. I enjoy running a lot for cardio and with the weather being so nice, I know I'd be spending more time running outdoors than at the gym which was one of the main reasons I was cancelling my membership.

Having tried a couple different fitness classes which I loved, the idea of having more flexibiity and variety plus still being able to go to my regular gym through Classpass just made more sense for my schedule. Having friends who want to work out at their gyms with guest passes definitely influenced my decision as well.

This year so far:

* Classpass ($89/month..recommend taking advantage of the free trial period trial. Love taking Barry's classes and looking to try different pilates studios as well.)
* Orange Theory (20 class pack for $380 = $19/class)
* Gym outfits (\~$130)
* Supplements (\~$150..mostly post-workout hydration/electrolytes and trying different protein beverages this year)
* Race fees (\~$240 as of April)

I'm curious to see what other folks spend on average on fitness (gym, equipment, clothing, classes, subscriptions, supplements, etc.) here and what have you found to be worth it/not worth it in your experience.",2024-04-21 21:44:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1c9tndn/how_much_money_do_you_spend_on_fitness/
1c7u5j9,xxfitness,What fitness myths/scams have you fallen for over the years?,"Thought this could be a fun spot to learn from each other's past mistakes, and ask questions for anyone who maybe didn't realize a certain thing was a scam or not true.

I'll keep ""scam"" broadly defined - anything that's a waste of money given the cost or not evidence based (backed by science). Myth is anything that's just not true as a whole.

I'll start

Scam: I went down the supplement road and was taking like 5 different supplements for skin and workouts (including pre workouts). Literally only creatine and protein are helpful, and science based, in my situation. So much wasted money!

Myth: I really thought it was possible to put on muscle way faster than realistic, and that's partially why I got into supplements. I wasn't eating or sleeping enough, so if course I wasn't seeing fast improvement. Women only get around 1lb of muscle gain per month under ideal circumstances. There was no way I was going to build a butt in 3 months while under eating when it's literal years of work for many.

Myth: Needing to cycle exercise with the menstrual cycle. According to current evidence most women benefit from continuing to workout throughout their cycle and it can actually help pain. Some individuals with more painful periods or cysts may need to further modify due to individualized medical need, but for most women with normal periods there is no benefit to cycling and it's unnecessarily reducing workout load. Other factors like sleep and diet tend to be more impactful. The more I've looked into this the more it falls under weird traditionalist/conservative ideologies. 

(I'm not saying we shouldn't modify if we need to, just saying that this is more of a medical accomodation for women to consider, like going gluten free because of celiac, rather than something all women should be doing just because of social media.)

Scam: Various social media influencer programs. Now I try to keep with people who seem 1. Like decent people, 2. Who are evidence based, 3. Ideally who are AFAB or women. No more supporting abusive men thank you.

I am currently taking the following supplements in these amounts and would like to ask - what do you think? Do you feel that anything needs to be changed? Anything to add or remove? Do you use them yourselves and what are your feelings about them?

Vitamin E - 250mg / day   
Vitamin C - 1000mg / day  
Vitamin D3 - 8,000 UI / day  
Magnesium glycinate - 200-400mg / day  
Selenium - 100ug / day

I am considering adding Omega-3 in supplement form once every few days (I also eat fish once every few days) and NAC (500mg) every day. What do you think about them? Do you use them?

 I've been using them for about two weeks, so I may not feel the full effects yet, which is why I'm asking for the future.

1mui1ly,Biohackers,[N=1] Cold showers surprised me more than any supplement stack,"I’ve tried a range of biohacks over the past year including different nootropic stacks, sleep tracking, and even a few neurofeedback sessions. Some things made small differences, but none of them stuck long-term.

My most noticeable change so far came from something basic: ending a normal shower with 30–60 seconds of cold water. I didn’t start this for a specific health condition, just as an experiment. For me, it had a clear effect on alertness and mood, more than many of the supplements I rotated through.

I’m not saying it works for everyone, but for my own routine it’s been more reliable than most of the expensive tools I’ve tried.

1mufaxi,Biohackers,I took magnesium every night for a week – here’s what I noticed,"Hi all

I have read a lot of articles lately about magnesium, so I decided to try supplementing with **233 mg magnesium hydroxide** every night for a week. I didn’t expect much — maybe slightly better sleep or something like that. I have tried multi vitamins, and several fitness supplements, and 99% of the time I don’t really feel any difference, and have thought most supplements to be a waste of money and time.

Anyone have better experience with specific supplement brands, or specific magnesium types?

Here is what I experienced:

On the positive side

* Woke up feeling… clearer in the morning (perhaps due to better sleep)
* Felt calmer during day and evening, not wired like usual after work.
* Sneaky bonus: fewer tension headaches (not a miracle—but noticeable, been having regular migraines for past 10 years, so any period without is amazing)

Negative side:

* Stomach cramps in the morning 3 of the days in the week I tried it. Don’t know if it has been due to the magnesium tablets I bought.

The supplement I tried: easy to find, inexpensive, and backed by some interesting studies on stress, sleep, and nervous system support.

Curious—has anyone else tried magnesium? What form did you use, and what did it do for you? Would love honest experiences 🤔

As something new, I am trying to share my experiences with everything I try on YouTube, as perhaps a better format than articles. I am not very good at it, but perhaps its a good way to communicate stuff like this.

1msy6xa,Biohackers,GLYNAC as a miracle drug?,"GlyNAC helps the body restore glutathione, a powerful natural antioxidant that declines with age, protecting cells from damage. It improves how mitochondria the cell’s energy factories work, leading to more energy, better strength, and faster walking in older adults. Studies also show it supports the brain, improving memory and thinking, and possibly lowering risk for Alzheimer’s. GlyNAC reduces inflammation and insulin resistance, which lowers risks tied to diabetes and heart disease. Finally, it has been shown to be safe and broadly beneficial, helping not only older adults but also people with HIV and age-related health issues. (Should have mentioned it’s a combination of two supplements not drugs, NAC + Glycine). 

TL;DR

Dose: ~100 mg/kg/day glycine + 100 mg/kg/day NAC (~7 g + 7 g daily for 70 kg adult).

Duration: Studies ran 2 weeks → 6 months. Most robust effects after 12–24 weeks.

Findings: Better muscle strength, walking speed, cognition, insulin sensitivity, and mitochondrial health.

Special cases: Helped older adults + HIV patients; early signs it may lower Alzheimer’s risk.

Caveat: Benefits only last while you’re on it & stop taking it, gains go away.

1mrs342,Biohackers,My biohacking journey as a middle aged overweight guy,"12 months ago I was very unhealthy - 123kg (271lb), cholesterol >8, elevated liver enzymes, hypertension. The typical lazy 40 year old white collar male. Desk job, no exercise, high stress, poor sleep, etc. my wife and I used to joke that I would die young from the ""trifecta"" - sedentary, high stress job, overweight. Except it wasn't really a joke. 

I made a new year's resolution to take control of my life and get healthy through biohacking. And I have gotten into it in a big way: 
- I quit alcohol entirely (easy as I was never a big drinker anyway)
- I quit caffeine entirely (toughest thing for me as I used to drink 2L of coke no sugar a day) 
- I completely changed my diet - cut out takeaway, hired a private chef to make all my meals. Protein and salads/veges all the way. 
- I hired a personal trainer and go every weekday. I've only missed 2 sessions in nearly 8 months, and I made them both up. We mainly do stretching and resistance training. 
- I bought a treadmill and got a gym membership. I do 1 hour of cardio and extra resistance training every weekday, and sometimes on weekends as well (2 hours total between PT and Gym/Cardio)
- I overhauled my sleep - I used to sleep 4ish hours a night (for 10+ years). Now I sleep 8 hours a night every night. 
- a daily post workout shake for various things - protein for muscle development, collagen for hair/skin/joints, dextrose for a carb hit/glycogen replenishment, creatine for muscle recovery, psyllium husk for fibre and cholesterol absorption, Trimethylglycine for heart brain and liver health
- I started taking targeted supplements for overall health and to try and to try and help with my hip osteoarthritis - a multi, DHA/EPA, hyaluronic acid, CoQ10, type 2 collagen, zinc, MSM+chondroitin+glucosamine, phosphatadyl serine, ashwaghanda (PS +Ash to lower cortisol)
- various peptides for different benefits. BPC-157 & TB-500 for recovery. Tirzepatide for weight loss. CJC-1295 & Ipamoerlin for muscle growth. MOTS-C and AICAR for mitochondrial health/AMPK activation. GHK-Cu for skin health. ARA-290 for anti inflammatory.
- blood tests every 8 weeks to provide data to test and adjust dosages and mitigate risk 

It has been a series of smaller changes that cumulatively have completely changed my life. In 8 months:
- I have lost 30kg (66lb) so far and am still going. 
- My total cholesterol has dropped to 5 without statins.
- The hypertension is completely gone - stress echo shows perfect heart health. 
- Visceral fat is pretty low. Even at 100kg my visceral fat was only 500g, confirmed via DEXA scan. I've lost 6kg since then. 
- cortisol has dropped from ~800 to ~300
- I've built ""lots"" of muscle - definitely no body builder but I'm happy with the amount of lean muscle I've been able to build while in a long term calorie deficit
- I feel better, am more confident, more emotionally stable, and less volatile. Things that would upset me previously now don't bother me at all.

So, for a budding biohacker who has seen enormous benefits so far, what else can I do? What's next? 
- I've identified a few peptides that I think will benefit me, that are at a risk level that I am comfortable with: SS-31 for mitochondrial protection, Thymosin alpha 1 for immune support, epitalon for cellular health, glutathione for detox
- I've looked into red light therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. There are some places nearby that offer it at very reasonable rates and it seems like it might have some benefits
- genetic testing seems like it could have some merit. Identifying key things relevant to me and my my risk factors

1mr82f2,Biohackers,Could a new coxsackie B virus that is infecting the general population be responsible for the major anxiety epidemic that manifested from around 2008 onwards? Many infectious microbes have been linked to anxiety,"Numerous studies have found a large increase in anxiety symptoms in younger people in over the last decade or two.

For example, a US [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7441973/) found that the number of adults aged 18 to 34 with anxiety increased by 1.8 times from 2008 to 2018.

A British [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8529638/) noted a doubling of the number of new diagnoses of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) in the 18 to 34 age group from 2008 to 2018.

And a Canadian [study](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2023001/article/00011-eng.htm) observed that in people aged 15 or older, the prevalence of GAD doubled from 2012 to 2022. The study found young people and young women were disproportionately affected, with the prevalence of GAD in women aged 15 to 24 tripling during this time period.

Many pundits suggest that social media may be behind this increase in anxiety; and certainly social media might play a role in raising anxiety levels.

However, I would like to propose another explanation: that a new virus in circulation among young people may be responsible for the anxiety epidemic.

Medical science is aware that infectious microbes can trigger mental symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Indeed, there are studies linking several microbes to anxiety, such as Toxoplasma gondii (a parasite that infects the brain and can be caught from eating undercooked meat), the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. If you want references for these studies, I can supply them.

But in addition to these known microbes associated with anxiety, I believe that there is a new virus in circulation causing anxiety. This is because back in 2003, I caught a virus (which blood tests indicated was coxsackievirus B4), and within weeks of catching it, the virus started affecting my brain, and caused lots of anxiety, which became a permanent long-term mental symptom. Not only that, but as my Coxsackie virus spread to friends and family, it suddenly triggered major anxiety symptoms in several people (and major depression in others). I believe these mental symptoms appear because this virus somehow affects the brain.

So I believe that the Coxsackie B4 virus I caught may be another virus that can trigger generalised anxiety disorder, even if science is not yet aware of it. Thus I wonder if this virus might be behind the anxiety epidemic in Gen Z.

For more information about how this Coxsackie B4 virus I caught triggered generalised anxiety disorder in multiple people who contracted it, see my website [here](https://thebraindegenerationvirus.wordpress.com). My website also details how to accurately check for coxsackievirus B4 via a blood test.

Incidentally, for me personally, the anxiety symptoms induced by this CVB4 virus were greatly ameliorated within two hours by the supplement N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG), which has calming effects on neurons. More details in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1i8pbxr/remarkably_powerful_antianxiety_effects_from_the/).

I ride horses competitively almost daily, lift heavy (usually legs) twice a week, do hot yoga 3-4 times a week, and run 3-4 days a week. My goals (like most women in 2025) are to build muscle in my legs and glutes while maintaining a slim waist and toned upper body. I’ve also been struggling a bit with mental health lately and have been super emotional since getting my birth control (Nexplanon) replaced. 

So basically looking for supplements that will help build muscle, lose fat, help with recovery, boost/stabilize my mood, and a good electrolyte recommendation.

1kh1gtf,healthyeating,Superfoods to improve your Athletic Performance,"I put together a list of 10 science-backed foods that can help you to build muscle, boost endurance, and recover faster. In my opinion these are the best food choices to improve your athletic performance without spending a ton on supplements.

Food to boost Energy:

Sweet Potatoes – Low glycemic index for steady energy; rich in potassium, magnesium, and vitamin A to reduce cramps.

Quinoa – Complete protein with all 9 essential amino acids; high in fiber, iron, and B vitamins; slow-release carbs for sustained energy.

Bananas – Provide quick and sustained energy; high in potassium and magnesium to prevent cramps; improve endurance (supported by studies, cyclists who ate bananas during their rides performed 5% better).


Food to improve Endurance and Recovery

Leafy Greens (Spinach, Kale) – High in nitrates to boost blood flow and oxygen delivery; reduce fatigue and inflammation.

Beets – Improve endurance via nitrates and nitric oxide; reduce oxygen cost of exercise; best consumed as juice 90 mins pre-workout.

Berries – Packed with antioxidants and vitamin C; reduce oxidative stress and muscle damage; support immune health and digestion.


Muscle Building Foods:

Wild Salmon (and other omega-3-rich fish) – Reduces inflammation; supports muscle growth, heart, and brain health; opt for wild-caught.

Eggs – Complete, highly bioavailable protein; contain healthy fats and B vitamins; ideal for muscle repair and growth.

Is this just the reality of the situation or do you have suggestions for smaller volume foods (ideally lower calorie, too) that have a lot of fiber? I am also amenable to fiber supplements- powders, gummies and the like. ",2025-02-07 00:28:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1iji3zg/efficient_ways_to_eat_more_fiber/
1ifgjls,healthyeating,Organised but boring,"For the first time ever I have sorted out my eating so that it’s healthy and easy. I put all the foods I’m eating into Cronometer and pleasantly found out I wasn’t missing out on any nutrients so I was very happy with that!

The only problem is that it’s very basic!! It goes like this…

For starchy carbs:-
Cook a massive batch of white rice and keep 4 portions to eat and freeze another 12 x 150g portions for the rest of the month. This is made the Persian way so it is very tasty rice!
Cook a batch of baby potatoes twice a week which gives me 8 portions.

For protein:-
Rump steak
Chicken breast
Venison steak
Tuna steak
Wild caught salmon

For veggies:-
Frozen bags of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, peas etc etc all take 5 mins to defrost.

Breakfast mon - Fri:-
Prep 5 x overnight oats with:- oats, milk, yogurt, kefir, chia seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, goji berries, sesame seeds, scoop of whey, salt.

Lunch mon - Thu:-
Prep 4 x pasta salad (3 variations - tuna, chicken, egg)

Breakfast weekends:-
Scrambled eggs on toast with a protein shake

Lunch wekends:-
Have carbs, protein, veggies mix and match from above.

Morning supplements:-
500ml water with 5g creative + ELMT electrolytes

Evening supplements:-
2 x omega 3 tabs
1 x vit d tab

2 black coffees a day.

Protein shake and banana if my workout doesn’t fall before a meal time.

Exercise routine:-
Mon - lower strength training (alternating between heavy weights and low weights each month)
Tue - upper strength training (same as above)
Wed - treadmill sprints
Thu - long zone 2 run
Fri - rest
Sat - limb strength training (biceps, triceps, calf’s, neck)
Sun - rest

I’ve got myself into such a routine I can knock up a healthy meal, eat and clean up in less than half an hour.

I’ve been through the motions with diets and have tried keto, carnivore and other particular diets, but now I’m very balanced I hit the following macros:-
Protein 200g
Carbs 150g
Fat 80g
Something along them lines it ends up being about 2100 calories a day, this has resulted in about 8kg lost in two months, I’m very pleased with that!

I put the success down to the fact I finally made myself responsible for my own diet, rather than expecting my wife to keep up with my requirements (which hasn’t gone down well in the past).

I went round a neighbours for dinner last night and had a few beers, some lovely food and a bit of dessert all guilt free because of how well I’m doing and how confident I am of getting back on the wagon the next day!

Anyways, this is all great, but I need to make the menu a bit more exciting and varied without making it harder and less likely for me to stick to my good ways!! 

Any ideas?",2025-02-01 21:13:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1ifgjls/organised_but_boring/
1iakqud,healthyeating,Questions about vegetable replacement.,"I am about to turn 29 and feel I should try to eat healthier. I am reducing sugar and getting more exercise. I know I don't get nearly enough vegetables. Unfortunately due to my autism the taste and texture of most vegetables is like torture to me. I am looking for ways to get the nutrients my body needs than I can actually stand to do. I am a man and my weight is not currently an issue but I plan on keeping it that way.

What exactly are the nutrients I need from vegetables?

I have read that vegetable juice can't replace whole vegetables because of fiber. If i get my fiber from grain will that work? Is there any other reason vegetable juice would not work?

I have also read that vegetable replacement supplements don't work because supplements alone don't absorb well. If took them while eating normal food would that help? Is there any reason I could not completely replace vegetables with supplements?

I do like seasonings like garlic powder. What are some seasoning with a lot of vegetable nutrients?",2025-01-26 17:38:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1iakqud/questions_about_vegetable_replacement/

I take stuff like liposomal vitamin C, black seed oil, fish oil (Nordic Naturals brand), b-complex, NAC, Zinc carnosine and etc every day. I've wasted too much money on supplements that don't work and too much each month on the ones that do. I've also started eating a healthy salad each day as well. Romaine lettuce, broccoli sprouts, microgreens, feta cheese, berries, and sometimes a little bit of organic chicken if I am making that salad a meal. Oh and I use balsamic vinaigrette as my dressing as I read its the healthiest dressing you can use. I also added 1 tablespoon of black sesame seeds per day, I just dumb the tablespoon of them in my mouth and chew em up and swallow. They actually taste really good. So anyways. 


I just started taking psyllum husk powder (fiber) about 5 days ago and just after 2-3 days of taking 1 to 2 teaspoons daily I feel so much better. Just taking this extra fiber has given me better benefits then all those supplements above I mentioned combined. Its amazing that taking just some extra fiber has given me such great results, plus its cheap. My bowel movements are now way better. Ever sense I started every #2 I have is ghost #2, meaning when I wipe there is nothing on toilet paper. I have much more energy as well. I know its the psyllium husk powder doing this because that is the only thing I added to my supplement stack. Just saying sometimes the most effective supplement is the most simple one. In my case it was just extra fiber.

1cuhaou,healthyeating,Why avocado boost me like this ?! ,"Avocado 🥑  “Specially large hass mexican” or american
, While African Avocado has no effect on me




There is no food boost my brain like it … prob this then dark chocolate… everything else is way way lower … 

If I eat in the morning with EV olive oil and boiled eggs ;

I am Filled with excitement , positivity, joy, feeling of well being , and being motivated, I feel a live “and its very noticeable feeling” , everything becomes more interesting than its 



No other food gave me this effect and my diet is 90-95% healthy !!

Why ?? 🤔

====_______________====

If I eat Avocado with those after 16 hours fasting , I feel high ;

- Olives
- 4, or 5 Boiled eggs
- 2 tbsp EV olive oil
- Boiled and Roasted chicken breast
- Salad
- little of Pumpkin seeds
- Pecan Nutts 
- Carlson omega 3 oil The very Finest 5-8ml “Beginning of the meal”

I feel alive and feel optimistic, positive and extremely happy and its a rush of happiness with huge smiles 😄 that comes into waves , one after the other after the other … without any stop at all !!

Imagine you have huge smiles like maybe 30 times in a row or above , and every 3-6 seconds or so, one pops out its like into waves with pure happiness every time !! And every smile its huge and euphoric like you never had ever the same smile before in your entire life !! And it feels so good !!

I never had this in my life !! 

 I remembered I smile for 25-30 min straight while I try to resist not to smile but I couldn’t take my huge smile away 😀… I tried my best to stop but I couldn’t !!

Its not you that I want to smile … 
its like your brain 🧠 is making and forcing you to have a huge smile and feel very euphoric and happy. 😀

Because these are two completely different things !! 

And it’s like you don’t really have any control at all whether to smile or not !!

====_______________====

So Food gave me happiness, joy with smile that lasted for 30 min !! That probably nothing in my life gave me this is really shocking to me

Even substances like Wxxx, alcxxxx , nicotine, Caffiene didn’t give me a that level of happiness that meal gave me that day … !!

I am really impressed and shocked as well … !! 😅

With good sleep, The day is tremendously better than my normal day for my mood … and I love it ❤️    With those things !!

Cold shower , Coffee , Dark Chocolates 88-92% , avocado , banana, pumpkin seeds , beef or steak , eggs , olives oil, green leafy and vegetable salad, jogging or Running. Omega 3 oil and vitamin D3 supplements 

The best days I felt in this year was a combination of those to be in my day !!

====_______________====

First Question:

So why it does have this effect on me ?! And what are neurotransmitters are more likely involved in this one ?! 

====_______________====

Second Question ; 

Does avocado have vitamins and micro nutrients that I am more likely deficient in … and is that the reason I am feeling the effect more so or not ?! Or are these effect happening to everyone when they eat avocado 🥑 ?!

Because if that is the case I will try to use supplement or focus more on getting it from my diet ?!

1caelpq,healthyeating,"Rate my diet (18M, 178cm, need to bulk)","When I was little I always had a very low appetite and there were days where I was ""able"" to eat a single moderate meal+when I started working out I had a chaotic workout program, not having a single pause between sets (chest->back->legs, repeat), that insane cardio and that low calorie intake (they surely were days where I had under 1000kcal per day) led to me having very little mass. October 2023 I had only 54kg, I tried donating blood but wasn't able to, I had already tried bulking for the past year to some extend, but that event really hit a spark in me.

Fast forward, I really ate a lot per day, not necessarily a good, diverse diet, but it still was lot, so much that there were several days when I was feeling like vomiting, and I currently have 59kg, although at the beggining of 58kg the progress got really, really slowed. Point is, things with a lot of calories from simple sugars REALLY affected my overall mood and thinking for certain periods, for that reason, I limited my simple sugars to strictly natural sources, occasionally honey. I also remarked that junk food which contained MSG, unhealthy fat and others additives made me crave them into more, temporary impairing my thinking and clearance of mind.

Apart from sugar and addictive additives which I already know created cravings, therefore impairing my clearance of mind and mood, I started feeling in a lot of horrible ways, and I suspected it was from some kind of vitamin deficiency. I started taking a lot of supplements (feeling that especially Omega-3 and Ashwaganda helped the most) and concentrated more on taking protein after work-outs and having a good amount of protein per day.

My ""plan"" was this, please critique it as much as there is to critique:  
So, apart from high-calorie junk-food, eating to gain weight would also mean getting more body-fat, which isn't what I really wanted since I barely made out of the skinny-fat problem two years ago, plus I run, a lot, so more body fat wouldn't benefit me too much. I researched about what happens with extra-protein and when would it be considered ""extra"", and I drawed the conclusion that while my first interest was to gain weight, I would rather like not gaining useless body fat while feeling horrible and then do a cut, but just increase the muscle mass. Muscle density is higher than body fat density, therefore my overall volume can be the same, but with more mass. Therefore there are several days where I take 100g+ of protein per day, usually the days when I work out, even though it can be just 2 sets.

Currently, I am happy with my diet of 2000kcal+ per day, 80g of protein+ per day, no junk food and no added sugar, also no feeling horrible for whatever reason, but is it enough, is it too much, and can it potentially lead me to any long-term problems?

Diet:  
-daily  
2-3 eggs in the breakfast with varying type of bread, alternating the cooking oil with EV Coconut oil, EV Olive Oil and animal fat if available (sometimes with dill, parsley and tomatoes)  
50-100g of nuts per day (either pure nut butter from almonds, cashews and hazelnuts, either simple nuts as snacks, including pumpkin and sunflower seeds)  
600ml-800ml of milk per day/kefir  
50g of whey protein/casein (with added bromelain and digestive enzymes)  
50-100g of sorghum porridge  
2g of grounded cinnamon (in the protein shake)

-some times per week  
meat, mostly poultry, rarely red meat  
fruits, especially bananas and citrus  
teas, mostly white tea and other real teas, occasionally herbal  
cereals and wholegrains other than sorghumchia seeds  
any kind of cheese  
honey in coffee or tea

-some times per month  
potatoes (in any way)  
chicken soup, usually with organs  
if in need of flour to cook something, chickpea flour  
mac and cheese with a personalized mix which includes nutritional yeast  
mung beans  
white rice  
whatever my parents make me, usually meat with some kind of side dish with legumes or pasta

Supplements:  
Omega-3 (daily)  
Vitamin D (daily)  
Multivitamin (C, E, B1,2,3,5,6,7,9,12 , Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, Selenium) (sometimes per week)  
Ashwaganda (daily)  
Chlorella (I take 1-3 times per week, to detox the possible heavy metals from the diet or supplementation)

I drink a lot of water daily, also I have no digestive problems, the digestive enzymes, kefir and sorghum porridge takes care of the hardship of digesting fats.

Is there something I am missing in my diet? Will I have any long-term problems with the current diet I have?  
I saw that what I mostly spam for calories has the negative impact on weight gain, leading to other types of problems, but does it apply when I was severely underweight to begin with?

16erlfu,healthyeating,I need to validate this idea with you!,"Would you pay for an online medical lab interpretation service that provides natural medicine recommendations tailored to your lab data and insights from your health history form, rather than just taking pharmaceuticals for your health condition?

  
**How it works is:**

  
1. You would **upload your labs anonymously** (erasing all personal identifiers-name, address, phone, etc). Your labs are preferably less than a year old. You can also order new labs with your insurance (just like at any doctor’s clinic). There are ""functional"" labs which are typically out of pocket (HSA/ FSA can be applied)  
2. **Fill out a comprehensive health history form** (without any personal identifiers), and  
3. **Receive personalized diet/ food recommendations, herbal regimen and supplements with details such as when to take, how much, how often, side effects, drug-herb interactions, and more.** These recommendations would be for a whole month and you would receive the recommendations within a few days. Natural medicine doctors (Naturopathic), functional medicine providers, and integrative docs would be behind crafting this custom recommendations, which you can also use to collaborate with your primary care doc.  
4. **Consultations are optional.**  
5. You can also order functional labs without doctor's orders and without paying for an appointment.

  
I have a medical background and meeting people on a 1:1 basis to guide them to their optimal health is the best part of my job, however, I would like to know if there are people that would like the easy accessibility, low cost of service (less than an initial doctor's visit), no waiting rooms, or scheduling an appointment, and anonymity of their health data. The other reason I thought of this is also so that people get accurate medical facts, evidence-based research rather than spend countless hours on the internet looking for their health solutions which may or may not be verified.

  
Please provide any feedback regarding this. Would you use something like this? How do you feel about consultations being optional? What other barriers do you see with this?

Here's an excerpt from Gretchen Reynold's story:  


**Active people need more protein than couch potatoes**  


If you’re sedentary, you officially need about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, according to the recommended daily allowance set by the government’s Food and Nutrition Board. This translates to somewhere between 45 to 60 grams of daily protein for most people who rarely exercise — or approximately two chicken breasts (about 30 grams of protein each) or a 6-ounce can of tuna (about 40 grams) and a quarter-cup of almonds (about 8 grams).But this amount is almost certainly too low for many of us. The recommendation “for protein might be enough to keep us alive, but it is too low for physically active people,” said Eric Rawson, a professor of nutrition and exercise at Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pa.

For active people, a better recommendation would be “1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram” of body weight each day, Phillips said, or higher, “up to a level of 1.6 grams per kilogram” of body weight daily if you’re physically active. In simple terms, if you weigh 160 pounds, or 72.5 kilograms, then 1 gram per kilogram of your weight is 72.5 grams of daily protein, which you could get by eating, over the course of your day, a 6-ounce steak (about 42 grams), a cup of Greek yogurt (about 17 grams) and a half-cup of tofu (about 20 grams).

Some researchers advocate for more, though, especially for athletes in the middle of heavy training, when their muscles are under constant strain. For them, the “optimal” amount of protein may be as high as 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight every day or approximately a gram of protein for every pound of body weight, said Shawn Arent, the chairman of the department of exercise science at the University of South Carolina and a longtime sports nutrition researcher.  


**You don’t need that whey shake.**  


Still concerned about getting enough protein? Supplements, like shakes and bars “are convenient,” Phillips said. But so is a hard-boiled egg, which contains about 6 grams of protein, or a chicken breast. “I eat a lot of Greek yogurt and chicken,” he said.

There’s little evidence that certain proteins are more nutritious than others, although some people swear by whey powder. Derived from milk, whey is a good source of leucine, an amino acid that helps jump-start muscle building. “But so is Greek-style yogurt,” Phillips said, or salmon, which is packed with leucine.

“Whey protein has falsely been put on a pedestal as superior due to aggressive sports marketing campaigns,” Burd said.

Most people, including athletes, can get sufficient protein without needing powdered whey, even if they don’t eat meat.

“Vegetarian and vegan athletes can easily meet protein needs on a plant-based diet,” said Enette Larson-Meyer, the director of the Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism Laboratory at Virginia Tech and co-author of Plant-Based Sports Nutrition.

Plant proteins may not be complete, she said, meaning they don’t contain all the amino acids we need, but “consuming a combination of different plant-based protein sources, such as beans and grain, will provide a balanced protein profile.” If your diet is plant forward, but not fully vegetarian, add an egg or some cheese to improve a mostly vegetarian dish’s “amino-acid profile,” she said.",2023-05-25 18:07:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/13rosie/what_to_know_about_protein/
12mu2kk,healthyeating,Protein benefits? Protein for weight loss & weight gain,"

I got to know exactly about the protein, how exactly it works & it is beneficial for both weight loss and weight gain. This is not a advertisement, it’s just I’m sharing my knowledge which was beneficial for me hope it will be helpful for you guys….

Protein is a macronutrient that is essential for building muscle mass. Protein is commonly found in animal products, though it is also present in other sources, such as nuts and legumes. There are a total of three macronutrients: Protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Macronutrients provide calories or energy to the human body.

Protein Benefits

1. Protein for your body

Your body needs protein to stay healthy and work the way it should. More than 10,000 types are found in everything from your organs to your muscles and tissues to your bones, skin, and hair. 

2. Protein for good & healthy skin

Protein is essential for generating healthy skin and nails. The collagen and amino acids found in whey protein help maintain skin elasticity and firmness.

3. Protein for weight loss

By replacing carbs and fat with protein, you reduce the hunger hormone and boost several satiety hormones. This leads to a major reduction in hunger and is the main reason protein helps you lose weight. It can make you eat fewer calories automatically.
That’s how protein helps for weight loss in a healthy way!

4. Adding Protein to your daily diet is amazing

Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. Proteins do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs.

“It is important for individuals to consume protein every day.

5. Protein for your sexual lifestyle

Eating meats, or other foods that contain specific amino acids, could help improve your sex life. Various high-protein foods — including beef, chicken, and pork — contain compounds that help to improve blood flow, such as carnitine. L-arginine.

6. Protein for weight gain

There are many types available, including whey, soy, egg, and pea protein. Whey protein supplements and mass gainers (supplements that can help you gain muscle mass) can be very easy and cost-effective strategies to gain weight, especially when combined with strength training.

Potatoes: they're a better option than cereals (wheat, rice, corn) and provide fewer calories per 100 grams. They have fiber, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, C, high potassium, and some minerals and tiny amounts of all esential aminoacids). At the same time, potatoes can replace flour in order to avoid all those chemicals and ""enrichments"".

Chard: it has high amount of Vitamins A, C, E, K, fiber and mineral traces with little calories.

Eggs: they're cheaper than meat and cheese, and their organic version is cheaper than organic meat too, while they provide B12, nice fat and nice sterols (HDL), and enough protein. It's actually the perfect protein. They have only 155 calories per 100 grams. Having into account that they provide B12, it's nice. Plus: it doesn't necessarily include animal suffering.

Flax seeds: They provide Omega 3, omega 6, and lots of fiber. It's a good, cheap seasoning.

Supplements: Magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium chloride. They are all cheap.",2022-12-15 02:25:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/zm9m46/what_are_some_of_the_most_nutrient_dense_foods/
yn2n4v,healthyeating,"Top 10 sports supplements: what, who, and for what","The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) stresses that the basis of a good training and high-performance program is a healthy, nutrient-rich diet.

What role does sports nutrition play in this and is it really necessary? Analysis by MedAboutMe.

## What is sports nutrition?

Sports supplements are now a multi-million dollar industry. Athletes and people with active lifestyles come after attractive advertising from marketers. They promise high performance, increased strength and stamina, increased muscle mass, an endless source of energy, and help with weight loss.

Experts estimate that between 39% and 89% of the international sports supplement market is used by elite and older fitness athletes. At the same time, the lack of quality control of nutritional supplements, as well as clear requirements for their composition, leads some people to take ineffective products.

According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only a small fraction of nutritional supplements that promise benefits in sports are confirmed in clinical studies. Many supplements, despite their high price, do not guarantee safety and are ineffective in improving sports performance.

## How should an athlete eat?

People who participate in sports must have a balanced diet containing sufficient quantities of all the nutrients necessary for health. At the same time, scientific studies show that a balanced diet cannot always meet the needs of a person who engages in intense physical activity.

""The study of the diet of athletes of both sexes has shown a deficiency of one to several essential vitamins and minerals in the diet,"" explains Daniel Gastelou, physical trainer and expert in nutritional supplements.

The important thing is that the athlete's daily menu is a variable component that changes according to the energy needs of the individual and the goals he or she sets at the time.

* Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for an athlete. The amount of carbohydrates in the diet is determined by the intensity of training and can vary from 45-65% of the total calories entering the body.
* Protein is responsible for the growth and recovery of an athlete's muscles. The body's protein requirements can range from 2 to 8 grams per kilogram of an athlete's body weight per day.
* Fat helps maintain the body's energy balance, regulate hormones, and restore muscle tissue. A 2018 study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends that athletes consume about 30% of their total calories from healthy fats.

## Most popular sports supplements

Here are several types of sports supplements. Some of them help to gain muscle mass, others help with weight loss and body fat ""burning"", and still others help with recovery after intense exercise.

It is important to keep in mind that a single intake of a nutritional supplement does not change anything in terms of health, sports nutrition is taken daily in short or long courses. How does it work? How not to get confused when choosing it?

### 1. Protein

Help fitness athletes to gain muscle mass and increase the relief of the body. They contain from 70 to 95% protein. There are several types of protein: whey, casein, egg, meat, and soy. All of them complement each other.

Experts believe that taking one type of protein will not give the same significant result as a mixture of several supplements at once. Usually, proteins are taken 2 to 4 times a day.

### 2. BCAA Complex

Combines 3 amino acids - isoleucine, valine and leucine. This ""troika"" represents about 40% of all essential amino acids present in the body's muscle tissue. During intense loads, their intake is consumed first, which explains the need for their intake. In addition to the fact that they contribute to the increase in muscle mass, they are involved in various biochemical processes.

You can take them in the morning after waking up, as well as before, during, and after training.

### 3. Winners

This name hides a mixture of protein (most often whey) with a carbohydrate complex. The ratio of carbohydrates to protein may vary depending on the manufacturer of the product. For some players, carbohydrates represent 1/2 of the weight of the product, for others, proteins represent 1/3 of the weight. Vitamins, enzymes, and other useful substances are often used as additional components.

Players usually take it once a day. Their main goal is a total body weight package (i.e. fat content as well as muscular mass).

### 4. Creatine

This is a natural substance found naturally in fish and meat: tuna, herring, salmon, and beef. It helps support muscle growth, promotes faster recovery after workouts, and improves strength performance.

Creatine is available in powder or capsule form for a single dose. The products are usually dissolved in sweetened fruit juice and drunk after training. After 4 weeks of use, advanced athletes recommend a 2-3 week break.

### 5. Amino acid complexes

These are commercially available in tablet, liquid, and capsule form. Unlike BCAAs, complex amino acids contain their full set of both essential and non-essential. These supplements help build muscle mass and increase strength. They are usually taken several times a day, such as in the morning, before and after training.

From the point of view of the advisability of taking amino acids, there are many opinions. But many experts are convinced that if an athlete consumes protein and gainers, amino acids cannot be taken. Otherwise, amino acids in the diet are highly desirable.

### 6. L-carnitine

This is a non-essential acid that in the body is found mainly in the liver and muscle tissue. Athletes are primarily interested in it as a fat-burning catalyst, as L-carnitine transports fatty acids to the cellular mitochondria. Another important quality of this supplement is that it provides extra energy for training.

It is usually taken twice a day - immediately after waking up and before training.

### 7. Omega-3

Polyunsaturated fatty acids have a range of health benefits. They stimulate muscle growth, protect joints and ligaments from overload, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and increase endurance. There is also evidence that they have a positive effect on testosterone synthesis.

A common source of omega-3 is fish oil, familiar to many from childhood. However, essential fatty acids can also be purchased in their pure form - as sports nutrition or pharmaceutical preparations. Take supplements 2 to 3 times a day with meals.

### 8. Fat burners

This is one of the most controversial sports supplements, and the timeliness of taking it is still controversial among experts in the field. Marketers are convinced that such supplements ""burn"" the fat layer while leaving the muscle mass intact. The mechanism of their action is based on the stimulation of metabolic processes, a decrease in appetite, the elimination of fluids from the body, and an obstacle to the synthesis of fat.

Fat burners come in several forms: thermogenic (increase body temperature and metabolic rate), lipotropic (promote the breakdown of fat), blockers (prevent the absorption of fat and carbohydrates from food), and appetite suppressants.

### 9. Vitamin and mineral complexes

Their reception for athletes has long been the norm. They help meet the body's needs for essential nutrients. It is especially important to consume them during the cold season when the diet is depleted of vitamins and minerals.

Such supplements increase the general tone of the body and strengthen the immune system, contributing to rapid recovery after training. Take these with food once or twice per day.

### 10. Energy

This is the fastest way to generate a burst of strength and energy at the right time. Energy drinks relieve fatigue and increase concentration and focus. They usually contain guarana extract, caffeine, and other natural stimulants.

Energy drinks are produced in the form of powder to make drink, gel, and ready-to-drink versions.",2022-11-05 18:48:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/yn2n4v/top_10_sports_supplements_what_who_and_for_what/
yj2tnc,healthyeating,How healthy is my diet?,"Every morning for breakfast I have rolled oats (40g) with low fat milk (120g) and mixed berries (150g)

For lunch I tend to have 3 of the following foods depending on what I feel like or what I have in stock: 1/2 an avocado, a low fat yogurt, 15 almonds, a few slices of cheese, an apple and a banana. Once or twice a week I'll get two salmon avocado sushi rolls for lunch instead.

Dinner varies but is typically some kind of red meat (steak, pork/lamb chops) with broccoli, cauliflower, a carrot and a handful of peas. I also usually have baked salmon with veggies once a week, and a homemade chicken tikka masala with white rice once a week also. On Sundays I have a roast chicken with veggies and gravy. Fridays I allow myself a Chinese takeout and a white chocolate bar for dinner, a cheat meal.

I drink 3-4 litres of water a day, stay away from processed meat and junk food (except for Friday takeout/chocolate). I also take Zinc and collagen supplements in the morning, and after dinner I take a vit D and Omega 3 supplement. 

Just doing this with no exercise since January I've lost over 50 pounds, but I'm curious how nutritious and healthy this is, and what I can do to improve it.

vt29ri,healthyeating,Vitamin D supplements and their supporting role in bone health Has the pandemic had a negative effect on your outdoor life style?,"Millions of people have spent more time indoors these past two years than ever. Due to spending more time indoors than in the past, people are lacking Vitamin D. The lack of vitamin D has been shown to cause bone weakness which can lead to osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and bone density decrease. Vitamin D, along with calcium, absorbs into the bones to promote strength and protection. Not getting enough vitamin D puts you at risk for many other diseases such as heart disease and high blood sugar as well. Finding a solution to this problem is of utmost priority, as bone density loss is a growing problem across the world.   Vitamin D is a hormone essential for calcium absorption and bone mineralization. A Vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia in adults. Osteomalacia is softening of one’s bones, this is most commonly caused by low levels of vitamin D. Osteomalacia is also considered the adult form of Rickets. Rickets takes place in children. This occurs when the child has a Vitamin D deficiency. Their bones are softened, distorted, and most of the time, bow inwards. They need medications, increase in Vitamin D in their diets, and in some cases, surgery. Another condition, like osteomalacia, is osteoporosis, which stops your bones from creating more bone mineral since some is lost. This causes your bones to become brittle and puts you at risk of fractures from things as simple as bending over. Bone density is gradually lost after peak bone mass is reached. This usually happens around ages 50-70. These conditions are most commonly diagnosed using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The DEXA scan works by sending two low dose X-rays, these two X-rays are absorbed differently by bone and tissue. The density profiles that are a result of this test, can then be used to calculate bone mineral density. There are also less common conditions, such as rickets in children.  There is also an increase in bone fractures when there is a Vitamin D deficiency.   A large group of 379 adults from northeast England that were aged 70 years or older, were randomly assigned to three groups of different doses of vitamin D. One group received 12,000 IU, The second group received 24,000 IU, and the last group received 48,000 IU. Each dose was given once a month for 12 months. A dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry was used to measure the bone mass density at the participants hip. They measured each participant’s hip BMD before the experiment for a baseline and at the end of the experiment. The participants had to be 70 years of age or older, from northeast England. The participants could not have had an antiresorptive or anabolic treatment for osteoporosis in the previous three years. They could not have been taking a current supplementary vitamin D of greater than 10 micrograms or a calcium dose of greater than 500 mg/d. The participants could not have experienced a fragility fracture in the past 6 months. Each participant could not have a history of renal stones, previous bilateral hip replacements, or primary hyperthyroidism. The participants could not have a past or present history of hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml. There was no change in bone density after the 12 months of taking the vitamin D supplement. But there was also no decrease in the participants bone density, which may also be seen as a positive. The benefits outweigh the downsides because at the end of the experiment researchers found that the participants had an increase in plasma. Since there was no change then this study shows no association.   One of the studies shortcomings is that the study was done in Northeast England, which has different amounts of sunlight that the U.S., so the results are hard to compare to Americans’ different amounts. Another flaw in the study design is that they allowed patients who already take a daily vitamin D supplement to continue to take that daily vitamin throughout the experiment along with their dose each month. Having the patients take a daily vitamin D supplement along with a higher dose monthly vitamin D supplement could possibly skew the results.   Another shortcoming was that this study shows no association between a higher or lower dose and amount of bone mass density in the different spots on the recipients. Along with this, it does not have a large group of participants in the study. There could have been a wider variety of ethnic groups and cultures. Different ethnic groups would probably have a different outcome as some may have more or less Vitamin D in their lifestyle coming into this study.    Vitamin D is absorbed orally from food and supplements and/or from the sun. We absorb Vitamin D from the sun through the skin. Our skin absorbs UV B radiation, which is then converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is created through the UV rays interacting with our skin’s protein, 7-DHC. Vitamin D through food and supplements is absorbed through the small intestine, with the help of simple diffusion. Vitamin D has many imperative rolls in your body such as regulation of calcium absorption, immune system function, and growth of bones. All of these rolls help improve blood sugar levels, lower risk of certain cancers, and decrease risk of depression. About 42% of Americans are Vitamin D deficient, So you are probably wondering, is this curable? Luckily, it is! Doctors treat this condition by prescribing vitamin D supplements, and an increase in sunlight. For more severe cases like osteoporosis and osteomalacia are usually cured with a weekly pill and diet modification. Because these conditions are more serious, they take more time to cure. Sadly, osteoporosis can never be fully reversed, just managed and one can build up some bone strength, but it can never fully go away. Osteomalacia, however, can be healed in 6 months, but sometimes longer.   Peak bone mass is reached by age 25. The years leading up to this time are very important, because if you do not reach your peak then you are putting yourself at risk for osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and vitamin D deficiency later in life. The greater the peak bone mass, the greater protection from these dangerous conditions you have. As these conditions are seeing an increase across the world, as adults we should see this as a warning. This is also why children are more susceptible to breaking bones, along with being clumsy and foolish. While we do need to spend time in the sun and exercise, we should also take the precautions to not make dumb mistakes or accidents that put us at risk of damaging our bones, especially at the ends of each, as those are still growing. You may have heard of breaking at the bone plate, which can stunt growth. As one grows, the vitamin D is extremely helpful to continue to grow bones at the bone plates, which continue to develop until 16-18 years of age. While bones stop growing, the density continues until middle/late 20s, typically around year 25.",2022-07-06 22:18:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/vt29ri/vitamin_d_supplements_and_their_supporting_role/
sm0nkp,healthyeating,Immune system seems to be struggling after quitting dairy,"So I had to quit dairy, was having some pretty intense intestinal issues that went away as soon as I did so. But now I’m noticing that I get sick a lot more. And it’s starting to get on my nerves.

I’ve spent almost my ENTIRE 33 years of life with dairy as a staple. I was a huge milk drinker, many glasses a day. And now I’m guessing that I’m nutrient deficient somewhere after quitting.

What sort of supplements/vitamins can I take to make up for stopping dairy?

If you’re curious about my current diet, this is pretty much it, every day:

- Almond milk, unsweetened vanilla
- Lots of hard boiled eggs
- blueberries
- bananas
- Coffee
- Cinnamon Toast Crunch (lol)
- beef and white rice, no seasoning. Not everyday, trying to though
- white bread
- fresh green juice using 1 apple, 1 lime, half a cucumber, 3 celery sticks, and a good amount of kale 3-4 times a week.

I’m going to step the green juice up to twice a day for the next 7 days to see what happens. Also introduced those activia probiotic drinks recently",2022-02-06 16:25:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/sm0nkp/immune_system_seems_to_be_struggling_after/
qjaua1,healthyeating,Losing Weight 'Quicker' Compared to Losing Weight 'Quickly',"I always talk about how people should focus on losing weight 'quicker' instead of 'quickly'. This is because the former is way more realistic than the latter.

'Quicker' helps you to speed up a healthy process. 'Quickly' makes people tend to want to cut corners in an unhealthy manner.

Get it?

So, I just wanted to share some healthy resources that I literally go to daily. They're meal plans/recipe sources, diet resources, exercise resources, supplements, etc., in essence, the whole gambit, all in one spot.

You can do a piecemeal or a comprehensive thing. It's all up to you.

One thing, though: You just have to be serious. Too many people talk about wanting results, but don't want to invest in those results monetarily or effort-wise.

*  Breakfast is the golden meal, you must do it
*  Avoid fatty foods
*  Drink water without waiting for thirst
*  Make sure to compensate for electrolyte and mineral loss
*  Do not be exposed to direct sunlight between 12 and 15 o’clock

\- shallots 

\- cabbage (if it's in the right form) 

\- garlic / ginger / other things like this that add taste

aqfdwz,Wellness,Sleep Hygiene 101,"Sleep can have a major impact on one’s health and ability to function day to day, yet many people do not get enough. How often at work or school do you hear people complaining about not getting enough sleep or even worse, bragging about how little they got? The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0215-enough-sleep.html) has previously reported that 1 in every 3 American’s do not get enough sleep and other sources claim even higher statistics. So, what you do need to do if you want to fix your sleep situation?
     
     
**Sleep Routine**
     
If you have to get up for work at 5 am during the weekdays, you should not spend every weekend staying up all night and sleeping in past noon. That is not to say you can’t have late nights and/or sleep in, especially if you are feeling run down and can use the extra sleep, but you should not be doing it every weekend. Once you get yourself use to a set routine, you will have an easier time going to bed at night and feel more refreshed and awake in the morning.

**Caffeine**

   
The effects of caffeine can often be felt for 6+ hours depending on your sensitivity and amount drank. The [Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine](http://jcsm.aasm.org/viewabstract.aspx?pid=29198) reported a study that drinking coffee within 6 hours of going to sleep can have negative effects on your overall sleep. If you struggle to fall asleep at night and are a fan of caffeine, cut back on the total amount of caffeine you drink as well as how late in the day you drink it. Try to avoid having caffeine after noon and if you have to, aim for items on the lower end of the caffeine scale (tea for example). Everyone is different and genetics can play a big role in caffeine sensitivity, so play around with when you drink caffeine to see how it is affecting your sleep.

**Avoid the bed**
      
The bed should only serve two purposes, sleep and sex. Avoid laying down in the bed for anything else as it can sometimes cause the body to disassociated bed time with being awake doing something else. Do not lay down in bed to watch T.V or read. Go sit elsewhere and get away from the bed.

**Avoid Smoking/Alcohol**
       
Even though drinking may make you fall asleep (or pass out), it suppresses REM sleep which is vital for a truly restorative nights sleep. Many have experienced still feeling tired or groggy after a heavy drinking despite a full nights sleep. Smoking also may have a negative effect on REM sleep, but it also serves as a stimulant thus making it more difficult to fall asleep at night.



**Physical activity/inactivity**

For some people, exercising right before bed leaves them amped up and they struggle to fall asleep. For others, it does not matter. This can also be amplified by the use of pre-workout caffeine supplements. The key here is experiment and see how your body is affected. If you find working out stimulates you, do your workout earlier or get up earlier and work out in the morning. On the other side of the coin, a lack of physical activity can cause sleep issues (along with numerous other negative health consequences).


**Hunger**

For some people, going to bed hungry can make it extremely difficult to fall asleep. For others, a full meal that leaves them bloated makes them struggle to sleep. The key here is to know yourself and set up a system that works for you. If you know you get hungry at night, have later meals and/or plan to have a snack before bed. If you struggle with sleep due to feeling full, avoid late night food or figure out what foods trigger that feeling. Now, this advice is not saying make it a free for all with your food choices. If you are trying to control your weight/diet, pick things that fit in within your diet/calories. An apple before bed may be all you need.",2019-02-14 03:31:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellness/comments/aqfdwz/sleep_hygiene_101/

Making my own food- eating not necessarily “keto food” like Atkin bars or “sugar free Reese’s” 💰, but instead having a grass-fed beef Tenderloin with a side of blanched, french green beans, sautéed in butter with toasted sliced almonds, sea salt, and lemon 😋 for example, or a smoked wagyu brisket burnt ends (so good!) with jalapeño cheddar sausage and homemade roasted cauliflower florets brushed with smoked paprika butter, cotija cheese, and cilantro 🌿 
Btw, I used to scoff at anything cauliflower but it reminds me of tofu and it’s fun to get creative with it 💫 

I have severe adhd and this “diet”/way of eating helps my focus and basically it’s a filter to all the “negative” parts of my *condition* (not disorder) yet keeping the strengths (and there are strengths ☺️). 

I *love* getting my dopamine from learning, swimming, and socializing, and reading a really good book at night under my candlelights as I cozy up in my room drinking some herbal dessert tea (best tea ever for late nights), as opposed to getting my dopamine from eating chips and dip and subway and pizza while watching a mediocre movie. 

One of my fave things to do is go to the theater 🍿 🎥 And I know I’m in ketosis with my body and in my magical keto-mindset when I look forward to sneaking in my own homemade treats to the theater (I used to be obsessed with their super buttery popcorn) and feeling excited with not a hint of missing out as I get drinks and treats for my kiddo (I feel less bad overpaying for theater treats too ☺️). 

Granted I DO “ketofy” some things, like I do make my own pizza crust while family is eating Pizza Hut, yet I never feel deprived. I also am obsessed with making my own “Starbucks lattes” with Choczero syrups and extra focus supplements (like lions mane for example) but all these just add to my joy and love of being in control of my health not a victim of mass production; those conglomerations that thrive on keeping us addicted & sacrificing our health and money. They make us feel powerless in our bodies and it’s one of the worst feelings in the world to me……I LOVE feeling in control of this mind of mine (I’m vulnerable to mental health issues) and the only body I have in this lifetime (and I love my natural body). 

For me, it goes beyond just wanting to live longer since none of us knows how many days we’re given. It’s about the life within those days. The clarity, the focus, the freedom of energy I feel when my body is in ketosis. That’s what gives me vitality and joy. And yes…losing unnecessary weight and hearing people say, “You look amazing!”—well, that’s just the sprinkles on the cheesecake. 😘",2025-08-17 15:48:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1msue5f/i_love_being_in_control_of_my_health/

1moupbi,keto,potassium / sodium imbalance - miss you bananas,"Hey team. I've been in 1.5/4.0 ketosis for \~3 weeks. I'm active - boxing, weights, running, HIIT. Started out lean. Medical diet not weight loss.

Cronometer dings me every day for too little potassium and then again for too much sodium v. potassium.

I take electrolyte supplements to stay (barely) hydrated. Without them I get cramps and dizziness especially during workouts. They work great, but the ones I've found have way more sodium than potassium which just keeps pushing the imbalance in the wrong direction.

It also doesn't seem humanly possible to eat enough low-carb, potassium-rich foods to satisfy the Cronometer beast... just sketching it out I'd need something like salmon + 7 cups of spinach + 2 large avocados + 6 cups of bok choy + 5 cups mushrooms PER DAY. Wtf. And I understand that potassium supplements are regulated to small doses and just in general aren't recommended?

1mol0zw,keto,Doing Keto for Anxiety & Depression  - Looking for Advice,"Hello, I’ve been doing keto for about two months now, but it’s been a bit tricky since I don’t eat meat, fish, or seafood. My diet mostly consists of cheese, eggs, yogurt, some other dairy, and veggies. I’m also taking a bunch of supplements like multivitamins, magnesium, omega-3, garlic, Lion’s Mane, and a few others.

My main reason for starting keto is to help with my mental health, specifically generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression, which I’ve struggled with for several years. I’m currently on medications, vortioxetine and memantine (off-label for anxiety), plus I take Xanax for GAD.

So far, I haven’t noticed any significant improvements in my anxiety, depression, or overall mood. I have noticed some cognitive improvements, but it’s hard to tell if that’s keto alone since I also started using an infrared tPBM helmet twice a day around the same time, which seems to help with memory and cognition. But my anxiety and depression haven’t really improved.

I’m wondering if there are any supplements I could add that might help boost ketosis or improve the mental health benefits, like tributyrin-x or sodium butyrate? Or any tips for getting more out of keto on a vegetarian plan?

1mefps2,keto,Keto Bloat,"

Sorry about the long post but I want to provide enough detail to get advice that fits this situation, instead of people telling me to stop eating one food or another that I have been eating all my life with no bloating, ever.

I have been doing keto for a month.  I have already lost 21 pounds, started at 202 now at 180.7.  I have been really bloated very badly for the last week and a half even though I have been doing the same routine for almost 5 weeks, I am not sure if it's because I lost too much weight too quickly or because I my body is not prepared to eat so much fat.  I don't like fatty foods based on flavor, so I was eating 75% carbs, 20% protein and 5% fat all my life.  I never actually tracked it but that is my best guess.  I was eating mainly fruit and vegetables and junk like chips, ice cream, baked goods and candy.  I never had bloating in the past.  I do not eat anything new now, all the food I am currently consuming, I have been eating all my life just in different proportions.

I now track everything I eat approximately 1300 calories per day, the plan I created has about 1800 calories but I don't eat unless I am hungry and around 1300 calories seems to fill me.  I am usually around 68% fat 22% protein and close to 10% carbs.  I usually stay under 40g net carbs but total carbs fluctuates a lot because some days I eat over 30g of fiber and other days under 10.  I get between 2000 and 4000 mg of potassium depending on how much spinach I eat.  I haven't tracked sodium but I put salt on everything to make sure I get enough.  I bough electrolytes drops, but they are so sour salty and bitter I have not been able to keep them down/take more.  I Intermittent fast for 18 hours and eat for 6, usually 2 meals.



The foods I eat everyday now:

Steak, Chicken, Sardines, Sprats, Salmon, Eggs, Bacon, Shrimp, Tuna

Heavy Whipping Cream, Mozzarella Cheese, Kiefer

Broccoli, Spinach, Garden Salads, Chia Seeds, Raspberries, Brussels Sprouts

Supplements:

NAC, Berberine, Magnesium Glycinate, Zinc Vitamin D, Apple Cider Vinegar, MCT Oil a couple of times per week

All of these foods I have been eating all my life with no digestive issues of any kind.  I have not introduced anything new to my diet.  The bloating did not start immediately when I started Keto.  It started after 2-3 weeks and has progressively become worse.

I recently got a probiotic because I read that it can help with bloating but 7 days in no improvement.  I also take GASX but it is not very effective, I started doing ACV 30 minutes before eating also with no benefit, I think I actually start bloating from the ACV now as well not just after eating food.  Today I only ate 2 eggs and 2 bacon strips on purpose with no supplements except ACV, and was still really bloated after the small meal.

I don't think it's any specific food from the above list and my meals are pretty small since I am under 1400 calories and many days I will drink 2-3 shots of Heavy Whipping Cream after dinner because I don't have enough calories or fat grams, and I'm afraid that I will be kicked out of ketosis so I get about 400 calories from the cream or MCT Oil a couple of hours before bed that would make only 800 calories come from solid food.  I know for a fact that I am not allergic to dairy and HWC is not the problem.  I am a little bit more bloated on the days I eat 4 cups of spinach and 2 spoons of chia seeds but the difference is marginal, I am also bloated when I don't eat vegetables.

My best guess is my microbiome is not used to eating fat, I lost too much weight to quick or my body is still rebelling because it is missing it's 250 grams of carbs I used to eat everyday.

  
TLDR:  Bloated from every meal no matter if I eat only protein and fat or if I include vegetables.  I don't think it's the food I am consuming, may be I lost too much weight too fast, or my body is not used to eating 70% fat.

I could really use some help.

1mb58r2,keto,I'm really struggling with keto this time around.,"I'm not sure what to actually flair this post as, so I went with Help for now. 

This is my second time being on keto since 2019. I'm very well versed in the diet and had a huge amount of success with it from 2019 to 2021. During this time I lost around 100 lbs, and I felt amazing. I never got sick, never had any health issues, I brought my blood sugar from pre diabetic to normal levels. I improved almost every facet of my life and felt really good. I started at around 270 lbs and I got down to 170.

After 2021 I started to get lax on the no carb life  and eventually just fell off the wagon. I ended up back at around 230 lbs and have been now back on the wagon for the last month +. I have lost some lbs during this time, but I feel like absolute shit and it's not something I experienced the last time I was eating like this. I've been diligently tracking my macros, sodium, potassium, magnesium, I even started taking some potassium and magnesium supplements as well as a multi vitamin to help with total MG's daily. I have about zero energy most of the time, and today I woke up with what felt like vertigo. Whole room was spinning and I've felt horrible the entire day. My head has been hurting, I've felt light headed, etc. tonight I had a high calorie meal, and today I've gone over my macros (about 40-50g of carbs vs my usual 20-25g). I feel 100x better after the big meal tonight. I don't really know what's going on this go round but it almost certainly seems diet related.

I've been doing around 1800 calories daily with a target of under 25g carbs, but as mentioned, I feel atrocious, despite getting my required sodium, potassium, magnesium. 5000 sodium, 4000 potassium, 1500 magnisum. I can try increasing these more, but I never had any issues with these numbers previously. Wondering if anyone has any ideas or suggestions or thoughts on this. I love keto, I like the food, and it's hard to argue with the results I had, but I need to do something to change how I'm currently feeling.

1mb4lir,keto,Electrolyte supplements make me feel worse,"Was Carnivore with honey for 7 months prior and it's been 4 months strict carnivore, I started getting electrolyte deficiency symptoms when I started introducing caffeine back in, I was having about 400mg (caffeine makes me feel euphoric, I used it recreationally and that sounds weird to people lol) daily. I stopped since then and have been supplementing with electrolyte supplements since then.

3/4tsp potassium chloride daily, 2tsp salt, 500mg magnesium glycinate (and I take it all with my meal) + 2lbs ground beef a day + 10tbsp tallow.

Sometimes it gets better and I wake up feeling amazing, most of the time I wake up feeling worse. I struggle with dry eyes, lips, not the most restful sleep, fatigue, mild muscle spasms. Since then, I have significantly reduced salt or supplementation since Thursday cause I was sick. I was feeling decent and then one night I had an extra bit of potassium and salt together before bed and woke up feeling like crap with dry eyes again.

About a week prior, I was dealing with intense brain fog and not feeling well after my meals a few hours afterwards and feeling intensely on edge and I was having a tsp of salt per meal each, since stopped that and my symptoms after meals have gone away.

Anybody else experience this? I think my body is holding onto salt and potassium potentially due to higher aldosterone? I'm not sure but I'm going to have a period where I cut supplements and salt (other than a light graze over meals) completely to see how I feel. If that doesn't work then I'm adding back honey.

TL:DR no matter having a perfect supplement regiment I feel really bad after supplementation of electrolytes and I think my body may be holding minerals.",2025-07-28 02:31:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mb4lir/electrolyte_supplements_make_me_feel_worse/

My mother who’s been on and off and successful with keto suggested I try it since it’s used to treat seizure patients. It’s only been a few days and I also plan to do a one week fast at the end of the month because of the benefits but wow, I actually really fuck with it. I’ve been trying to lose weight for a while now and for made veryyyy slow (like years slow) progress (think 15 pounds down in like a year) so I decided to use this as an excuse to lose the rest of the weight (aka 30 pounds) that I want to lose to be at mg goal of 145 pounds / 66kg (I’m 173cm / 5’8 tall) and wow. I’ve never been so satieted in my life. CICO is actually…easier? When I’d eat full carbs on CICO I’d be SO hungry by the third day, and id be going to bed thinking about food. Now when I’m on keto sometimes I have to force myself to make lunch unless I do a hard workout in the morning. It hasn’t helped with the neurological stuff yet (I’ll give it another couple weeks before I make a final call on that) but … man. Every time I think about eating carbs again I think about all the times I tried fitting them into my diet and I just…wouldn’t have room for anything else. And I’d never feel satisfied. 

It sucks because whenever I look up Keto stuff on tiktok because to me, I like seeing other people do the stuff I want to do for encouragement, everyone is so mean and backhanded about it. I’m almost (but not really) thankful that I have to do this diet now because it feels so..natural.

Then again, I’ve always been someone who prefers fat and savory foods, but since I want to build muscle I’ve gotten convinced that I won’t build muscle without carbs and I need to eat low fat things to lose weight. I’m still researching on that last part tho. So anyone who’s knowledgeable on muscle and how keto can effect its growth esp in female/afab individuals sees this post, hmu.

Sometimes I can feel the tingling/itch begin on my neck if its been a while (+6 hours) since I took TUDCA. When I take it, the signs of a beginning rash quickly disappear.

I’m hoping for some advice and support. I weigh 235 lbs and am 5feet 6inches. I started my diet after fasting about a week ago. My supplements I take are BCAA, Electrolyte pills, MCT oil, a women’s multivitamin, sometimes Lipsomal Vitamen C, and my protein powders that I put in black coffee and water.

Right now I’m having a hard time eating enough calories and fat each day. I do hit my protein goal and keep my carbs at 20g or under daily (I count total carbs, not net carbs), but my fat and overall calories are usually low. I exercise at least 30 minutes to an hour every day on a split treadmill that keeps pressure off of my joints because I have holes all over my body left from the tumors that have been eradicated successfully with chemo and some radiation. 

I just finished a 48-hour water fast recently, supplemented with electrolytes, cream of tartar for potassium, and magnesium pills. Surprisingly, the fast was easy for me, and I’ve already gone through the re-feeding process.

I want to make sure I’m doing this safely and effectively, especially given my health conditions. Does anyone have tips for eating enough fat and calories on keto when you just aren’t that hungry?

1lg6v6v,keto,I Found A Great Solution For Protein Intake,"I was looking for a while for protein-rich stuff that’s not really fatty or sugary and is very inexpensive, of course. Many people recommend protein powder or eggs, but I found something even better: egg white powder. I did some calculations, and it’s incredible. Where I live, a 2.1-pound bag of it costs 32 bucks. It contains the egg whites of about 250 eggs, which would cost me at least 50 bucks, and it has a higher amount of protein overall than regular egg whites.

The downside is that there’s mostly nothing left in terms of nutrients besides protein, but since I take supplements here and there and eat veggies, I don’t mind that. Also, since it’s not a protein powder you have to drink — because you can cook these egg whites — it doesn’t disrupt your body that much. This might be the ultimate budget option.

The nutrients are about 84 percent protein and 4 percent naturally occurring carbs.

Another great tip I recently saw: you can mix some gelatin into your egg whites plus butter or ghee and make flat crepes, roll them up, and slice them into thin noodles. You could do the same with xanthan gum, but gelatin is just more readily available. Side note: if you want them to be even closer to real noodles, add vital wheat gluten and psyllium husk and salt 

if you would only take this as protein source and eat about 100g of this per day it only costs you 3 bucks and egg whites can mix with everything veggie or meaty you like

oh and another side note it doesent contain cholesterol wich is a thing many people struggle whit on keto

if anyone is planing on using these as main protein source i would recomend at very least this

Edit Below:

Spread 100g of egg white powder over 4 meals a day, with 25g of powder and about 150 ml of water per meal. Add around 1 teaspoon of psyllium husk and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to each. Take a break of about 3–4 hours between meals. This setup virtually guarantees that even the mildest protein-related insulin spike won’t occur.

Ideally, you would add more vegetables on top, but if you're on an extreme budget, you may need to rely on a vitamin supplement instead—using just the psyllium husk and possibly a lower-quality oil.",2025-06-20 15:28:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1lg6v6v/i_found_a_great_solution_for_protein_intake/

1jfi61s,vegetarian,10 whole years,"Just like that, it's 10 years later. A decade without (deliberately) consuming flesh. Honestly, it's something I forget about myself. It really is so easy now. Granted, I'm a ""bad"" vegetarian. I eat fake meat almost daily (if bocca burgers count). I figured Amy's and Morning Star would hold me over until I was farming quinoa in the compost I kept in the pocket of my hemp cargo shorts, but that transformation never came. 

I remained a pretty standard dude. I watch baseball, drink beer, and refuse to consume the material matter of sentient beings for sustenance as a humanistic stand for created values in an absurd and indifferent existence. Basically, because I know it doesn't matter what I do, that's why I choose not to.

No leather either. Shoes are still hard. Boots are impossible. That's the last leather I use are my 15ish year old heavy boots for winter. I oil the crap out of them cause once they're gone, that's it.


**Favorite foods:**

* local Chinese joint does a seitan chicken substitute that is top notch. 
* sushi is still pretty great without fish!
* frigging Pancheros
* falafel 

**Foods I Miss:**
* black pudding as part of a big frie-up breakfast...
* gelatin products: Heribo bears, marshmallows...jello



**Random pros:**
* instant connection to other veggie/vegans
* always easy to order when out, (we only ever have 1 or 2 options)


**Random cons**
* those rare times the restaurant (or host) doesn't have an option and you feel like a jerk.
* certain clothing items are difficult to impossible. So many brands make a canvas shoe then randomly stick a leather part on it. 
* supplements and medicines are difficult to find without gelatin or fish oil. I will bend here if it's unreasonable to avoid animal products. 
* it makes guitar repair more difficult. Protein glue for woodworking, bone for nuts and saddles etc. Niche, I know. 

Will I go vegan? Probably not. I've tried a few times and the difficulty goes way up. Both in terms of getting good nutrition (eggs, incredible, edible), and in terms of avoiding sneaky animal ingredients. 

Maybe I should. I don't know.


But yeah, that's it. Felt like telling somebody.

100xosb,vegetarian,To Our New Vegetarians: Here's What to Expect,"Since it's the New Year and this sub tends to get a lot of ""Going Vegetarian as My New Year's Resolution"" posts, I thought I'd let all the new veggies what they can expect from my observations from being a vegetarian for about thirty-five years and watching a lot of people start up with it.

(This is meant in good humor.  To everyone trying this for the first time or trying it again after falling off the wagon in the past, I do say welcome, and good luck with it!)

* **One Week In:** ""This is so easy!  Look at these delicious dinners I've been having!  I don't miss meat at all!  I should have done this years ago!""

The novelty is fun and you're trying new foods and recipes.  Enjoy!


* **One Month In:** ""I feel so much healthier!  I've lost weight!  I should have done this years ago!""

Yep, this is because you're watching everything you're eating and tend to be eating healthier foods.  As with any diet that you stick to, you'll lose weight. Also, when people start eating better, they tend to exercise more.  You might be taking walks, taking the stairs, etc.  But just wait until your digestive system starts objecting to the changes.  That will not have you feeling so great.

* **Six Months In:**  ""What are good restaurants?  I struggle when eating out.  I really miss this one dish, does anyone have any good substitutes?  What should I pack for lunch?  I'm tired of the same sandwich over and over.  Any good recipes for comfort foods?  What are some quick dinner ideas? I have a cookout coming up.  How can I navigate that?""

Okay, the novelty has worn off and you want foods you're familiar with.  You're tired of being ""the vegetarian"" in the group and just want something besides rolls and salad when you're with friends, dammit!  The exciting recipes you discovered six months ago just aren't cutting it now when you're tired after work and just want something quick.  You're starting to miss the foods you love.  This is where we start to lose people.

Warning: This is also around the time that you might get a little self-righteous.  You let everyone know that you're a vegetarian and may feel like you can't be around meat or people eating meat.  Some start pushing their diets on everyone and claim to get physically ill at just the thought of meat (which you were eating until recently).  Be careful.  If you do fall off the wagon, people will never let you live it down.  And you don't want to give all vegetarians a bad name.

* **One Year In:** ""OMG, I just found out that my favorite soup is made with chicken stock!  OMG, gelatin is an animal byproduct?  OMG, there's gelatin in everything!!  Wait, there's beef stock in the ingredients of these veggie noodles I've been eating??  What do you guys mean Caesar salad isn't vegetarian?  It's salad!!  And it's been my fallback at every restaurant!!  Wait, what's that about parmesan?  What's rennet?""

You started out just not eating obvious meats, but now you start learning about all the invisible ""meats"" you've been missing.  And it's all in foods that you've been relying on.  WTH?!?!  Now you have to start deciding how strict you want to be.  And this is probably about the time you were thinking about migrating toward being a vegan.  But how can you do that when you still need to eliminate foods you didn't even know weren't vegetarian?

* **After a Year:**  ""Anyone have some healthy recipes?  What kind of supplements should I be taking?  Anyone else have issues with anemia and B-12 deficiency?""

Congratulations, you've made it pretty far and may stick with this.  But, you're beginning to find that you don't feel as healthy because you've gotten a bit lazy.  You've started to rely to heavily on pastas and breads when you don't feel like making a big effort cooking.  Hey!  Oreos and Doritos are even vegan!!  You start filling up with junk food more and more.  You gain weight.  It may take a bit before you learn to balance things, but it's always easy to slide back to being a very unhealthy and overweight vegetarian.  (For all the teens living with non-vegetarian families, you're in the worst danger of this trap.  I've been there.)

* **After a Few Years:**  You rarely bring it up anymore.

Being a vegetarian is just part of who you are, like being left-handed, or liking to read, or watching sci-fi movies.  You rarely bring it up and *most* people just accept it about you and don't make a big deal about it (yes, there will always be *that* relative, but most people have just let it go by now).  You know how to navigate a menu, do a quick read of ingredients, and you've developed a whole new lineup of foods you regularly eat.  Stick with it and you will get there.

I wasnt really sure where else to ask this but im hoping someone here will be able to help me. so i was taking the GNC earth mens multivitamin for a few months and realized it actually had 0 iron. I thought it had a decent amount of it before realizing i misread iodine as iron. I see that the womens multivitamin DOES have iron, in fact it has 100% RDV. I have anemia in my family and am somewhat low in iron myself, I know that its more than possible to get iron from non meat sources but generally it seems that vegetarians and vegans can struggle getting iron from natural sources. So I was thinking about getting the womens version but Ive read a bit about iron toxicity being a potential risk (in general, for presumably meat eaters taking iron), do you think that would be unsafe? I am actually a trans woman if it makes a difference but obviously I dont have a period so Im not losing iron super quickly.  I definitely need some way to make up for missed iron in my diet. I love nuts and beans and have some at least every day but I dont eat them in excess or anything so idk. Any advice here would be great, or if you have any recommendations for vegetarian/vegan multi vitamin containing iron! Thanks.

tl;dr: is it still dangerous to be taking a multi vitamin with 100% iron RDV as a male born vegetarian that doesnt get enough iron normally.

pjzh2x,vegetarian,"Plant-based dietary patterns are associated with lower body weight, BMI and waist circumference in older Australian women"," 

## Abstract

**Objective:** To investigate the association between plant-based diets (PBD), and overweight/obesity compared to regular meat eaters in older women.

**Design:** Cross-sectional analysis.

**Setting:** 1946-51 birth cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). PBD were categorised as vegan, lacto-ovo vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian and regular meat eaters. Outcomes included body weight (BW), BMI and waist circumference (WC).

**Participants:** Women who completed Survey 7 (n 9102) with complete FFQ data.

**Results:** Compared to regular meat eaters, BW, BMI and WC were significantly lower in pesco-vegetarians (-10.2kg, 95%CI -5.1, -15.2; -3.8kg/m2, 95%CI -2.0, -5.6; -8.4cm, 95%CI -3.9, -12.9) and BW and BMI lower in lacto-ovo vegetarians (-7.4kg, 95%CI -1.2, -13.6; -2.9kg/m2, 95%CI -0.6, -5.1). In regular meat eaters, individuals consuming meat daily or multiple times/day had significantly higher BW, BMI and WC compared to those consuming meat >2 times/week but <daily or multiple times/day (2.5kg, 95%CI 1.5, 3.5; 0.9kg/m2, 95%CI 0.5, 1.3 and 2.2 cm, 95%CI 1.3, 3.1) and those consuming meat >1 but ≤2 times/week (6.8kg, 95%CI 1.8, 11.8); 2.1kg/m2, 0.3, 4.0 and 6.0cm, 95%CI 1.7, 10.4). **This association was dose-dependent** such that for every increase in category of weekly meat intake (i.e., >1 time per week but ≤2 times per week; >2 times per week but less than daily, and daily or multiple times per day), an associated 2.6kg (95%CI 1.8, 3.4) increase in BW, 0.9kg/m2 (95%CI 0.6, 1.2) increase in BMI and 2.3cm (95%CI 1.6, 3.0) increase in WC was reported.

**Conclusions:** BW, BMI and WC are lower in women following PBD and positively associated with increasing meat consumption. Results were robust to adjustment for confounders including physical activity levels, smoking status, habitual alcohol intake, use of supplements, and hormone replacement therapy.

I'm a life-long meat eater and picky eater, but I've been feeling worse and worse about eating meat for some time now. I love animals and it's really hard to feel good about what I eat considering the horrific stuff that happens to the animals involved.

But meat has always been a major food group for me, and something I eat pretty regularly and while I CAN eat other things, I've never found veggies and beans to be very tasty, so the supplements people usually suggest don't sound sustainable. I'm finding the motivation to just quit meat entirely to be tough, considering I don't think I'll be eating well, and I'm worried I'd just relapse after a few weeks of eating pasta and rice every day, which is not what i want.

ojiry0,vegetarian,Are supplements necessary when being a vegetarian/vegan?,"Ive been a vegetarian for 2 years next February 11th, I have never steadily taken and vitamins or supplements until about a week ago when I started taking a b12 and an iron vitamin daily. Before I started taking them I noticed for about a whole week that I was overwhelmingly tired and unmotivated feeling, now I have struggled on and off with depression for quite awhile so feeling this way wasn’t exactly new to me but it seemed strange and worse than usual so I thought maybe I AM really lacking, I know that b12 is really only found in animal products so it’s hard to get the right amount while on a vegetarian/vegan diet. (I do have some dairy but I rely mostly on almond milk and try to stay away from eggs and dairy products) I decided hey there’s no harm in at least TRYING a b12 and iron supplement since from what I know (correct me if I’m wrong) that iron deficiency can lead you to being tired, worn out, weak, and just overall not very energetic and sometimes make you dizzy depending on how bad the deficiency is, and for b12 it is very important for your nervous system health and also heart health, SO in conclusion these are both vitamins that are important for energy and having a healthy brain/mental state. (again correct me) So last week I decided to try taking a daily iron and b12 supplement and let me tell you, be it placebo or basic ole science and nutrition I have felt a lot better, I haven’t had the overwhelming tiredness and unmotivated feeling like I was before and I just feel like hey if these 2 vitamins really helped me get my energy back this much I think other people on plant based diets should really consider trying them just for a week and see if you can notice any difference.

I’ve been vegetarian for 4 years now and even though I was always low on iron (when I was eating meat and when I stopped) because of the poor diet this past year,  I run out also of ferritin (also at minimum now).

What kind of simple recipes could I try for her? I do love vegetarian dishes but she's iffy about some veg and texture so it'll be an interesting adventure.

n90k4c,vegetarian,A word about protein,"For a little while now, on this sub, I've been seeing a few bits of misinformation regarding protein floating around, as well as myself and others getting downvoted each time we correct them. I do not claim to be an expert, but I've been vegetarian for almost a decade and have tried different forms of it over the years.  
  
I know we all hate hearing comments from relatives or people around us like ""Where do you get your proteins then???"", but there are interesting considerations to be made when we become vegetarian.  
    
Here are a few facts and things to keep in mind:  
  
* An average sedentary male needs 56g/day, and 46 for a female. The more active you are, the more you will need.
* Protein is an absolutely essential part of your meals, as it helps repair your tissues, bones, muscles, etc. [They have tons of essential functions.](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/functions-of-protein)
* I've read a comment recently stating that you could get enough of them from vegetables. Unless you eat a truckload per day, that is simply not possible. At 2-3g/100g for most veggies, think of how much you'd need to eat to reach your recommended amount. 
* Also recently, someone has said that people ate too much protein and that it made them fat and unhealthy. The saturated fat and calories from meat (or cheese, or lots of other less healthy sources) will make someone fat and unhealthy, not protein. [The protein amount that will cause issues will start around 2g/kg.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/when-it-comes-to-protein-how-much-is-too-much) That is very high and takes a lot of dedication to attain as a vegetarian. So this is a non-issue for (most of) us.  
* You can absolutely build muscle and be as fit as you want without eating meat, but it requires conscious choices (I'm up 12kg myself). So tell your uncle/dad/dumb gymrat buddy that he's wrong.

Speaking more candidly from personal experience, I can say that being more careful about my intake has made a huge difference. For the first 7-8ish years, I would eat generally healthy and balanced, but without caring much for protein, B12, or anything like that. I was skinny as I'd always been, generally healthy, but I started realizing that I was often tired and simply could not put on kilos to reach a more healthy weight. A few years ago, I started taking B12 supplements and eating A LOT more protein, much less processed food, as well as exercising regularly (which played a huge role, of course) and my energy levels have been through the roof.  
  
There are so many amazing vegetarian protein sources: dairy products, eggs, soy products, seitan, tempeh, legumes, grains, etc. I'm not your annoying uncle that pokes fun at you for not getting any protein without meat or anything like that. I just feel like it's very important to promote a healthy diversity on your plate, so that's why I've made this post. Enjoy eating whatever you want and be as healthy as you want, just be careful with what you read in some comments.  
  
Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",2021-05-10 09:43:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/n90k4c/a_word_about_protein/

The more research I do the more this seems like a bad idea though. 
Deficiencies to look out for include calcium, iron, iodine, zinc, omega 3/6, and b12. I feel like I have to micromanage these and or add in supplements to make sure I don’t go anemic.

I lift weights heavy 4-5 days a week so protein sources I’ve used now are seitan, plant protein drinks, and no cow protein bars.

I make salads that include spinach, cucumber, tomato, carrots, peppers, and hemp seeds.

I plan on making vegetable soups with lentils, beans, potatoes, onions, kale eventually.

1kqr2wr,bodyweightfitness,24M My Story of Overcoming Golfer's Elbow and Ulnar Neuropathy,"Hello everyone, I want to write about and share my experience of dealing with golfer's elbow and ulnar neuropathy, cubital tunnel syndrome. First and foremost, this is just my experience, this is not to be used to diagnose yourself - **speak with a professional**.

**About me**: I am a 24 year old male, Marine veteran, current college student, gym and lifted 5-6x a week along with cardio. I enjoy the active and health-focused lifestyle.

**Where it begins**: About a year ago now, \~ July of 2024, after my gym sessions I could feel a tightness in my left forearm - elbow area. While this became progressively prevalent, there was not pain with it yet and I had figured it was just a pump or soreness from my lifts. Then suddenly one day, I couldn't barely even pick up a 20lb dumbbell. Trying to make myself bench felt like my elbow was pulling my forearm really hard and left me in pain the rest of the day. I figured maybe I've just not given my body enough rest lately, so I gave myself a week of no workouts to see how it felt. It felt fine - until I lifted anything, then the pulsing pain returned. At this point, I was losing strength in my arm and could barely even lift my water pitcher. After Googling over and over again, I saw that my symptoms matched tennis elbow and decided to schedule an appointment with my primary. My appointment was a few weeks out, so during this time I kept Youtubing and Googling everything about it that I could. I bought a [Theraband Flexbar](https://www.amazon.com/TheraBand-Tendonitis-Resistance-Tendinitis-Intermediate/dp/B00066D6K4/ref=asc_df_B00066D6K4?mcid=2fca92d2204837e7a21ec63a8cc8fd1a&hvocijid=12332776855787297269-B00066D6K4-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12332776855787297269&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9198274&hvtargid=pla-2281435180298&psc=1) and some exercises helped, some didn't, the [Tyler Twists](https://youtu.be/7SQNnM6k9Vk), [Reverse Tyler Twists](https://youtu.be/LtR8fYEUnXI) looked popular and promising, but these two didn't help me. Some of the exercises in this [video helped](https://youtu.be/Jkl5X4qOP70), I would do these about 5 times a week. I tried about every supplement you can name - I was using MSM, glucosamine, chondroitin, bromelain, quercetin, omega-3s, collagen, and probably some more I can't remember. I kept taking those just in case for a while. Now at this point, I'm at my appointment with my primary to explain my issue - here I am diagnosed with golfer's elbow and referred to physical medicine to discuss an occupational therapy plan. I was also prescribed a topical NSAID (you can get it at most stores, [Kroger has some](https://www.kroger.com/p/kroger-diclofenac-sodium-1-topical-arthritis-pain-reliever-gel/0004126001100)). This helped some, but not for long periods of time.

**Golfer's elbow Improvement**: Waiting weeks for my referral appointment, then another month to start my occupational therapy, I felt like I was losing hope in getting better. I still could not workout, let alone even lift basic things in my house with my left arm, turning my steering wheel was difficult, I couldn't type for long periods of time, etc... Finally, I begin occupational therapy. Just after the first week, some of the pain was relieved and I began to restore strength. Very quickly, a night and day difference. What I believe to have helped the most was the scraping ([Video on it here](https://youtu.be/1OKMFIEWkd4)), then light stretching and eccentric strengthening ([these two here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507006/#:~:text=Hold%20a%20weight%20in%20your,with%20the%20weight%20in%20it)) and slowly rebuilding strength using resistance bands ([the resistance band exercises on this page](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/aftercareinformation/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=av2582)). I was quite surprised how quickly I recovered from these sessions. After about 2 months of doing this twice a week, my golfer's elbow was pretty much better... However, a different pain persisted.

**Other notes on golfers elbow**: Throughout the time it took me to heal, I tried many different supplements and bought many things like compression sleeves and grip strengthening equipment. I tried a few cheap compression sleeves, but those only hurt me so I decided to try a more expensive one ([here](https://compressionhealth.com/medi-epicomed-elbow-support/?sku=K400213&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22403814666&gbraid=0AAAAAC7-yveQgZS1OlRd94fB4QtKqT2S9&gclid=CjwKCAjwravBBhBjEiwAIr30VFlFrKR96w3xNh-Hj_tsCDsh3XMlOB6SgKgxeopRiq0ipebcv_-UZRoCmhoQAvD_BwE)) and it helped to occasionally alleviate some of the pain. Though, I wouldn't say it's necessary. I went most of the time without using compression. Over time, the only supplements I kept for this were the omega-3 fish oils, which i use [these](https://www.iherb.com/pr/life-extension-super-omega-3-plus-120-softgels/67022?gad_campaignid=400306152&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwravBBhBjEiwAIr30VL_SN467ZgA8WFNGXxPK5cwBsoDS7Muq5ZcidCnSBu9TY6Qr7AIuWxoCBOwQAvD_BwE). Later, I will have more, but those will be for my experience with Cubital Tunnel Syndrome.

So, it comes down to listening to your body when you begin to feel any sort of pain that is even slightly different than ordinary. You want to avoid irritating the inflammation/damage around the elbow, this will only set you back and will prevent any progress in healing. DO NOT completely stop all exercise. Tendons like blood flow to heal, but you cannot overdo it. Light work with the resistance bands a couple times a week to not overdo it.

**Ulnar Neuropathy / Cubital Tunnel Syndrome**: At this point, my forearm and elbow felt much better, and I was regaining strength on my own. However, There was a sort of ""line"" of sensitivity and pain that would originate from my back side of my elbow through my triceps, and I was beginning to experience tingling and numbness in my pinky and ring finger. This is all still on my left arm. It seemed as if the pain just moved to a different spot. This quickly led to a lot of pain in my lower neck/upper back. This pain continued to get worse and sometimes I was left in bedridden with how bad of headaches I was getting. It was like my neck was being pulled down into my trap/upper back area. Sometimes, I couldn't even type papers for my classes because my arm would become too sensitive and painfully tingly. So, I go back to my primary and discuss everything up to this point and I get scheduled an EMG. I slowed down how much I was exercising again (I was still just using resistance bands and the flexbar), while I waited for my EMG and follow up. After the EMG and at my follow up appointment, I was diagnosed with Cubital Tunnel Syndrome. My EMG showed a delay in my ulnar nerve through my elbow confirming a compressed nerve. While there has been no full explanation how this could have occurred, my best guess is the large amount of inflammation from golfer's elbow could have caused my nerve to be compressed.

I have made many lifestyle changes in my attempt to overcome this. #1: Sleep and sleeping position, I am a side sleeper and like to keep my arm under me under my pillow. This is bad, change this if you do that. I got [this brace/sleeve](https://www.amazon.com/Syndrome-Immobilizer-Stabilizer-Arthritis-Tendonitis/dp/B085STBTZ1/ref=asc_df_B085STBTZ1?mcid=d1b6bc18729139b2ab417b775f0a1e10&hvocijid=18079882627429216829-B085STBTZ1-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18079882627429216829&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9198274&hvtargid=pla-2281435179258&th=1) to sleep in, which keeps my arm straighter throughout the night. I have changed my sleeping position to sleep on my back instead of my side, this keeps my neck and arms straight by my sides. It's a struggle to change how you sleep but has gotten easier over the past few months. I invested in a weighted blanket which has helped me fall asleep quicker, as well as reduce movement in my sleep. I also bought a cervical pillow to keep my neck in line with my back. Get a good amount of sleep, your body heals most during periods of rest. I could tell right away if I slept well enough or not because of the amount of pain my neck would be in. Adequate sleep has, by far, been the most important factor in my healing. #2: Posture, I am constantly reminding myself to be aware of my posture, especially when sitting and typing. #3: Diet, maintaining a healthy and balanced diet will provide your body with what it needs to help recover and I added supplements to aid nerve regeneration and inflammation: [Turmeric](https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/liposomal-turmeric-curcumin-capsules-90-capsules/vs-4132), [beetroot](https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/solaray-beet-root-605-mg-100-capsules/so-1028), [vitamin B1](https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/solaray-vitamin-b-1-100-mg-100-capsules/so-1387), and [B12 w/ folic acid](https://www.iherb.com/pr/solaray-vitamin-b-12-with-folic-acid-lozenges-natural-cherry-1-000-mg-90-lozenges/23821?gad_campaignid=400306152&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwravBBhBjEiwAIr30VCUlS3C2l8VpaQaWpKdqK9HoZTkdN2FvS2KmOQviMzyBbflpORuqYRoCuSQQAvD_BwE) on top of the omega-3s. I really believe the B vitamins especially have helped my progress in healing my nerve damage.

**Nerve and Neck improvement**: I was not given any physical or occupational therapy options. Just told to use the sleeping brace and to keep my arm straight to let it heal. If I did not get any better in the next \~ 4 months, it may be worth trying surgery the physical medicine dr told me. I was informed about a few different nerve glides (also called nerve flossing) ([here ](https://youtu.be/UY97v4WxrzI)and [here](https://youtu.be/Z9-X9yfv5R8)), though they haven't helped me, but some say doing them has helped in their case. However, my neck pain at this point was not getting any better and it was just being chucked up to possibly because of nerve irritation. I decided to try some things on my own, and this is where I started getting better. Most of my pain, other than the ulnar nerve through my elbow, was around the lower part of my neck and upper back / shoulder blade area. I figured, that maybe because I haven't been able to workout in so long I exaggerated some sort of muscle imbalance. So, I decided to start strengthening my back. Starting with 5 and 10 lbs dumbells, I've worked on back about 2-3 times a week, and very quickly my neck pain went away. It has been about a month and I have worked up to 20 lb dumbells now. I would do [supermans](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/superman-exercise), [scapula pushups](https://youtu.be/5YHZnEsE9hA), [dumbbell shrugs](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/dumbbell-shrugs.html), [light dumbbell deadlifts](https://youtu.be/JNpUNRPQkAk), [around the world](https://youtu.be/9uqGfOvtqn0), [one arm dumbbell row](https://youtu.be/PgpQ4-jHiq4). Also, stretching slowly after these light workouts and before bed, including some yoga poses: [the child's pose](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/multimedia/childs-pose/vid-20453580#:~:text=Kneel%20and%20sit%20on%20your%20knees%20with%20your%20knees%20slightly,for%20at%20least%20eight%20breaths), and [the cobra pose](https://www.onepeloton.com/blog/how-to-do-cobra-pose).

There are still some days where my back feels tight, but nowhere near the amount of pain I was consistently in for months. As my neck has gotten better, I have noticed some improvement with my ulnar nerve as well. However, I still feel that sleep has been the most important factor in healing that.

This has just been my experience. It takes time and it's easy to lose hope. But work with yourself and you will get through it. I hope I was able to help someone out.

Hey everyone,  
I've been greasing the groove (GTG) consistently for a little over 2 months now, and it's been a pretty rewarding experience. As someone who's still learning, adapting, and testing things out, I thought it might be valuable to start a little Q&A thread where we can all share how we personally approach GTG.

Even if you're no longer doing GTG—or only tried it briefly—I’d love to hear your take. Please answer any or all of the following:

**Suggested Questions:**

* How old are you?
* Approximately how long have you been greasing the groove?
* How exactly do you do it? (Structured plan? Feel-based? Reps-to-fatigue? etc.)
* How many days a week do you do GTG?
* What else do you do for fitness besides GTG?
* What have been some of your gains (starting reps → new max), and how long did that take?
* Have you noticed an average number of reps you gain each month or over time?
* If you train intuitively, about how many sets do you average per day?
* Are you taking any supplements?

**To go first:**

I’m 18 and I’ve been doing GTG for **2 months and 2 days**.

I use a **structured progression system**:

* I start each cycle at 50% of my max for 5 sets/day.
* I add **1 rep every 5 days**, and **1 set every 15 days**.

Example progression:

* Max: 18 pushups
* Days 1–5: 9 reps × 5 sets
* Days 6–10: 10 reps × 5 sets
* Days 11–15: 11 reps × 5 sets
* Days 16–20: 12 reps × 6 sets
* Days 21–25: 13 reps × 6 sets
* Days 26–30: 14 reps × 6 sets
* New max after cycle: **24**

I take a **3-day deload** at the end of each cycle (2 days rest, 1 day to test max).

I do GTG **7 days a week**. Outside of that:

* I walk **20k steps every day**
* I stretch **20 minutes daily**
* I jump rope **once a week**
* I **don’t take any supplements**

I’ve gained **10 pushups total**—6 in the first month, 4 in the second. Not trying to brag (genuinely!), just hoping to offer transparency so others can compare results, systems, and ideas.

Would love to hear how the rest of you do GTG, whether it’s casual, strict, experimental, or just something you’ve tried in passing. Hoping this can be a useful place to swap ideas and find what’s working best across different experiences.",2025-05-15 23:56:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1knn525/fellow_gtg_users_qa_sharing_knowledge_and/
1kmbrwp,bodyweightfitness,"Starting to build my homegym today, advice and tips appreciated!","Hi Guys! I really don't like going to regular gyms since all gyms in my area are always crowded and way too expensive imo. 

Therefore I'm starting to build my own little home gym today and I could use some tips and guidence. 
I'm starting off with buying an adjustable set of manuals upto 24kgs, a multigrip-pullupbar today, and possibly buying a used simple bench later on if I don't find a good deal at the store km going to. 

This is ofc a verry simple start and not that expensive (equates to maybe 200-250usd).

But in addition to what I mentioned, I'd like a bit more equipment to do some more focused triceps and back-workout.
Any suggestions? 

I work on an anchorhandeling tugger supply ship (ahts) and I do work out at work, so I mainly wanna focus on building and maintaining the muscle groups related with lifting heavy objects and using a sledgehammer alot.

I don't care for cardio since I'm already naturally skinny with only 17% bodyfat, and im above average musclemass for my body type and weight. 
I also walk quite alot since I live in a verry walkable city where driving in town sucks, so cardio equipment is not needed.

I could also use a bit of advice regarding supplements, however Ive already started taking creatine. 
I started loading it two weeks ago and today I started taking the regular recommended dose. 

I do take adhd medicine so I don't think I need or should use any preworkouts, since I'm already practically taking fake amphetamine. However, I don't know for sure whether i should avoid it or if I'm okay to use it. If anybody knows more abt mixing pre-workout and adhd-medication I'd like to hear your opinions! 

So yeah, if anyone has any suggestions for equipment I should get, supplements I should start taking or possibly dyi-hacks I could use to maximize my effectiveness I'd really appreciate it!

1kl8lui,bodyweightfitness,Why am I unable to do more than 20-25 push-ups after training myself for over a year?,"16M, 6’ or 6’ 1”, weigh roughly 140lbs (can be considered underweight by some, but if you look at my body, then you will probably doubt that as I have a muscular and lean (I look like a shredded calisthenics professional but without a ton if veins and have smaller muscles than they would just to get an idea) build that does not mirror a teenager that is a rack of bones or even underweight on that matter). 

For those of you who have thought that my diet is lacking as I am underweight, I eat healthy with vegetables, fruits, seeds, eggs, other meats like meat sticks (of various different meats), and whatever foods you would see a typical North American eat that is not fast food, junk food, or any dessert. I also take some minerals and vitamin supplements (zinc, iron, copper, vitamin D & C just to name a few) as my father kept suggesting that I take them (he also thinks I am underweight but he has barely even seen me under my shirt and I do not live with him, so he does not know my lifestyle well (I live with my mother)), plus I wanted to see if they would affect anything, and I believe they did end up helping a bit. The only thing I am unsure of right now is whether I am eating “enough”, I feel that I eat a lot of food, but some foods have more calories and different nutrients than others and I do not record those metrics.

\[ORIGINAL POST STARTS BELOW THIS, EDITED/ADDITIONS ARE ABOVE THIS TO NOT GET CONFUSED\]

I am a 16 year old male (height about 6 foot or 6’ 1”), I used to have a skinny-fat body and weighed around 195lbs at my peak, currently weight about 135-140lbs with a considerably defined body and have visible veins across my forearms, shoulders, arms, and even my legs a bit. Have been training since January of 2024. I also run too, it used to be nearly impossible for me to jog even a kilometre, and now I can jog (much faster than before, almost running speed) for almost 5 kilometres whilst only breathing through my nose, and yes it is extremely uncomfortable and exhausting to breathe out of my nose whilst jogging and running for an extended period of time but once I run for a couple minutes I enter some kind of “special state” in which I feel like I can run forever and my mind becomes incredibly tough and I am able to run much greater distances without going mentally insane from the discomfort. Yes, my legs are MUCH stronger than my arms, but I have not slacked off on training my arms, especially my forearms at all.

To be clear, my title is quite inaccurate, as though it is true I have been doing calisthenics for over a year, I have not been training solely my arms. Though being completely honest, unless my form is just incredibly bad (which it should not be), I am unable to do more than 20-25 push-ups (Close grip).  
\*\*This little paragraph probably does not make sense to many as to where it is placed, as this was the original first paragraph I wrote, but I decided to add more context to my post and wrote the paragraph right under the bracketed words/above this one before posting\*\*

When I began training, my record was only 8 push-ups, and my body was shaking like crazy near the end, which showed that my core was weak as heck. But after a few months of doing various calisthenic exercises, like push-ups, bodyweight squats, sit-ups, etc, my record was about 30, now after continuing to train myself for almost a year after that, my record has gone down to 20-25, even though my body is insanely stronger than before. I can do several pistol squats now, my forearms are muscular as fudge (compared to before), and pretty much all of my prior muscular feats from a year earlier have been beaten by a lot.

I personally believe that this has only happened because I keep changing the kind of push-ups I do, as I used to do regular push-ups with a wider grip, but I eventually began to experiment with progressions so I would not have to do as many repetitions as before. I tried close grip, spider man or super man (whatever they were called) push-ups, diamond push-ups, and a couple others, but it seems that whenever I tried doing a different push-up, even just a slightly different push-up from the regular ones, like close grip, the reps I could do decreased immensely for that specific push-up, which you could say is normal, but after trying those different push-ups for a while I decided to try doing regular push-ups again to see how much “stronger” I became, and guess what, my reps decreased instead of increasing for a regular push-up, and by quite a bit, it was like my strength nearly reset, my record went from like 30 down to 10 or 15 somehow. I am assuming that I guess different push-ups target ever so slightly different muscles, even down to the individual muscle fibres, which maybe is why my reps decreased even though I got “stronger” after trying different push-ups, but it still feels wrong and not normal to me at all.

Another interesting thing to me is that even though I am so much stronger than I used to be, the amount of weight I can lift (doing bicep curls) has not increased at all for almost two years (even when I was a fat and weak kid), which would support my prior statement that certain exercises target certain muscles, even down to the exact fibre, meaning that even though I have improved my calisthenic capabilities, my ability to lift weight (aside from my own body weight I guess…) has not improved, like at all…

Has anyone experienced a situation similar to mine, or is there an obvious explanation, or did I already have the answer to my problem?",2025-05-13 00:29:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1kl8lui/why_am_i_unable_to_do_more_than_2025_pushups/

I enjoy having a video to follow along to. 

Is there any thing out there that would be a good alternative or should I just stick with Beachbody?

1jvut24,bodyweightfitness,10 Years of Casual Bodyweight Fitness / Calisthenics,"I've been doing calisthenics for about 10 years now, but I don't see myself as some athlete or anything. Just your regular dude who went to college, got a job, and now has a small family. I guess I just kinda fell into being consistent with working out. Looking back at the last 10 years, the longest break (and definitely the toughest for me) was after I had some serious gallstone surgery back in 2021, which kept me out of training for around a month. Other than that, I pretty much always managed to squeeze in at least two workouts a week.

When it comes to food, I keep it pretty simple – just a typical Vietnamese diet with loads of rice, veggies, pork, chicken... nothing particularly special compared to the average person here. I enjoy a beer or two now and then (got drunk every birthday and new year party), never bother counting calories, and haven't ever used any kind of supplements.

With social media being totally flooded with these crazy body transformations that supposedly happen super fast, I'm hoping this post can help anyone just starting out to have a more realistic idea of what to expect.

[What I look like now](https://youtube.com/shorts/r2UCB3VSdOY?feature=share)

Just a heads-up, most of the big changes happened in those first 3 or 4 years. Since then, it's been a bit of a up-and-down journey, but I've generally kept that kinda muscular look (at least, that's what my friends tell me – LOL) since around 2018.

**My main takeaways:**

* **Making it a habit is key:** Seriously, I think building that habit is the absolute best way to stay fit for the long haul. I'm at the point where training feels like just another thing I do, like brushing my teeth. I actually feel like I'm missing out if I don't get a workout in for a while.
* **The best plan is the one you actually stick to:** I've messed around with all sorts of routines – full body, push/pull/legs, circuit training, greasing the groove, etc. While they all have their good and bad points, the one that works best is simply the one you can keep doing.
* **It's totally OK to just enjoy calisthenics casually, like me:** Don't go comparing yourself to those pro athletes you see online!",2025-04-10 10:40:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1jvut24/10_years_of_casual_bodyweight_fitness_calisthenics/

My current setup:

- At home pull-up bar
- Creatine monohydrate
- Whey protein powder
- *open to include kettle bell workouts*


Goals and Questions:

Should I start with something light for a week or two before jumping into a full routine? Should I warm up and or stretch before each session?

I’m mainly focused on pushups and pull-ups. Are there specific variants I should try as a beginner? I’ve heard about negative pull-ups and pushups, are those the best starting points? If so, when should I stop doing negatives and switch to full reps?

I’ve got creatine monohydrate and whey protein powder. How can I use them effectively? When’s the best time to take them?

I’m open to incorporating kettlebells. What are some good exercises to pair with calisthenics?

1j5niho,bodyweightfitness,Muscles twitch under heavy load?,"Hi guys and gals, I'm a long time lurker and I finally have something to ask y'all. 

I've done calisthenics for a while now, started in corona around 2021 due to a calisthenics park nearby with a recent 8 months break due to an injury in my shoulder. It healed fine, there's nothing left. 

Before my break I could hold a front lever in rings for ~10s without resistance bands and with 1 to 2 FL pull ups afterwards, without any real signs of muscle twitching and without taking any supplements besides creatine. 

After my pause I can't hold a FL any more (obviously), but my muscles also began twitching heavily. Not a ""without load"" twitch like eyes sometimes do (although I hadn't had that for years), but rather a ""this is too hard"" kind of tremble, even if it's just holding a front lever for a few seconds with heavy resistance bands around my feet. It also occurs if I'm in machines rowing like 50kg instead of my 70kg bodyweight (closest movement to FL pull ups) where I can usually row like 80-100kg.

It got a little better after eating more salts, but it just doesn't stop even though I am back in training for a few months now with slowly increased weights and an elonged warm up period before training.

What I tried so far to make it stop: 
•longer rest periods between sets and between training days
•eating and drinking more salt (bloodtests condirmed I'm low on salts, genetically induced)
•taking iron, magnesium, vitamins and stuff regularily now
•starting with way lower loads (machine assisted)

and nothing really worked.

Do you guys and girls have any other ideas? It's not really hindering me in my semi-daily routines, it's just annoying as frick and I fear another injury might occur if I don't find out what's up.",2025-03-07 13:20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1j5niho/muscles_twitch_under_heavy_load/

Here is my routine, it has been mostly to keep me in movement without a proper consistent objective, so don't see it as being exact and tailored, this is the last I did a month ago and still going. For example I change band strength or reps for pull-ups.

1. Plank: 60 seconds
2. Arch Hold: 50 seconds
3. Knee Raises (ABS): 8 reps

1gk23c4,bodyweightfitness,Is it the protein or the rings?  Or both?,"First of all, not sure where to ask this question...so really sorry if this is not the right place.

I started protein supplements about 2 months now, for the first time in my life.  So I know I am getting at least 50g of protein daily from protein powder, and trying to get another 50g from just normal foods.  For context, I'm 5'7"" about 140 lbs.  
  
Incidentally, I also started training with rings about a month ago.

My observation is that with rings I train a lot harder (judging by how much harder I'm breathing) and seem to go to failure more.  The surprising thing is, my DOMS seem quite a lot milder...and usually builds up very slowly.  E.g. I workout on Monday, mainly upper body.  Tuesday I'm fine, just go walk or go biking (no upper body).  Wednesday, my rest day, I start to feel just slight muscle tightness/soreness in my upper body.  Thursday, no more soreness.  This is not what I experience when I train to failure with free weights (which is what I used to do mostly).  When training with free weights, IF I go full out and train to failure, I'm usually pretty sore the next day, and may even linger to the day after.

So...wondering what's the deal?  Is it:

1) Because of the protein?  This is what I have been lacking all my life (a trainer friend has ALWAYS said to me I don't eat nearly enough for the amount of workout/activity I do)?  Is it the protein that is that much more helpful in muscle recovery which is why I'm feeling less sore?

2) Because of rings?  Unlike free weights which seems to be much more targeted at very specific muscles, rings require coordination of a lot of the body working together to provide the stability.  Therefore rings are less intense on any 1 particular muscle but spreads the load across a larger muscle group?  Is that the case?",2024-11-05 08:26:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gk23c4/is_it_the_protein_or_the_rings_or_both/

I've always had an extremely clean diet and been active and athletic. I started lifting in '23 (because I plateaued with body weight exercise) and stopped in '24 owing to issues with my schedule (reverted to calisthenics then). My metabolism is extremely high- I could always go for a large meal. I've been working non stop over the last year and couldn't work out as much as I'd like. Woke up at 04:30 everyday to get mini workouts in before work and even put in a few reps every now and then at the office but yeah... These last couple of months, I've NEEDED my sleep and just couldn't. I'm a basketball junkie and need to hoop at least once a week, and the combo of less calories than I needed and sport based cardio being the only real exercise (even that not as often as I'd like), I'm losing muscle quickly. My arms and thighs are burning up, and now even my abs - which remained untouched through it all are looking frail. I have never taken supplements (creatinine, whey protein or anything because I avoid processed food as often as I can) but am considering doing so now.

1fcnqls,bodyweightfitness,What kind of exercise would be the best option during plantar warts treatments? ,"I used to enjoy spending 2 to 3 hours in the gym power walking on the treadmill, doing other cardio exercises and strength training about 4 days a week.

However, as I got busy and exhausted commuting to work for 3 hours by the subway and having to stay in the workplace for 10 hours, somehow I couldn't make it to the gym even though I was available to work out on the weekends, the gym's right near the place I live and open 24/7 if you have a membership.

But still, I tried to practice some free-weight exercises and yoga during my 2 hours break at work.

In January, my back and joints started to hurt and I was diagnosed with annular tears in my lumbar intervertebral discs and my knee pain is still there with no remarkable sign found on MRI. I realised doctors aren't able to fix these issues because medical test results are all they say and all they base their treatments upon.  I quit my job, I was depressed and in pain to the extent that I didn't eat anything just because I couldn't sit down even for a while(because of pain in the lower back and buttocks)and to lay down in bed and not upset my stomach at the same time, I gave up on eating.

I started exercising again, mostly walking for my recovery, desperately hoping it would work.  It was worth it.  It dramatically improved situations by allowing the disc to recover its shock absorption capacity. After adapting to light cardio exercises, I went to the gym and did various beginner-level strength training exercises for my glutes, core, and knee.

Unfortunately, I discovered that the big callus on my right foot was not a callus but a plantar wart, and it spread very quickly to the left foot and toes. I'm currently on cryotherapy for it once in two weeks. Doctors tell me to avoid as much as I can giving pressure on my feet. But, why? Is it true that the pressure makes warts go deeper into the skin? I exercise almost every day.  About an hour and a half of cardio (prolonged power walking on the treadmill, 20 minutes elliptical, and some weight lifting in between). Sadly despite several sessions of cryotherapy and consuming zinc and curcumin supplements, the amount of warts on my feet and their sizes are becoming worse. I cannot stand or walk without attaching bandages on them and wearing thick socks. What's worse is cryotherapy hurts. I sometimes doubt if my doctor is doing it in the best way possible because he doesn't shave a solid, thick surface on the top enough before freezing it. If I ask him to cut the top skin more, he just replies to me saying that he had better not. I guess making it bleed doesn't do any good. I don't know.

What are exercises that would help my lower back, yet not stress out the feet but at the same time have some cardiovascular benefits as well? I can't go to swimming pools or saunas right now. I was considering yoga, but I'm concerned about what its excessive flexion or mobility activities will do to my lower back and knee pain.

What exercises, sports, and activities do you suggest I engage in for these situations and is there any advice about gym training or plantar warts treatments?",2024-09-09 12:03:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1fcnqls/what_kind_of_exercise_would_be_the_best_option/

1en9p02,bodyweightfitness,"Almost 40, Switching from weights to calisthenics, questions before my journey begins!","A little background...I am an active 39 year old guy. I am 5'11"" 205 lbs, with a lot of muscle. I used to be 245 lbs out of college, went on a big big fitness journey, become a personal trainer, got down to 180lbs. I am getting a bit out of shape as I've aged, but still have great arms, legs, chest, back, and some visible abs. Most of my fat is stored in my midsection.

My primary types of fitness are weightlifting (free weights), boxing, and yoga. Though I have experience in lots of different stuff.

I was recently diagnosed with degenerative disc issues on my L5 (lower back). It was aggravated pretty badly while playing 2 hours of basketball a month or so ago. I am doing PT/Chiropractic work now to fix it. Its getting better, but I do wake up with back issues now and then (though our new mattress is excellent, shout out tempur-pedic).

My fitness plan, in a perfect world will be...2x a week calisthenics, 1-2x a week boxing at home (heavy bag using Fight Camp), 1x 60 min yoga, 1x 40-60 min recovery workout (foam roll + functional stretching).

My goal is to lose weight and get good at cali skills (front lever, planche). I don't need to build any muscle, but ideally maintain my current muscle mass (rough guess I am at 15%-ish bodyfat) while losing fat.

So my questions for those calisthenics folks out there...

1. Any precautions moving into calisthenics? I would think being near 40, my warmups have to be very diligent and I have to be very careful as I advanced in skills. Especially given my lower back.
2. Is calisthenics horrible for the lower back? Or heck is it good for it? My idea is I am removing heavy weightlifting from my routine because that can really strain my back and using primarily bodyweight and isometric strength (augmented by yoga) focusing on core work could be really good for it.
3. Whats your diet like? I am flexitarian and rarely eat meat. Maybe 1x a week. So getting my protein goal is hard. I aim for roughly 120g of protein a day. Obviously the rest is vegetables, fruits, whole grains etc...
4. Any supplements you find really helpful?
5. Lastly and maybe most importantly...**what equipment should I buy?** I have done a lot of research so far and it seems to me I need a pull up bar in the least. I am planning on going to pick up the Base Blocks Big Bar on facebook marketplace for 120$ which seems like a steal. I am thinking that plus some Gymnast Rings and some paralettes should have me set. That way I can do:
   1. Pullups, horizontal rows (with rings), dips (with rings), pushups (either on rings or parallettes), handstands
6. A lot of the skills seemed focused on upper body, and thats cool...but what do we focus on for lower? I would assume squats and some kinda hinge movement. Maybe a nordic trainer for hamstrings down the road?

You guys told me, in addition to my exercise routine, to focus on protein. That's what I've been doing. It took me a while to figure out how to maintain my weight while taking in a lot of protein. But yogurt, cottage cheese and some supplements and protein bars did the trick.

I'm 172 lb, 6' 3"", and as a result of the advice I received here, taking in about 130 g of protein a day. I know it's not a gram per pound. The perfect is the enemy of the good.

Up to nine pull-ups now, triple what I did two months ago. Twelve is just a matter of time. After that, pull-ups and wide grip pull-ups. Then, who knows? Maybe even a muscle up. 

This forum is fantastic and I owe a lot of gratitude everyone who answered me. So thanks, guys.

1m0zhmt,weightroom,[Program Review] Used GZCL The Rippler (12 week) for a comeback to Powerlifting. April - July,"Well, its a been a while. After some setbacks in late 2023/2024, I stopped caring about training and stopped training for the 2nd half of the year also wasn't eating enough for the majority of the year and lost around 20KG of bodyweight. Started back in the gym in Jan 2025 at 70kg bw with weak lifts and done a simple 5x5 on my lifts for 4 months until April and that recovered a decent amount of strength and size. Then in April, I started the most interesting program I've probably have ran. GZCL The Rippler.

This is gonna be a rather long post below the results.

**RESULTS**

||Week 1 - April 2025 (Maxed out week prior)|Week 12 - July 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bodyweight |79KG|80KG (+1KG)|
|Squat|150KG|170KG (+20KG)|
|Bench|92.5KG|105KG (+12.5KG)|
|Deadlift|210KG|230KG (+20KG)|
|Overhead Press|60KG|70KG (+10KG)|

 Now whats funny is that in Late 2023 I reached my strongest at 90KG BW with S/B/D/OHP = 155KG/112.5KG/220KG/72.5KG. But I have now surpassed my lifetime Squat and Deadlift now at 10KG lighter. I am very happy with these results. 

Unlike previous programs I've ran, I tried my best to adhere to the programme. Honestly some weeks, I did go for a heavy single but overall this programme, I also didn't go balls to the wall with ALL AMRAPs especially deadlifts. I didn't really hit any PRs until week 8-12 (Block 3), which began with the wicked 9x1+ week, which in hindsight, I think I needed to do to create some momentum. I also think although the programme was intense, it did have some good 'easier' weeks throughout e.g. week 7,10 to manage fatigue.

I also loved the push for Secondary T2s: I did RDLs, Incline Bench, Squats and Barbell Rows. Most weeks, I was hitting PRs with the AMRAPs. For the first 8 weeks, I also focussed a lot on accessories T3s, especially arms, shoulders and back. This is where I went balls to the wall with my AMRAPs, not really my primary lifts. I was hitting weekly PRs I've never hit before and I think this translated well to the primaries. But also, I've never really focussed on accessories like this before so newbie gains maybe. I still have a TON of room to grow muscularity wise. 

Overall (each lift in more detail):

1. OHP didn't progress as well because of the lack of volume - I did it once a week with the same schemes as deadlifts, I needed more volume. On week 12, 70KG actually moved like RPE 8 so I thought 75KG would be doable. I attempted 75KG twice and failed both annoyingly. Going forward, although I enjoy the lift, I will be focussing my attention on benching more and using OHP as a secondary lift.

2. Deadlifts also felt weirdly off during the entire program, unlike other programs I've ran e.g. nSuns, there felt like a lack of volume in this program and I lost confidence as I didn't do my routine singles either. I did hit a big lifetime PR on week 9, 195KG 1x7. I remember I was attempting 1rms almost weekly in nSuns on top of the prescribed program. It gave the idea that I was progressing every week. With this program, I ended up hitting 230KG which I couldn't have imagined in week 1 scanning the program. During the program, the prescribed weights didn't even pass 205KG for a single i think. I hit 212.5KG out of spite in week 11, it felt like RPE 9 and it was strapped. Week 12, I hit 222.5KG (PR). I was planning to stop it here as it felt like RPE 9 but my friends pushed me to do 230KG which I somehow got. If they weren't there, my new training max would've been 7.5KG lighter than what it actually is.

3. Squats followed the same trend with deadlifts a bit, although I treated it both as a Primary T1 and a secondary T2. I enjoyed this and pushed the AMRAPs a bit, hitting a PR as early as week 2. On week 1, I input a true max (at the time) of 150KG. Not gonna lie on week 5 I maxed out and got 155KG (PR), week 6 I maxed out and got 160KG (PR). I also got other rep PRs on AMRAPs. Week 10, I went for 160KG and it moved like RPE 8/9. Week 12, I went for 165KG (PR) and 170KG (PR). The 170KG was RPE 10 and I can't believe I got it. 

4. Bench, even with the 1x a week volume, I think most of my progress came from pushing incline bench and actually doing relevant accessories. I didn't actually hit any Rep PRs on bench or OHP during the programme itself., but again my last PRs were done at a 10KG heavier bodyweight. I will be upping the volume to 2x or 3x a week now.  


**Nutrition** 

I basically ate the same thing every day since April. Never in my life have I ever been this strict with tracking and diet. I wanted to maintain my weight this time. I fell for the dirty bulking facade in my first 2 attempts of gaining weight. As a result, spending months losing weight I didn't need to gain. 3000 calories slowly upping to 3200 towards the end. Gained 1 solid KG in 12 weeks and I'm glad that is all I gained. I will keep at this slow rate for the foreseeable future.  

(Edit) Also learnt that carbs are an actual cheat code, especially fuelling before a session.

Supplements - Multivitamin, Vitamin D, Creatine, Protein Powder, added salt to my water.

  
**WHAT I HAVE LEARNT AND GOING FORWARD**

I think my mindset shifted the most during this program. This is the first time, I was receptive and open to the idea of good recovery management (as weird as that sounds) and using RPE as well as the prescribed percentages. Standard Beginner programs and my skewed perception of what progress and hard work looks like due to social media (truthfully) led me to believe every session needs to be max effort and strenuous. I often thought, whats the point of going to the gym if the session isn't heavy and challenging.I took it literally and yes, while I made progress back then, I was also new(er), injury prone but I also made similar progress now on this program by prioritising recovery and auto-regulating, without maxing out too often. If I put in my new deadlift max of 230KG for example into a program, I will notice most programs wont even come close to say 220KG - 230KG until the final weeks. Something to get used to I guess. Train hard of course but equally recover hard and treat it like a lifestyle if it means that much to you. Going forward, I will be prioritising and pushing my secondaries and accessories hard whilst making sure most of my sbd lifts are good quality, speedy and explosive reps. Building momentum to hit PRs and heavy weight like I did on this program. I will also be increasing volume on my bench. 

Even though I've joined the gym 4 summers ago, I now do often think about the amount of time I've wasted either: 1) not being intentional 2) not being consistent in training e.g. 2024 3) cutting down fat I didn't need to gain in the 1st place 4) training stupid, spinning my wheels leading to injuries. This lost time quickly added up to maybe 2 years of not actually progressing with my lifts.  I could've been much further down the path had I just lean bulked from the start, actually followed a program properly and recovered well. Lesson learnt the hard way. Down the line, I do wish to have the chance to compete in powerlifting one day and actually do well. 

I will be following [this beginner powerlifting program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OtS7aO0F9WgawLjmIkvYr9yuGFCnTAqFA1sXOchSJ-U/edit?gid=501472613#gid=501472613) by YANDO (a UK powerlifting coach) for the next 12 weeks.

1jv74y3,weightroom,SBS Hypertrophy Program (First Run) Review,"My stats prior to beginning SBS Hypertrophy 

* 28/29 years old, 193lbs
* Squat: 485x1
* Bench: 342x1
* Deadlift: 556x1

  
I ran the Hypertrophy program in a very lean bulk over 17.5 weeks. A coach I wanted to work with only had 2 spots left, so I decided to cut 2.5 weeks of the program out at the end. I wanted to be fresh and ready to go with my coach starting next week (especially since I skipped the last scheduled deload for this program, and the fatigue kicked my ass today). 

* I ran the 6x weeks version, sometimes training 7x a week, sometimes training 5x. I just made sure to complete the lifts for the program 
* I tried to do the first block (6 weeks) with an additional deadlift movement. I did that for 3 weeks and realized it was a bad idea 
* Primary lifts: Squats, Bench, Deadlift, Swiss Bar bench 
* Secondary lifts: SSB bar squat, Paused Kabuk transformer bar high bar squat, close grip bench, wide grip bench, trap bar deadlift, DB OH Press 
* I did WAY more accessories than Greg recommends. I averaged around 10 sets of belt squats and 4 additional sets of barbell squats each week. 
   * I also did 9-10 sets TOTAL of good mornings, RDLs, or reverse hyper extensions each week 
   * I also added lots of upper body volume 
* Supplements: Creatine and protein powder 

**Results**

* I gained about 5-8lbs of body weight over the course of the program. I need to eat more. 
* My strength on squats and ability to do high rep squat sets grew immensely. Sets I am really proud of for my lower body:
   * 440lbs for 8 on Week 17 of the program: [https://www.reddit.com/r/strength\_training/comments/1jpnzwy/440lbs\_for\_8\_reps\_196lbs\_bw/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/strength_training/comments/1jpnzwy/440lbs_for_8_reps_196lbs_bw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

   * 455lbs for 3, while super fatigued today: [https://imgur.com/a/9voWpk6](https://imgur.com/a/9voWpk6). I decided maybe it wasn't a squat day today, tried to deadlift the weight prescribed today, couldn't even pick up 490lbs of deadlift for a single. If I can do squats at that weight, on a bad day; that's good progress 
* My deadlift and deadlift accessory sets also improved quite a bit: 
   * 475lbs is now super easy: [https://imgur.com/a/mSFFUrI](https://imgur.com/a/mSFFUrI)
   * I'm doing high rep good mornings like they are nothing (335lbs for 16): [https://imgur.com/a/PzetrrY](https://imgur.com/a/PzetrrY)
* My upper body has blown up in size, and I believe I could probably get a 10lb bench PR right now 
* My quads have grown a bunch 
* I'm at a lower body fat % now than when I started

1gvhvml,weightroom,[Program Review] Mass Made Simple,"Hi all, I am more of a lurker than participant around here, but I finished Mass
Made Simple a few weeks back and started on Building the Monolith.  I thought
people might like hearing about MMS and how the transition into another program goes,
so I wrote up my experiences.

## Perspective of the Review

I completed all seven weeks of Dan John's Mass Made Simple.  Now I have
completed the first three weeks of Jim Wendler's Building the Monolith.  I
would like to cover the results of Mass Made Simple, and how it prepared me to
run BTM (so far).


## What is Mass Made Simple?

A book written by Dan John, which includes a full plan for six weeks of
training, eating, recovery, and assessment to add mass (that will largely be
lean) to your body.  At the end of the program you should be a bit more jacked
and understand what got you there.  There are six weeks of designated workouts
followed by one week to recover and assess the program.

You will do some pressing, back and core work, a barbell complex, and back
squats.  The training program does not look bad on paper.  To paraphrase Dan,
try it and see.

The squat challenge is to achieve 50 reps with bodyweight in one set.  The
program is a systematic approach to get closer to this goal, building you up in
what I felt was a very smart method.

The barbell complex includes a clean.  My clean technique is best described as
a deadlift followed by a reverse curl with momentum, which I believe is quite
bad.  It did not prevent me from doing the complex because the barbell weight
is limited by the overhead press that comes later.  Maybe it was a bad idea,
but I completed the program including the cleans without injury.


## Training Background

I am 39M with roughly 2.5 years of barbell training experience with pretty 
reasonable programs.  I started with a beginner linear progression, then 5/3/1 
templates, and Easy Strength when I wanted to do more running.  I ran a John
Meadows program as well.

I spent my youth playing a lot of different sports and my adulthood occasionally
running a 10K/half marathon and doing some easy calisthenics when I felt
myself getting too out of shape.  The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that like
most of us, I am not an athletic outlier by genetics/nature/birth/whatever.


## Results

We can start at the end, because outcomes are important.  All units are pounds.
My height is roughly 5'9""/176cm.

| Attribute              | Prior PRs             | After              |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| MASS!                  | 181                | 189                |
| Squats with Bodyweight | 21 reps (with 205) | 30 reps (with 185) |
| Squats 5x5             | 230                | 260                |
| Squat 1RM              | 315                | 315 (did not re-test) |
| Bench Press 1RM        | 235                | 245                |
| Bench Press 2RM        | 220                | 235                |
| Bench Press 5RM        | 210                | 215                |
| Deadlift 1RM           | 405                | 405 (did not re-test) |

This is Mass Made Simple.  The mass is what matters most.  I am plenty happy
with the weight I have gained.  My shorts are tighter around my thighs, but
the waist is still comfortable.  Admittedly, my abs are a bit...blurrier. I 
have chosen not to care about that for a while.

I hit the 30 squat reps on Workout 11 (out of 14).  That was my best
breakthrough.  I took a step forward to re-rack at 27 reps, decided I would be
angry with myself if I quit, reset and hit another 3 reps.  I really think this
experience was the biggest result from the program.  Doing the high reps there
would be plenty of points where I wanted to stop.  But as long as I did one
more rep, I could do a few more without wanting to stop (too much).  On the 30
rep set that stopped happening.  I desperately wanted to quit on every rep
after about 23.  Previously if I had two or three reps like that, I stopped the
set.  This was the mental breakthrough day.

I started my next program already and hit 260lb for 5x5 on day one.  It felt
very good, even though I never squatted more than 185lb in the previous seven
weeks.  So my experience is that I can do some lighter high rep squats, but
jump back to heavier weights with no problems.  Though ""heavier"" probably means
a lot more than 260 for a lot of lifters.

I have no idea what my max squat would be if I attempted it right now.  I hit
the 315lb squat on 2024-02-19.  But at least that gives you some idea how
good/bad I was at squatting at the start of the program.

The bench press PRs are nice, but the context makes me even happier.  On 
2024-05-28 I only hit 3 reps with 215 for an AMRAP set.  The 5RM with 215 came
on a day with a 2-3-5 cluster, and I hit it twice.  The 245 1RM happened when
I was going for a 2RM, because that first rep was by no means a grinder.  I
never actually attempted a 1RM, even though it is in the program as an option.

There is no deadlift in this program.  The closest thing I suppose is the
clean.  The most I cleaned was 125lb.  I have not re-tested my 1RM, but in week
1 of BTM I did 3 sets of 5 reps with 330lb.  It felt tough, but doable.  For
comparison, a few months ago I got 7 reps with 345lb for an AMRAP set.  I think
it is fair to say I have not lost much strength on the deadlift. So for the
level I am at, there was not any reason to worry about not deadlifting for six
weeks.

So overall the program has delivered on mass.  Based on the way my heavier
volume work is going so far, it certainly seems like it is muscle mass.  Sorry
if you want 1RM measurements for strength, but I am not interested in testing
right now.


## Experience Running the Program

### Nutrition

My core nutrition plan was based primarily around a lot of homemade food.

* Oatmeal made with milk.  Added some dried fruit, 2 tablespoons each of chia
  seeds, hemp hearts, and ground flax.  At some point I added 1 scoop (1/2
  serving) of casein protein powder as well.
* A lunch of grilled chicken, beef tri tip, or tofu plus a vegetable.  Grilling
  a big batch of protein on the rest days was incredibly helpful.  I like my
  vegetable chopped and mixed with some good sauerkraut, the fermented kind
  with nice seasoning in the refrigerated section.  Huge portion size on the
  protein here.  Added a few eggs sometimes.
* A dinner with protein, vegetable, and a grain.  Maybe a legume as well.  
* PB&Js between meals, often with a cup of milk.

Often I would have a second lunch, or just dip into my supply of grilled
tri-tip for a little snack.

The supplements I used were

* Daily fish oil capsules
* Creatine when MMS called for it
* Protein powder when MMS called for it


### Training That Went Well

Basically everything.

For a program known for the squats, I thought the upper body work was great. I
already covered bench press with my results. The one arm press in 2-3-5
clusters were tougher than they sounded.  They were also pretty fun!  I am not
sure what it was, but I think something good happened with my back because of
the bat wings.  This was the biggest surprise of the program for me.  The rows
in the complex just started feeling better.

I know the squats are talked about a lot, but do people realize how exhausting
the barbell complex can be?  Okay, sure, I will just do 5 rows then 5 cleans
then blah blah blah.  The weight does not sound too bad.  But there are six
movements in the complex.  If I do 30 reps of anything with a barbell, I will
be at least a little winded by the end of it.  Keeping your rest periods
reasonable, it gets pretty tiring in the later sets.  So I could really feel
how this would be good for conditioning.  Then I start doing some rounds with
lower reps and heavier weights.  It is still exhausting, but in a different
way.

The 50 reps of back squats are the infamous part of the program. The systematic
approach feels both reasonable and brutal.  The early workouts with light
weight are great for acclimating you to the challenge.  Once I made it to the
50 rep workouts, I learned a lot about myself.  Specifically, these attempts
told me where I am mentally, and what I need to change.  The weird part was
that I did not constantly want to quit throughout the set, but occasionally
there would be an overwhelming impulse to not get the next rep.  If I hit the
next rep, I could at least get a few more after before the impulse to quit came
again.  The in-between reps still sucked, but for some reason the impulse was
not there.  Usually I quit if the impulse came for 2 or 3 consecutive reps.

Oh, and they made my quads and glutes very, very sore.


### Training That Did Not Go Well

The final week.  My last two workouts actually saw a drop in my performance on
the squat.  My sleep and work stress was bad that week, but I honestly think it
was primarily a mental block.  I am pretty disappointed in myself about that.
Oh well, next year will be better.

The bird dogs might have had some important effect.  If so, I did not notice
it.

I suspect I could have gone for daily walks and gotten similar results.  I work
a desk job at home.  My physical activity has to be intentional.


## Big Lessons Learned

Bulking is not merely about the right training program.  It must include proper
training, nutrition, and recovery.  This program is quite specific about all
parts, and that the commitment to gaining must extend beyond lifting days.  I
think that makes it a great way to start a training block, or maybe for
someone's first serious gaining attempt.

An absolute stud or studdette would get the 50 reps done.  I did not get the 50
reps done, so I must relinquish any and all claims of studliness I wish to
make.

I am an overthinker.  I thrive on training plans that simply say, ""Do this.""
Give me options and I will just try to think my way to getting jacked. So far
this has been ineffective.


## Final Verdict on MMS Alone

I have every intention of running this program again.  Between the

1. mass gained,
2. gaining lifestyle strategies learned, and
3. ability to dig deeper and get more reps,
Mass Made Simple has given me a lot.


## How is the transition to Building the Monolith?

Bulding the Monolith is another bulking program, see
[this](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size)
for full details.  It has 3 lifting days and 3 conditioning days.

I have completed three weeks so far, and am love-hating it.

MMS and BTM similarities I have noticed:

* Simplicity.  There are not dozens of different exercises in either program.
* Difficulty.  Done right, neither program is easy.
* High rep squats.  MMS simple is even higher rep and more frequent, but they
  are present in both.

MMS and BTM differences I have noticed:

* BTM has dedicated conditioning days, whereas MMS has dedicated recovery.
* BTM has a lot more pulling work.  Many chin-ups, rows, shrugs, curls, and
  deadlifts.
* BTM has heavier squatting for one day per week.

Here are the things going well so far:

* Heavier squatting feels tough, but very good.
* Deadlifting after weeks without it is fine.  I am as strong as ever.
* Conditioning days feel great to be doing again.  The complexes must have done
  something good for my aerobic system, even though I am not as conditioned as
  I have been previously.
* All the pressing and dips.  I decided on doing Friday's pressing as EMOM due
  to the fairly light weight.  That felt like a good choice for the first week,
  and I credit the 2-3-5 clusters in MMS.
* The widowmaker squat set seems like it will get tougher, but it is just not a
  problem yet.

These are the big challenges in BTM so far:

* Upper back work.  The chin-ups are especially rough to jump back into. That
  is it.

So far, this feels like a great follow-up to MMS.  It is quite challenging but
manageable.  The volume of pulling work is probably a good thing after the
relatively lighter pulling volume in MMS.  Not to get ahead of myself, but this
is shaping up to be a very productive block of training.

**INTRO**

* Let me start at the end: buy this book.  I say that because, in the past, I asked about this book and was told by several people “You wouldn’t get anything out of it.  You’ve been training long enough that everything in it will be obvious to you.  If you’ve read the other Tactical Barbell Books, you already know all of this.”  And, like a sucker, I BELIEVED those folks, and that kept me away from this VERY enjoyable book.  And perhaps it’s because I’ve been slogging my way through Robert Sikes “Ketogenic Bodybuilding” book (which, I love Rob for his contributions to the field, but that book is DRY), but this was a total breath of fresh air, an easy and captivating read, and my favorite style of book: an “all-in-one” that manages to NOT be an 800 page tome.  So, with that, let me discuss this book, what is in it, why I like it, and why you should buy it.

**WHAT IT IS**

* The title really spells it out: this is the book that gets written when the dude behind “Tactical Barbell” writes a mass gaining book.  For those totally unfamiliar with Tactical Barbell: it’s a series of books written from the perspective of a dude with a background in special forces/operations AND SWAT style law enforcement.  It is this background that vectors his approach to physical training, similar to Brian Alsruhe’s background in counter-terrorism and martial arts.  In turn, his books (up until this point) were about building a “high speed/low drag” sorta athlete: well conditioned to be able to endure many hardships and be physically capable across multiple domains while also being strong for their bodyweight: NOT a 300lb strongman competitor.

* This background definitely comes to play in the Mass Protocol, because even though the goals have shifted, the philosophy and methodology remain the same.  It’s still very simple, to the point, reliant on a limited number of high return movements, based around percentages, with an emphasis on recovery and performance vectored toward the GOAL of improving mass specifically vs performance.  And, in turn, the author sets out to provide you ALL the tools you need to succeed.  By his own words, he “Army-proofed” the book, so anyone can make it work.

**WHAT’S INSIDE**

* This is what really won me over about the book: it’s absolutely the kind of book you could give to a trainee on day 1 and say “Read this, do what it says, and you’ll succeed”, AND it even gives you the tools to be able to say “Do this for the rest of your life and you’ll be fine.”  

*BASE BUILDING*

* After the book establishes intent with the reader, it starts out with a “Base Building” program, which already won me over.  As it sounds, Base Building is about getting in shape TO train: a CRUCIAL step that many new trainees attempt to bypass, which results in them failing HARD and early in their training.  I’ve lamenting on many occasions how the modern trainee tends to have a sedentary childhood, and lack of athletics/physical activity significantly hamstrings them compared to their peers that grew up playing sports year round, climbing trees, swimming in lakes, and in general just being what a kid is SUPPOSED to be.  Base Building will ideally help recover from that neglect: it’s based around VERY light weights at high repetitions for the weight training portion of the programming, followed by walking on non-lifting days as a means to improve conditioning.  Interestingly enough, the author ALSO speaks about the necessity of Base Building for those coming into Mass Building from a strength/power perspective: remarking on how all their time spent in the lower rep ranges to build maximal strength has unprepared them for the type of rep work in the Mass protocol.  From my own experience of going from drinking the Pavel “no more than 5 reps” Koolaid to repetition effort work in Westside Barbell, I can attest to that reality: I was “strong”, but that all went away when I tried to do a set of 12.

*MASS BUILDING*

* From Base Building, the book transitions to the actual Mass Protocol, broken down into 2 different sections: General Mass building, and Specialization.  Once again: the naming conventions are on-the-nose: General Mass Building are the programs one would use to add some general size to their frame, and specialization is what Stuart McRobert would refer to as a “finishing” program, or what John McCallum would refer to as…specialization.  It comes full circle folks.  5/3/1 BBB would be a great example of a “General Mass” style program: limited movements with a focus on hard work, whereas Building the Monolith could be seen as specialization: greater variety of assistance work and the emphasis on the yoke.

*PROGRAMMING*

* Without giving out ALL the content of the book, there are about 4 different General Mass programs and 2 different Specialization ones, each designed for 3 week blocks, based on a percentage of your 1rm, after which time you’ll up the 1rm weight and continue.  The author advocates a block/phasic approach to training based around these two protocols, with emphasis on one or the other dependent upon the trainee’s current proximity toward their goals.  He actually has an entire section dedicated specifically toward discussing how to set up training blocks with these protocols in order to set up training blocks of various lengths (which is why I wrote that we could give this to a trainee and give them tools for life), and even includes ways to integrate programming from previous Tactical Barbell books to be able to set up phases of strength, hypertrophy and conditioning training.  I really REALLY love that.  Much like what Jim Wendler did with 5/3/1 Forever, but even MORE prescriptive, for those that choke on freedom.

*CONDITIONING*

* It should shock absolutely no one that I was eager to get to the conditioning section of the book.  Despite the fact that “Tactical Barbell II” is one of my favorite books because it contains SO many conditioning ideas, the author does a fantastic job of “keeping the goal the goal” here and prescribes conditioning protocols that are VERY bare bones and utilitarian to the cause of gaining mass.  He frequently reminds the reader that the goal of mass building is TO BUILD MASS, and conditioning can quickly take away from that IF over/incorrectly utilized, thus he programs conditioning that is short and effective without so much intensity that it will burn out the trainee.  Conditioning requirements differ between the General Mass programs and the Specificity programs, which is even more incentive to alternate between the two: an opportunity to vary your conditioning.  Yet again: I really dig the prescriptiveness of this. 

*NUTRITION*

* I’ll admit flat out that I’m not a fan of the approach in the nutrition section, but I recognize this is a “me” issue.  The author prescribes an approach based around macro and calorie counting, laying down the exact amount of calories the trainee should eat, how much protein they should eat, and then a macro percentage breakdown to determine how much else to eat to achieve their goals.  I KNOW this method WILL flat out work: it’s just not how I like to do things.  Along with that, he’s very adamant about the necessity of carbs for the process of mass building, but he DOES at least on multiple occasions say things to the effect of “I don’t recommend a low carb/keto approach to mass building…but maybe you can get away with it”, which I’ll take as full license to do exactly that.

* But what I REALLY appreciate about the nutrition section is the blunt force instrument employed to the reader regarding WHY we’re eating this way: to gain mass.  The author makes a point to say it’s better to overeat than undereat, that the hard work of the program is going to limit fat gain, that when we’re gaining mass we need to do the things necessary to actually gain mass, etc.  The constant reinforcement of this is key, especially with so many junior trainees that are so brainwashed by the “365 abs” of social media that the notion of ever letting their midsection get blurry in the pursuit of actually putting on some muscle is completely alien.  It’s refreshing to see someone really take nutrition to task.

* The author also does a great job of emphasizing the value of wholesome, quality foods to achieve the nutrition goals, and he doesn’t shy away from meat to get protein.  There is no appeal to a plant based approach here.  He brings up quality protein supplements as well to bridge nutritional gaps, includes a brief discussion on supplements, advocates for a weekly cheat day, and does NOT try to find a way to make alcohol fit in the program.  He even includes specific recommendations for skinnier trainees vs fatbody trainees, and details how to eat during the Base Building blocks vs the other blocks.  Once again: everything you need to succeed.

*SUMMARY*

* Once again, I am reviewing the book here, rather than the method, simply because I haven’t had an opportunity to employ it (yet: I’m excited to give it a try!).  That said: this book is awesome.  Its $10 on amazon and gives you all the tools you need to succeed in your training.  It can be read in an afternoon, and re-read multiple times for inspiration.  Even if none of this is new to you, it can be incredibly refreshing to strip things down to the basics and remember the HOW and WHY behind what we do.

* Buy this book.",2024-09-06 18:40:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1famkp1/book_review_tactical_barbell_mass_protocol/

# Introduction

My lifting journey started at the end of 2018/beginning of 2019. I was 21yo and an [omega twig](https://imgur.com/0HcJHSH), with daily back pains due to escoliosis and lordosis; tight-ass hips; anterior pelvic tilt (much more accentuated on the right side); weighing 58 kg (127lb) at 180cm (5'10). I bulked until the pandemics started to a [less twig version of myself](https://imgur.com/a/XZpxYQu), and life was better in many regards. I started with the famous Reddit PPL, then did some GZCL, and nSuns. So basically followed the old r/fitness playbook. I might refer to this period as my ""First Big Bulk"" throughout this report, since this is my main basis for a long window of gaining.

The pandemics started, I did [home workouts](https://imgur.com/a/yD30A2s), and finally went back to the gym in 2021. There, I started with 5/3/1, and besides some short periods or another of other programs like PHAT, PHUL, Candito, and Smolov Jr, I always went back for the Wendler programs. I mainly did windows of either bulking with BBB, or cutting with Leviathan. My all-time highs for my lifts was a [150kg (335lb) squat @75kg (165lb) bw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nICrwO7mLP4?si=3S3dBmtxqQ-J6SfS), a [180kg (4pl8s) deadlift @80kg? (175lb but don't remember bw exactly) bw](https://youtube.com/shorts/HzenQDrUqoU?si=ptjnpPmn6W_5DPtr), and a 75kg (165lb) bench press @80kg (175lb) bw, no vid. Yes, an awful bench, long-ass arms, very small frame, so it's always been hard, but also improving (albeit slowly) so I'm ok with it.

I set two long-term goals for myself back when I started lifting: Being part of the 2/3/4 club and running the famous Building the Monolith program. I got the 3 and 4 pl8s in 2022 and beginning of 2023, far from the 2 pl8 bench press still but will get there eventually. BtM, on the other hand, either I felt too weak (at the start of my journey), or I felt ready, but not the right time. Uni, work, summertime, traveling, I was always postponing it for a ""better time"".

Then, this year I was planning what I wanted to do fitness-wise after a short cut followed by a trip I would do in March-April, and realized it was a great time to run it. Winter was coming (I live in Brazil), I'm done with uni, work is chill (SWE working from home, flexible hours), so it was the perfect time to do BtM. Then I realized I had much more time than that and wanted a bigger bulk, and that's when I decided to run u/MythicalStrength famous program. I had another trip planned for September, so I wouldn't have the time to run it all, but 3/4 of it aligned perfectly.

# Goals

I had a few goals starting this, mostly from my learnings from my previous bulks.

- **Get my calories from quality foods**. My first big bulk was full of McDonalds and empty of salads. I wanted to cut most ultra processed shit, eat as clean as possible, so I could feel good. Also add a lot of veggies, fruits, and all that good stuff that I had been neglecting.

- **Work on conditioning**. Back when I started I felt like the fitness hivemind was that cardio would kill your gains, and I believed that. More recently, seeing guys like the Mythical himself, u/DadliftsnRuns/, u/gzcl, I realized how important work capacity is, and how cool it is to be strong and endure shit. And also how lame it is to hit the gym so much and get winded after a flight of stairs.

- **Not feel sick**. This is related to the first point, but I got all sorts of stomach issues, mainly gastritis. Bulking has always fucked me up, and it was a big concern going into a big window like this. My big first bulk had a lot of throwing up, acid reflux, and feeling nauseous, and I didn't want it this time around. To fix this, besides being smarter with my food choices, also meant having dinner earlier to not go to bed full, which is difficult on a bulk since there is only so much time to eat.
- **Train hard enough so food purpose is enduring training**. This was something that clicked for me after reading some of Mythical's texts. The idea that the workout can kick your ass so hard, and you can be so scared to shit while reading next week's workout plan, that the only way you are able to complete that is eating for it, so you eat because there's no other choice, opened my mind. Before, I kept training as usual with a caloric surplus. I wanted to do the ass-kicking way this time around.
- **Get bigger and stronger**. Need I say more? This is a bulk, and a long one, so this above all else.

# Mm.. Food

I basically ate the same things for most days. My diet consisted of:

- For breakfast: sandwiches (mozzarella, turkey, whole wheat bread, cottage cheese, maybe eggs, maybe ricotta), yogurt, peanut butter, whey, granola, fruits, maybe eggs
- For lunch: shit load of pasta with ground meat. Meat of all sorts, usually very lean mixed with fattier one (60/40?), prepared either in a simple way or in bolognese style with tomato sauces and vegetables. Orange juice. Big plate of veggies.
- Afternoon: same as breakfast
- Dinner: same meat as lunch, but usually with rice instead of pasta and lower quantities. I found out that rice helped my digestion at night and I was hardly nauseated the next morning.

Once a week maybe I would eat sushi, or a pizza, barbecue, or some burgers.

That is the bulk of it, but I'd also eat bananas, desserts, and eggs at different times of the day. I don't like having too many meals, I like bigger ones, and this worked well.

The quantities depended on my training. I did not count calories, I think for the first time in a big bulk. I really liked it, and I think not counting helped me have a healthier relationship with food, although I don't regret the time I counted since that helped my intuition and understanding on what is bulking and what is cutting. I estimate 2700-3500 kcal depending on the point I was.

For supplements, I take creatine, multivitamins, fish oil, magnesium, digestive enzymes, and vitamin C. I don't think I will be raising any suspicions here, but I am 100% natural.

# Singles Week

While I had some bigger lifts last year, they were in peaking periods or periods where I was heavier, and not something I could do anymore when I started this program in April, especially arriving from a ~3 week trip and a cut window before that. Thus, I took a week before to do some singles to calculate my TMs. I will be calling these testing periods as Singles Week, which is where I tested stuff without getting to a point of a true 1RM that would wreck me, but getting sort of close nonetheless, so a RPE 9 for lower body, and RPE 9.5-10 for upper body as that usually isn't go-back-home-lie-down-and-cry taxing for me. This is also the same method used for the deloads after each program. 

So after Singles Week 0, these were my stats:

||Pre-Mythical Mass|
:--|:--|
|Bodyweight |73kg (160lb) |
|Squat|120kg (265lb) |
|Bench|70kg (155lb) |
|Deadlift|150kg (330lb) |
|OHP|50kg (115lb) |
|Dips|50 in 6 sets|
|Chin-ups|50 in 9 sets|

# The program: Mythical Mass

For those unaware, [this is a sequence of four of the toughest programs out there](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/mythical-mass-26-week-bulking-program/). It starts with 6 weeks of 5/3/1 Beefcake, then 6 weeks of 5/3/1 Building the Monolith, then 6 weeks of DeepWater Beginner, then 6 weeks of DeepWater Intermediate, with a week of deload between each program, meaning the full program takes ~28 weeks. As mentioned, I did not do DeepWater Intermediate as I have a trip starting next week, so there was only time for 3/4 of it.

How the deload is programmed is not specified, at least I didn't find anything, so that is where the Singles Week comes in. Besides the singles, I also did some light accessories. So my deloads were mainly for cutting the volume and re-testing for next cycle.

I will go over each one of the programs, give a brief summary, describe any changes, how I felt, and my numbers after the Singles Week after each program.

## 5/3/1: Beefcake

This is a classic 5/3/1 program, very similar to BBB where you do 5x10 for assistance work. The change here is that these 5x10 sets are with FSL weight, i.e., same weight as the first 5/3/1 main set. Additionally, it lays down the accessories, and the 5x10 has to be done in under 20 minutes.

I was fairly used to BBB, so I didn't have too much trouble with the program. I was NOT used to chins and dips, so those kicked my ass at the beginning, and mondays were scary as it was squat day plus those fuckers. By the end of week 3, however, I was already used to them, and it didn't feel like too much anymore. I was doing the chins supersetting with my squats, and then finished whatever was left with the dips. I also managed to complete every 5x10 in under 20 minutes, except for the final week, where my bench presses took 22min. Doing the rows supersetted with the bench work was pretty tiring, but I dropped the ball here, I could have done in under 20.

I really like this program for long term bulking.

Beefcake Singles Week results:

||After Beefcake|
:--|:--|
|Bodyweight |77kg (170lb) |
|Squat|125kg (275lb) |
|Bench|75kg (165lb) |
|Deadlift|155kg (345lb) |
|OHP|50kg (115lb) |
|Dips|50 in 5 sets|
|Chin-ups|50 in 7 sets|


## 5/3/1: Building the Monolith

This was it. The reason I started all this, and one of my goals for over four years now. I was stoked.

For those living under a rock, [this](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101078918-building-the-monolith-5-3-1-for-size) is a big ""eat a lot and do a bunch of shit"" program by 5/3/1's Jim Wendler. It is a six days a week program, but you only lift weights in three. This does not make it any easier, it's ""only"" three because otherwise the body won't be able to take the absurd amounts of volume.

Reading the program, Mondays scared me a lot due to the 100 chins and 100-200 dips, and the widowmakers at Fridays too. Besides this, Wednesday seemed pretty chill, and the rest seemed alright as well.

I was wrong. Wednesday was a bitch, honestly. Getting tired with the deadlifts and supersetting the bench press with the dumbbell rows was rough. And, to my surprise, the widowmakers did not feel that horrible, at least not the 2-3 first ones. The sixth certainly did. All in all, all workouts were pretty rough here, I was constantly wrecked, and the cardio certainly helped with the work I had to put in. My workouts were taking around ~1h45-2h for Mondays, and 1h15-1h30 for the rest. I did a bunch of supersets whenever possible, like my chin-ups I'd do 4-5 supersetted with every exercise, and at the end there would be only a few sets missing. It was also my first time doing shrugs, and I actually liked the exercise, unexpectedly so.

I really liked the amount of squat and press volume, IMO the most badass lifts. All the upper body volume also really helps with the, sorry, upper body volume. The gains were really noticeable. I will certainly consider including high volume exercises like the shrugs and dips here in future routines.

In this program I also discovered the weighted vest walking. I did not get a 84lb as Wendler says, since I don't think I can even wear that, but a 10kg was pretty good, and something I incorporated for my cardio going further and will keep doing so. Planning on getting a 20kg one soon.

I tried the diet. For half a day. I was miserable. I gave up and settled for half of that: 6 eggs and 0.75lb meat a day, which was just a tiny bit over what I was eating. Not missing a single day of eating this still felt like a challenge, so I stuck to that and it was pretty good.

This is, by far, the best program I have ever run. By week 3 or 4 here was when people started noticing I was big, and I really felt that. Big traps, shoulders, back, hammering those upper body lifts WORKS. I will certainly run it again in the future, and the Beefcake -> BtM sequence felt amazing. That said, I was destroyed by the end of week 6, and glad it was over.

Singles Week after BtM:

||After BtM|
:--|:--|
|Bodyweight |82kg (180lb) |
|Squat|130kg (290lb) |
|Bench|80kg (180lb) |
|Deadlift|160kg (355lb) |
|OHP|55kg (125lb) |
|Dips|50 in 3 sets|
|Chin-ups|50 in 5 sets|

## DeepWater: Beginner

This is a five-days a week program by Jon Andersen, with four of those five days being lifting days. At the Beginner level (don't get fooled, beginner here does not means it is for beginners, it means a beginner to the deep water programs), there are two ""deep water sets'' per week, which is a 10x10 with 4 minutes of rest between sets for the first two weeks, then 3 minutes for the next two, then 2 minutes. It is done for the squat/deadlift (alternating) on Mondays, and press/push press (alternating) on Wednesdays. The ebook with the program can be found for free in Jon's website.

The changes I did here was including the rows and shrugs every Tuesday, since in the program it is one or another depending on the week. Also did lateral raises regardless of press or push press. And also did press and push press alternating, instead of double press in the final weeks as in the program, which felt weird (and possibly a typo?).

I read some review that mentioned DeepWater being like spiraling into madness, and I understand why. The feeling of the clock ticking and you know in a minute you will have to be under the bar, and you are already dead, but it doesn't matter, and you barely did 6 sets so there are a bunch more to complete, is a DREAD. My DOMS after the Monday workout would last until Friday at the very least. The final deep water deadlift was the hardest shit I've ever done in my life, I think.

That said, besides the Mondays, the program is… Ok. Nothing to write home about. Some of the stuff felt a little pointless to me since I wasn't continuing with the intermediate deep water, like the clean pull techniques. It was my first time doing push presses too, which were fun, but unless I run deep water again I think I'll stick to the regular presses.

This program is where I started to count all my rest times. Obviously done for the DeepWater sets, but also did for everything else. It is definitely something I will incorporate better in future workouts and goals (do more shit with less time).

While I feel like my best gains here were mental, I made some cool physical gains as well. I didn't feel it was as powerful as BtM, but my legs, butt, back, shoulders, have gained from this program.

Singles Week after DW:

||After DW|
:--|:--|
|Bodyweight|85kg (187lb) |
|Squat|140kg (315lb) |
|Bench| 80kg (180lb) |
|Deadlift|170kg (375lb) |
|OHP|55kg (125lb) |
|Dips|50 in 3 sets|
|Chin-ups|50 in 5 sets|


# Conditioning

Heavily inspired by some of the legends in this subreddit, my plan originally was to do something every day. If I wasn't lifting weights in a particular day, I'd do cardio. This could be a 45min walk, air bike, real bike, inclines, stairs, weighted vest walks, and also crossfit style HIIT workouts, mainly the armor building complex.

My plan started amazing, and by week 5 of BtM (so like 2/3 of the full program done) I started slacking. That's when I moved apartments, had a busy hard week, and didn't pick it back up. Week 6 of BtM was the first week I missed a day of ""doing something every day"", and for DeepWater, for most weeks, I had two days of full rest, so basically did just the program as described with no additional cardio besides the day the program states. It is definitely something I view as extremely important and will try to get back on top of it for future programs.

# Conclusion

All Singles Weeks results:

(Height is 180cm, or 5'10). Last deadlift has video :)


And let's revisit the goals.


- **Get my calories from quality foods**, **Not feel sick**: Clamping these into one. Yes, my calories were mainly from high quality sources. Added a lot of veggies, and a big shout out to Sauerkraut (home-made, natural fermentation) which I believe really helped my stomach. I tried kimchi as well but it wasn't to my taste, but it's a good option as well. As you can see from my food section, lots of grains, whole food, eggs, fruits, etc. I felt GOOD throughout all of it, and I didn't vomit even once :P I still deal with gastritis and acid reflux, but it's improved a lot. I will give myself a B+ here because I could be eating more fruits and have more variety overall in what I eat besides always eating the same stuff.

- **Train hard enough so food purpose is enduring training**: My workouts were the hardest I've ever done. I was constantly scared to shit of my next workout, I was nervous going into some days. Many times I laid down on the gym floor, tired to death. I felt relief after some tough workouts, as they seemed impossible beforehand. More than once when programming the next cycle, I'd have the numbers and slightly increase one or another so it felt ""oh shit"". This is the first bulk in my life where eating and gaining weight was not something too forced, it was natural because my body yearned for that food. Shit, tomorrow is a deep water Monday? I need a big pizza or else I'm DONE. This is an A+.

- **Work on conditioning**: It could have been better, but the evolution was huge, and it pays off. I will give myself a C here, which is good enough, but there is room to grow.

- **Get bigger and stronger**. Yes! Numbers are not that impressive considering I have heavier PRs weighing less, but I feel like I have not realized my potential, and I'm a peaking cycle alway from much bigger numbers. I got much, much bigger, and I look big and strong (compared to myself, at least!). Traps, shoulders, chest, legs, back, everything. Yes, I'm carrying some fat now, I gained a LOT of weight after all, but I feel much leaner than I was at 5 kg/10lb lighter a year ago. And if I put on a shirt I look badass lol. I [took a picture of my back on my trip before running the program](https://imgur.com/a/KZhGMYv) to show a sunburn which serves a ""before"". So [here is a picture of my back now as ""after""](https://imgur.com/a/PwkTaFL). While yes, the ""before"" is without a gym for two weeks and after is ""after"" a gym day, you can see da boy is looking wide, even while carrying some additional fats. I'll give myself an A+ here as well, because it surpassed my expectations.

Mythical Mass, while could seem like just glueing tough programs together, makes sense. The curve makes sense. I'm not sure if I'll ever run this again, or finish it doing DeepWater Intermediate, but this was a great experience and I grew from it (literally) and will carry the learnings to whatever is next.

Sorry for not having more pictures, but I really don't like doing the befores and afters things or stuff like that, my north is either my numbers (for strength oriented programs) or how I feel when I look at the mirror (for size programs). Hope this review conveys this feeling properly.

# Next steps

Whatever program I run, I will definitely be much more strict with rest times. And I will keep working on my cardio. Another goal of mine is competing in a powerlifting meet, so maybe that's my goal for 2024, although meets seem to be scarce here in Brazil. Right now, though, I have almost a month without a gym ahead of me; I will be in Mexico eating and chilling, so I will reassess at the end of September :)

*INTRO*

* Any of my regular readers know just how big a fan I am of all-inclusive training books: one stop shopping that covers everything you need in order to get training and eating right.  Paul Kelso’s “Powerlifting Basics Texas Style” does a fantastic job of providing a wide variety of programs AND a fantastic discussion on the 3 main food groups (Tex-Mex, BBQ and Cajun) to get a trainee eating and training right, and even dives into coaching.  5/3/1 Forever quite literally gives you all the tools you need to train, well, Forever.  Marty Gallagher’s “Purposeful Primitive” is an insane value with how it covers lifting, eating, and cardiovascular training, “The Complete Keys to Progress” is exactly that, “Super Squats” and Deep Water, etc etc.  And this love for all-inclusivity also corresponds with a love for all things “high speed/low drag”.  I don’t need fluff or presentation: I want to get to the point and get out.  Heck, people that have observed my bare bones nutrition of meat touched by flame can see it unfold, alongside my strongman equipment cobbled together out of gorilla tape.  It’s also why I’m such a fan of Dan John vs some of our more “science based” authors out there, or why I care more about a good story vs a good study.  And, in a true display of irony, this longwinded bloviation of an intro was put here to introduce the idea I have for a 3 sentence training manual which may, in fact, become my second e-book:

>“Eat meat and eggs when hungry until no longer hungry.  Spend 180 minutes a week picking something up off the floor and putting it over your head.  Don’t repeat the same meal or workout twice in a row.”

**EAT MEAT AND EGGS WHEN HUNGRY UNTIL NO LONGER HUNGRY**

* There’s no perfect diet, sure, but man, if everyone ate JUST meat and eggs when hungry until not, think of all the junk they’re NOT eating, all the damage they’re NOT doing, all the good stuff they’re putting into their body (protein and monounsaturated fats). And this doesn’t require a sliderule and degree from Harvard to figure out (although I AM shocked at how many people don’t seem to know what is an animal vs a plant…)


* One of the “high speed/low drag” benefits of “eat meat” as a dietary prescription is how it avoids many of the issues trainees tend to have with food allergies and intolerances.  There are SOME meats out there that people can have allergenic reactions to (shellfish is notorious for this, and some folks can have reactions to pork and other animals), but beef, in particular, tends to be one of the least allergenic foods out there.  This is a boon because SO many times a trainee will ask for advice on how to eat and I’ll mention a wide variety of foods only for them to zero in on ONE of them and say “oh, I can’t eat peanuts, so peanut butter is out”. And rather than hold their hand and walk them to the MILLIONS of other choices available I tend to just get frustrated with the experience and wish them luck, as they’ve demonstrated just how much they fixate on the negative and refuse to engage in basic problem solving.  With our choices cut down, we earn MORE freedom, because we’ve eliminated SO many options that might trigger a negative biological response that there are only good choices available.  I say “meat” and you go from there.  There are SO many animals on the Earth that you’re bound to find one you can eat.  Yes: this will preclude vegans and vegetarians from succeeding.  You have the deepest condolences I can offer: you’ll have to walk your own path.


* Eggs occupy an interesting space in the allergysphere as well.  Eggs tend to have higher instances of an allergenic response compared to meat, but, often, it’s the egg WHITES that people respond negatively to vs the yolk.  In turn, one can attempt to abide by “meat and eggs” and simply opt for the yolks vs the whites and see how they suits them.  There’s a LOT of good stuff in those egg yolks as it is, so eating them isn’t a bad idea at all.  BUUUUUT, if worse comes to worse and eggs are taken off the table, it just means eating more meat.


* As a final aside to the aside, Dr. Ken Berry is a big fan of “Beef, Butter, Bacon and Eggs” as the answer to “what to eat”, with the helpful pneumonic of “BBBE”.  There’s methods to the madness too: beef remains one of the least allergenic meats out there, butter is a dairy product that few have a histamine reaction to as a result of the rendering out of proteins/lactose (which, if there is STILL an issue there, ghee can resolve it), bacon is simply magical, and whole eggs/egg yolks contain SO many awesome vitamins and nutrients.  And again, if we wanna talk high speed/low drag, boiling the list down to 4 foods definitely accomplishes that.  


* And then there’s learning about hunger cues: not eating based on a schedule but because we’re hungry, and then eating until we’re not (not until we’re “full”, not until there’s no more food on the plate, just because we’re not hungry). We also get to learn about the difference between “hungry” and “bored”. When ALL we’re eating is meat and eggs, if we’re hungry: we’ll eat it. If we’re not, we won’t. Caveat: there would be no sauces or seasonings, outside of salt. If we have to trick ourselves into eating the food, we aren’t hungry.


* It's worth observing that in no way am I advocating a means of achieving optimal health here.  That’s between you and your medical provider.  I am simply coming up with A high speed/low drag solution to the question of “what do I eat?”  If you have a BETTER approach: use it…but then, why did you come to me for answers?

**SPEND 180 MINUTES A WEEK PICKING SOMETHING UP OFF THE FLOOR AND PUTTING IT OVER YOUR HEAD**  


* Man, that just says it all. Much l like how the food is “when hungry, until not”, the pick the thing up and put it over your head can be “Do it until you can’t, wait until you can again, then do it again”. That answers the question about sets and reps. And if people REALLY want an answer, we could prescribe a time limit. And as I wrote that, I thought “how about a “per week” time limit?” That would REALLY streamline things. An hour a day, 3x a week is a very standard amount of “average human” training, so say we do that. 180 minutes. Split it up however you want now. You wanna train 7 days a week? Great: 25 minutes a day. Dan John would be proud. Can only train twice a week? 90 minutes each time. Man: imagine how goddamn strong you would get if, twice a week, you spent 90 minutes putting something over your head? That is a SCARY motherf**ker: especially if, after those 90 minutes, he puts away a dozen eggs and some steaks or ribs.


**DON’T REPEAT THE SAME MEAL OR WORKOUT TWICE IN A ROW**


* Forced variety/periodization. Don’t eat ONLY ground beef and eggs for every single meal: one meal, yes, the next steak and eggs (and hey, maybe chicken eggs for one meal and duck eggs for another, we can switch that up too), then ribs and eggs, pork chops and eggs, salmon and eggs, etc. For the workout, if ALL we have is a barbell, we’ll change the weights OR the way we got it over our head (snatch vs press), but if we have multiple objects, the world is our oyster. Kegs, stones, logs, sandbags, etc etc.


* The nutritional variety will cover our nutrient bases. The implement/movement variety will cover our imbalances.  It also dawns on me that, if I wanted to be cute, I could change that sentence to simply “Chaos is the Plan”, so that it reads “Eat and eggs when hungry until no longer hungry.  Spend 180 minutes a week picking something up off the floor and putting it over your head.  Chaos is the plan.”…but you’d have to “know” me to know what the hell that final part means.  But it also DOES communicate more than JUST “don’t repeat the same meal/workout twice in a row.”  Now we can use that third sentence to mean that, not only are we not repeating meals and workouts twice in a row, but perhaps we won’t repeat weeks in a row either.  Think about that: now we just created a training cycle.  
 

* When we employ the “Chaos is the plan” corollary to training, it means that some weeks our 180 minutes are divided between 2 workouts, sometimes 4, sometimes 7, etc.  And the change in amount of training days would result in a change in training time, which would naturally cause a waving of training volume by changing the training density or load employed to meet the training time.  Hey, isn’t a weekly change something we saw in 5/3/1, the Juggernaut Method, Dan John’s “1 lift a day”, basic western linear periodization, much of Alex Bromely’s programs, etc etc?  And what if we really DID make chaos the plan and used the roll of a die to determine how many days a week we were going to train THAT week?  Oh my god I’m loving this.


* And heck, we could even boil this down WITHIN a week.  Just because I’m training 180 minutes over the span of 4 days doesn’t mean they have to be evenly divided workouts.  Rather than 4 45 minute workouts, what if I had one 90 minute workout and 3 30 minute ones?  Or 2 75 minute workouts and 2 15 minute ones?  15-60-45-60?  The possibilities are limitless!


* And Chaos can be the plan with nutrition too.  Eat meat and eggs when hungry until no longer hungry.  Simple enough.  Don’t repeat the same meal twice in a row.  Simple enough.  Chaos being the plan means that some days we may simply just plain not eat.  If we’re not hungry, we’re not eating.  Or maybe we employ a protein sparing modified fast ala the Velocity Diet/Apex Predator Diet, or keep it full carnivore and rely on egg whites, chicken breasts, lean fish, etc and then do a day MUCH heavier on the fats.  I’ve heard some folks employ “fat fasting”: why not give it a go and see what happens?  A surefire way to take in a variety of nutrients is to eat a wide variety and methods of food, and through that we’ll learn just how our body responds to these foods to best maximize performance AND gain a little bit of metabolic flexibility to go along with it.


* That even lends well to cyclical nutrition, something Jamie Lewis has written about among several other authors.  This could be a golden avenue to employ something ala the ABCDE diet, or take Justin Harris’ carb cycling and put it on its head by doing fat/protein cycling instead.  Therein, just like with training, we observe instances wherein the nutrition can be rotated on a weekly basis or within the week itself.  And this can be done while STILL keeping the nutrition simple: meat and eggs.  There is SO much variety within those two things that we can have limitless possibilities available.  A grassfed sirloin is going to have a much different breakdown compared to a grainfed slab of prime rib, to say nothing of comparing that same grassfed sirloin to some pork ribs, or a pot roast, or chicken thighs/wings.  And wanna compare some quail eggs to an ostrich egg? And while we’re talking about eggs, think about how you can eat the same eggs but PREPARE them differently.  Fried, poached, hard/soft boiled, omelets (steak and egg omelets are the meals of warriors), raw, scrambled, etc.  John Meadows spoke to the idea that we can reduce the instances of egg intolerances by varying the method in which we prepare them on a frequent basis.  Chaos is the plan, and chaotic nutrition can exist in the realm of restriction.  

**EVERYTHING ELSE**


* I had actually already shopped this idea out and someone pointed out to me the value of an adding a walk to the prescription.  It was the greatest contribution I had seen to any protocol in a long time AND completely overlooked by me because I subscribe to Jamie Lewis’ paradigm that walking isn’t a workout “it’s part of being a human being”.  That said, it wasn’t UNTIL I took on “Feast/Famine/Ferocity” that I started walking daily, so I was living a sub-human lifestyle for quite a while as well.  As far as walking goes, there are several outstanding prescriptions out there to follow.  There’s a lot of great science speaking to the value of a 10 minute walk after meals, and with Chaos being the Plan as far as our eating schedule goes, this allows for a chaotic walking schedule as well…but it also means on those fasting days we won’t walk at all.  But, perhaps, since calories will be on the low side, that’ll be a good thing.  Jamie Lewis prefers a set prescription of “2 miles a day, minimum, outside, rain or shine”, which is also a great way to get in some vitamin D…when it’s sunny.  And Dan John’s Easy Strength for Fat Loss tackles it by having the trainee have a set 60 minutes of training, lift weights at the start, and go for a walk for the remainder of the 60 minutes.  Given it’s an Easy Strength workout, the lifting can last anywhere from 10-25 minutes, so you can get in some decent walks, and Dan wants to trainee to legit put the weight down and head out the door while the heart rate is still up.  All of these are great prescriptions, and all rely on the trainee to do SOME sort of walking, which is the big takeaway.


* Beyond that, I’d be a cad if I didn’t cop to still making use of nutritional supplements as part of a “safety net” for my carnivore based nutrition.  Everything I’ve read and heard says you can get all the required nutrients you need from animal products, and I find the position believable enough, but I also get my supplements for free from Biotest, and they make fantastic products.  They have also taken fantastic care of me through so much of my journey.  The big takeaway with the nutrition prescription was to provide a VERY solid working foundation.


* For the training, if I HAD to add something to it, it’d be pushing/dragging a sled.  I’ve often written that my “desert island training” protocol would be log vipers and prowler pushes, and that still holds true.  The sled will build up the legs just fine with a concentric only movement that’s easier to recover from to allow for more frequent training, and it provides ANOTHER avenue of conditioning AND a potential for level changes in a workout as well if one goes with low handles/low crawls and drags.  But, I’ll also die on the hill that this is an unnecessary addition.  Is one doing to develop some Tom Platz looking legs from picking something up off the floor and putting it over their head?  No, but I’m sure they could develop some Milo of Croton or Farnese Hercules legs from doing that…and really, do you need more than that?


* Another consideration I had was to either have a “dealer’s choice day” ala Jamie Lewis OR a caveat to take 10% of your training time each day and use it to train “whatever”.  I feel like this would do a good job of shoring up any issues trainees may have with imbalances, specific lifts that need bringing up, etc.  When we account for the fact that assistance work is responsible for 10% of our growth, it makes sense that we only spend 10% of our time on it.  So if you have a 25 minute training session, spend 2.5 minutes doing some assistance work.  Whether that’s an ADDITIONAL 2.5 minutes or 2.5 minutes out of your 25 minute total training session is between you and your god: just get it done.

**NOT THE END**

* I genuinely want to expand on this.  Look at how much could be done with just 3 sentences.  I can legit open up a book with those 3 sentences and then go on to list a jillion different “meat and egg” recipes in one portion alongside hundreds of “pick up off the floor and put overhead” workouts.  We could train our whole lives off these 3 sentences AND alongside the 3 principles of “Effort, Consistency and Time”.  The Freedom of limitation shines through yet again: give me 3 sentences and I’ll give you a book.",2023-08-11 15:13:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/15obkuc/chaos_is_the_plan_the_plana_3_sentence_training/
13lwj73,weightroom,Program Review: 2 Blocks of Building the Monolith,"**TL;DR** - I ran Building the Monolith as a Leader 2x, with an Anchor of PR Set and FSL sandwiched in. The first run went great! The second was less great

**Background:** I am 28/M/6'0"" I’ve been lifting consistently for just over 2 years. I’ve never considered myself strong or particularly muscular, and honestly still don’t, but I thought my experience might be valuable.

Building the Monolith is designed to make you monolithic. It’s (one of) Wendler’s answers to folks looking to get bigger.

**Changes to the Program:**
I Followed Wendler's recommendations that you do conditioning, but my main forms of conditioning were running, the elliptical, sled pushes, and kettlebells. No access to an assault bike so couldn’t do Jim’s recommended Day 6 conditioning workout. I did not follow the diet. I use MacroFactor and allowed robo-Greg to tell me how much to eat. I also sometimes ignored MF and just ate what I wanted, leading to a faster rate of gain than was necessary 

**Running the Program:**
My typical week looked like this:

* Sunday: Day 1 lifting, 90ish minutes in the gym
* Monday: 10 rounds of Armor-Builders, 1.5 mi run
* Tuesday: Day 2 lifting, sub 1-hr in the gym
* Wednesday: sled pushing/ humane burpees/ or run
* Thursday: Day 3 lifting, hr-ish in the gym
* Friday: 20 mins of elliptical or run
* Saturday: blessed day of rest

I ran everything at a confirmed 85% TM to start (5-6RM), and took jumps from there. I could not maintain the normal 10/5 jumps at the end, and was probably closer to a 90% TM after the Anchor. In hindsight I should have lowered the TMs further for the second go-round. This program really does not play nice with a too high TM

**Some thoughts on the program itself:**

* 100 chins was my white whale. I came into this with a max set of chins being ~8 at a BW of 188.6 The first Day 1 I started out doing triples and got the last few reps as singles. By the end I was doing sets of 5 for all 100 chins. I feel really great about my chin improvement even as BW came up.
* 5x5 LSL squats are murder if your Training Max is too high. I got buried a few times when my recovery was not on point and had to option down on a few of the sets. 
* My dips did not get better on this program, but my press exploded.
* This program really taught me what conditioning in 531 can look like. You can push it a lot more than you think.
* Conditioning is mando. I did a really good job of it for the first 6 week block, and a less good job of it in the second block (take a look at my expenditure and weight graphs to see the inflection point for this). I think that directly ties to my good results in the first block and less good results in the second block.


**Diet:**
Robo-Greg, aka MacroFactor, tells me what to eat these days. Only supplements were 5g of creatine daily and the caffeine present in my coffee. 80%+ of my nutrition were whole foods I made into meals myself. Think overnight oats with peanut butter for breakfast, beans/lentils with meat and cheese for lunch, or a bagel with cream cheese for a late night snack. The big spikes in cals consumed you’re seeing are from the times I chose fun foods out.

[Fancy MacroFactor charts](https://imgur.com/a/clK78rN)

**Results and Progress Made:**
The lifts are my TM/best sets performed during the program. The weights are in lbs. While this progress might look a little underwhelming for some people, keep in mind that every single starting number was a lifetime PR at the time, and every finishing number (except dips) is a lifetime PR.


|**Item**|**Start**|**Finish**|
:--|:--|:--|
|Weight|188|198|
|Deadlift|350|390|
|Squat|285|310|
|Bench|195|205|
|OHP|130|145|
|OHP|95x11|105x12|
|Dips|13x8|13x8|
|Chins|triples|20x5|

I also completed 17 rounds of ABCs in 5’ with 40# KBs for the kettleballs April challenge. This is great considering last year 20’ of EMOM ABCs I considered hard, near max effort conditioning.

I don’t have good before pics unfortunately, but suffice to say that people in my life have started to notice some size on my arms, back, and legs. Also my clothes have changed from being snug at the waist and loose in the thighs/shoulders to snug in the thighs/shoulders and loose at the waist, despite being up in BW.

**Conclusion:**
The goal was to get bigger and I succeeded. I honestly could have eaten slightly less, or perhaps conditioned a little harder, as I’m kinda forced to be done bulking now. I’ve added size all over, but I’m not willing to keep going as my waistline is about as wide as I’m comfortable with, and I’m honestly tired of all the cooking and eating. BtM remains a great, highly recommendable program. But probably do it once then move on to something else. I was a little bit beat up for the second run, and my willingness to keep the conditioning up just wasn’t there. Bulking is exhausting work, and doing a minicut anchor in between runs didn’t actually let me recover appropriately to give the second block 100% effort.",2023-05-19 14:10:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13lwj73/program_review_2_blocks_of_building_the_monolith/
13iblr9,weightroom,"[PROGRAM REVIEW] Jamie Lewis' updated ""Feast, Famine and Ferocity""","**INTRO**

If you’re not a fan of Jamie Lewis, originally of “Chaos and Pain” and now “Plague of Strength”, you’re not going to enjoy this piece, but I’m going to lead by saying Jamie has flat out changed my life all for the positive and I owe him a TON, and the least I can do is sing his praise, positively review his material and try to get others to buy from and support him.  So that’s what I’m going to do here.


Get the program here

https://plagueofstrength.com/the-feast-famine-and-ferocity-diet-is-now-updated-and-available-as-an-e-book/

I'm going to write this backwards, starting with the results, going into the program reviews, then the background.  I figure that's really what's important.

---

**STARTING WITH RESULTS**

* It’s so rare I do photos, [so appreciate this](https://i.imgur.com/uwkBgoj.png).  This isn’t 6 weeks purely on FFF, but the end of Super Squats and the final week of “Feast”, so about 9 weeks of change.  



* As far as lift results go, I genuinely hate detailing this stuff, since my training is so wild and difficult to track.  I’m gonna just shutgun some stuff here, but ultimately: I’m the strongest I’ve been in a LONG time while also the leanest.

*  From week 1 to week 4 of Feast, I went from only being able to do 3 rounds of EMOM 200lb log clean and press for doubles to getting through a full 8 rounds of it.

*  From 4 triples of SSB squats w/405 in the first week of Famine to 6 triples of 415 in the third week of Feast

*  4x2x321 axle bench in the first week of Famine, 10x2x301 in week 3 of Feast (with 1 minute rests vs 2+)

* But honestly, stuff like [this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbtDWEWJ8wA) is really what I find most impressive as far as results.  That’s an 11+4+3x405+chain mat pull, but the context is: I had been walking around the zoo for 6 hours that day, having only had a Metabolic Drive shake for lunch and then coming home from a solid [carnivore feast](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/e/1/d/e1d5ffdf73834fc67487531f81d2d921476cc598.jpeg), and I had 5 minutes before we were going to turn right around and walk the dog (get in my 2 miles).  I threw on some shorts I had on the laundry, warmed up with ONE rep of 155+chains, and then pulled that.  All the daily activity, new stuff I’ve been exposed to, good eating, etc etc has me fully healed and ready to move and act when needed.  I’ve genuinely just never felt more capable and dangerous.

**PROGRAM REVIEW**

*THE PROGRAMS IN GENERAL*

* I’m drawn to Jamie’s programming primarily because he doesn’t rely much on percentages and he encourages experimentation.  His programming is far more ideas and structures than an actual set routine, and the focus is on effort.  What was even more awesome about both Feast and Famine was that Jamie offers a 3-4 day variant and a 5-6 day variant of both programs, so there’s a LOT of flexibility there.  Those 3-4 day variants are LOADED to make it all work out, so, amazingly, I found myself drawn to the 5-6 day variants instead.  Since I get up early to train, I’m able to train 5 days a week without issue and didn’t need to cut down to 3-4 days, despite the fact I’ve written about the value of lifting weights 3-4 days a week to put on size.  It helps that, at this point in my training, putting on size wasn’t the concern: I had Super Squats for that.  For now, the goal was simply to experience the training and see what happened.

**AWESOME ELEMENTS OF FAMINE AND FEAST PROGRAMS**


* Both programs feature a day Jamie refers to as “Dealer’s Choice”, which is as it sounds: do what you want.  For Famine, it’s up to 90 minutes.  For Feast, there’s no set time and Jamie even permits you to make it a day off if needed (which, despite all the increased cals, you may still need: I’ll detail that more later).  Either way is brilliant, and I think EVERY program needs this.  Trainees are stupid.  I’m including myself in there.  Trainees will ALWAYS sneak stupid crap into a program.  Pet lifts (curls, of course), stupid human tricks and gimmicks, “weak areas”, etc.   Trainees will inevitably wreck a program because they’ll change it up too much to fit in all this extra stuff that they end up reducing the effectiveness or flat our violating the intent, turning accumulation into intensification or GPP.  By having ONE day of the program where you just do what you want, you can get it all out of your system and then get back on program.  It’s the “cheat meal” of training.  During Famine, I’d throw in ALL that extra stuff I was doing before: Poundstone curls, lateral raise deathsets, belt squats, Kroc Rows, mat pull ROM progression, etc.  During Feast, my schedule was nuttier, so I often would just continue the ROM progression cycle and, if I had time, throw in some conditioning work and call it good.  But in both cases: my program compliance was MUCH stronger compared to programs I’d run in the past.

* Daily physical requirements/daily work.  Prior to starting up the program, I had my own daily work, which was: 50 chins, 50 dips, 50 pull aparts, 40 reverse hypers, 30 GHRs, 20 standing ab wheels, and often some neck work.  I’d get this done no matter what.  Jamie prescribes a daily 2 mile walk, outside, no matter what, along with 300 squats and 300 push ups.  I balked when I first saw that…and, in turn, loved that I had a new challenge in front of me.  And yeah: the first 2 days, I was SORE AS HELL, but upon adapting, I saw some AMAZING results.  The push ups and squats have honestly been transformative, as I’m seeing veins all over my quads and shoulders, but honestly, that daily 2 mile walk outside has probably been one of the most positive things I’ve ever done for myself.  It’s a chance to clear my head, get in some vitamin D, and bring back some health into my life.  Having it be a daily requirement and forcing myself to come up with ways to fit the walk into my day has been awesome, and my dog is appreciating all the time outside as well, and it’s gotten me to break out my weight vest again to add in even more resistance opportunities.  And that 2 mile walk has become a mere minimum, as I find myself becoming “activity seeking”, and will often get in 2 miles unweighted walking and then an extra 1-2 miles with a weight vest on as well. 

* On the daily work, Jamie is adamant that “this is not part of your workout-it is part of being a human being”.  I appreciate the sentiment there.  Being able to move your body through space is huge.  That said, I was big on making the push ups and squats INTO a workout when possible.  Toward the end, my go to was to use Tabata intervals of 20 seconds on/10 seconds off and do squats during the 20 second and push ups during the 10.  I’d settle on 20 squats per round and 15 push ups, getting me 300 squats in 15 rounds, and then I’d do the remaining push ups as fast as possible.  Keeping to those Tabata intervals makes this a pretty solid conditioning hit and only takes about 9 minutes to knock out.  Typically, I’d do this after the workout on weekdays, and on weekends I took to accomplishing it literally as soon as my feet would hit the floor in the morning.  I HATE working out, still do, and getting this done ASAP was pretty big for me.  Sometimes, though, I’d get cute and start incorporating push ups and squats into a larger conditioning paradigm, like in a circuit with swings, or GHRs, or chins, etc.  But, either way, I always met these goals.

**DEVIATIONS I MADE TO BOTH PROGRAMS**

* Jamie encourages experimentation, so game on.

* Jamie slots that “Dealer’s choice” toward the middle of the week with both programs, but for my work schedule it worked better to put it on Fridays/Weekends.  In the case of Famine, his middle of the week workout is either a day off or a 30 minute bodyweight conditioning circuit, which fit MUCH better with my weekend schedule, so putting that on Sat/Sun and Dealer’s choice on Friday allowed me to get in a 60+ minute dealer’s choice workout, which got in a lot of work.  In the case of Feast, there are 5 loaded days of training that worked much better for M-F for me, and then dealer’s choice on weekends allowed me to get anywhere from a 4-60 minute workout, depending on what my choice was as the dealer.  

* I made sure to run a full week of both programs exactly as written out, to include rest times, exercise order, etc.  In doing so, many of my workouts ran into the 80+ minute mark, which became a bit cumbersome with my schedule, but I wanted to understand how the training “felt” before I mucked with it.  Once I had that baseline established, I broke out the giant sets, short rest times, etc: all those tricks I’ve used in the past to get in more volume in less time.  I still made sure to bring the intensity, but wherever I could find logical pairings and groupings, I’d throw them in.  The 5xAMRAP hanging leg raises that happen EVERY training day are a quick kill, and much of the arm work could work in with other stuff.  Sometimes, though, it’d become something incredibly brutal, like bouncing between heavy shrugs and squats during Feast (more on that later).

* You’ll note I did NOT write about additional conditioning work, extra workouts, etc etc.  Jamie really “fixed” my compulsion here.  I’d be done with the training…and I’d trained “enough”.  This was really pretty huge for me.

*”FAMINE” SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS/DEVIATIONS*

* With Jamie’s permission, I took full workout footage of all my training sessions of Famine AND Feast, so I’ll post those if you want to see the whole thing in action.

* [Feast: Playlist isn't fully updated, but the videos are all on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k8jkk6VLec&list=PLfcuGAffLlSf-y7VAbGZ3TVKoE1T5OycC&pp=iAQB)

* I made a few deviations from the programming, more out of equipment limitations.  I don’t have a leg extension or leg curl machine.  For extensions, I could use my reverse hyper, sit on top of it, hook my feet through the straps and do extensions.  That worked well.  Turning around to do curls that way?  Not as great.   I stuck with it through Famine, since it’s only 2 weeks, before eventually just going with GHRs during Feast, and when I return to Famine, that’s where I’ll go.

* My cable set up is pretty janky, so for cable rows I went with landmine t-bar rows instead.  I also don’t have a machine shoulder press, but I rigged up a VERY awesome Viking press set-up with bands that was clutch (you’ll see it on the video).

* Strongman implements regularly featured, because they’re awesome.  I also was making extensive use of the SSB, because I was still pretty broken from Super Squats.

* I didn’t follow the diet 100%, but I met the spirit of it.  LOTS of caffeine, shakes made up the majority of my nutrition, calories were low.  I trained fasted as well.  

*”FEAST” SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS/DEVIATIONS*

* I underwent a MAJOR nutritional pivot during Feast, and it’s been one of the most positive things I’ve done for myself in a long time.  I absolutely didn’t meet Jamie’s prescription as far as calories goes, primarily because I’m not going to count calories.  In addition, the shakes were still regular features because they went a long way toward streamlining my life.  HOWEVER, for my solid meals: I went carnivore.  I’d been wanting to try out a carnivore diet for a few years now, after listening first to Shawn Baker and then Paul Saladino and a few other carnivore influencers talk to the approach (and constantly hearing Mark Bell beat the drum for it).  This also matches up a bit more directly with how Jamie laid out the “Apex Predator Diet”, as the solid meals were all meat.  I honestly just wasn’t in a good place psychologically to undertake it, but this protocol was VERY freeing in that regard, so I went full steam ahead…and it’s been amazing.  I’ll probably just have to make it another blog post (a continuation of the overhaul series), but I’m only eating meat, eggs and cheese/dairy, and I attribute that to some of the AMAZING results I’ve gotten (will sum that up at the end).  I still opt for high quality sources (grassfed beef/dairy when possible, pasture raise eggs, etc), and I’m still using supplements to fill in gaps (Superfood, Flameout, several others), but the Feast has been a carnivore Feast.  Conan approved!  

* After the first week of Anderson squats, I used a larger ROM and started using bands.  That was the right call.  My hip and knee were STILL messed up from Super Squats, and heavy loading was killing them.  The bands allowed me to keep the bar weight low, but the intensity was THROUGH THE ROOF.  Try breaking a dead weight off of chains when it’s banded in place.  It takes EFFORT!  And you can NOT quit once you start. 

* Rather than do 5x10-15 leg curls, I did GHRs.  But along with that, I did them with my push ups and squats, turning it into a circuit workout.  I worked up to a final workout of 15 rounds of 15 GHRs, 20 squats, 15 push ups, then got in the remaining 75 push ups to get my 300, then went for a max set of GHRs.  It was a LOT of GHRs. 

* For benching, week 1 was dead bench, week 2 was dead bench against bands, week 3 was touch and go axle bench, week 4 was pause axle bench with chains.  I ultimately just needed gimmicks to get me through it, but I was getting stronger.

* For pressing, I set out with a goal to get all 8 sets done in 8 minutes, using an EMOM style, so I never increased the weight on it.  Different ways to progress.

* For the squats and shrugs day, I rotated between SSB front squats and SSB squats, primarily because, with a deathset at the end, it was good to use the SSB.  SSB front squats are honestly a hidden gem of a movement that I rediscovered, and I’ll need to include it more in the future.  For the shrugs, I did my best to set it up like a hip and thigh lift, but on one set in particularly I REALLY crunched my left quad and had to eventually settle on trap bar shrugs for the final week.  And I think that’s going to be a more permanent solution.  It just works better.

* On that same day, instead of the leg curl work, I would do GHRs while holding a kettlebell in a goblet squat position.  Honestly: this is an AMAZING hamstring workout.  I made my final one particularly tough by doing sets of 3 every 20 seconds, getting in 9 sets total, then the 2 AMRAPS, then dying.

* For pulls, I did a whole bunch of crazy crap, but it always included the trap bar.  High handle one week, ox lift one week (torqued my knee and wanted to keep loading light on the knee), high handle again but with short rests, low handle.  I stuck with trap bar because my “Dealer’s Choice” was deadlift bar ROM pull progression (I started the cycle on Famine and continued it through Feast, which was like a billion IQ move on my part) and I didn’t need to pull heavy with a strap bar twice in a week.  This also made the rows awesome, as I went with trap bar rows, which are what I’ll bring into Famine.  They’re an awesome movement.

* I apologize if this seems gratitious, but I just cannot emphasize enough how freeing and ridiculous it is to be able to just eat and eat and eat and see nothing but results.  The protocol is self-perpetuating: as you see yourself transform, you just keep leaning into it.


**BACKGROUND**

*Ancient History Stuff*

* I am 37 years old, 5’9, 182.3lbs as of my writing this, have been lifting weights since I was 14, competed in powerlifting and strongman since 2010, have a background in martial arts/wrestling, have pulled 601, squatted 502 and benched 342 in a meet, lifted more in the gym, and done lots of nutty things in my time.

* More Relevant Background* 

* Prior to starting up Jamie’s diet and program, I had just finished up Super Squats, also a great program for different reasons.  This was an epic run of it, culminating in me squatting 405 for 20 reps and getting fairly jacked…and also just absolutely destroying my body in the process.  If you're curious about my experience contracting RSV and tearing my tricep in the first run and all the elbow/knee/hip pain I had in the second run, here are my two write ups

https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/znfw1m/program_review_super_squats_the_what_would_bruce/

https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/11go5su/program_review_super_squats_3_the_revenge/

* Clearly, a change was needed.

* I fell back to my old standby of reading “5/3/1 Forever” and ran the 5/3/1 Krypteia base phase, using front squats and SSB squats liberally as a means to heal my elbow, but there was more that needed doing.

**CHANGE 1: THE APEX PREDATOR DIET**

* Folks, this write up is HUGE, so I'm gonna cliff notes this part, but I intend to post the fully fleshed out review in my blog over the next few weeks, so if you DO want the nitty gritty, feel free to head over there.  A lot of this can be found in the ""complete overhaul"" write ups.

* I’d read about the Apex Predator Diet before, in Jamie’s “Issuance of Insanity”. Previously, I had written them both off due to the extensive use of protein shakes, but when I considered how much I was spending on solid foods at this point to support myself, I realized a shake based diet would honestly be pretty economical.    I abided by Jamie’s recommendation for lean trainees to have 2 lunch time solid meals a week, since I got to meet my wife on those days for lunch, and my weekends were more solid food based, since that was time I got to spend with my family and I wasn’t going to be drinking shakes while we were out having meals together.  I still needed that social healing.  But, effectively, any time I could have a shake instead of a meal, I went with a shake.

**OUTCOME OF CHANGE #1** 

* I’ve written about this in my blog already as part of my “complete overhaul” series, but to summarize: this change in and of itself was life-changing.  I got back SO much of my life and my time with my family by switching the majority of my meals to shakes.  The two biggest offenders were my breakfasts and my pre-bed meals, of which I’ve logged about before, but they were massive and time consuming.  Ultimately, I needed “permission” to stop eating like that, and having the recommendation of someone like Jamie went a long way.  And after jumping straight in, I found out that I could still train just as hard and be just as strong even without the insane morning and nightly rituals.  

* As this change only lasted the course of the Krypteia base phase and deload, it was only 4 weeks of living this way.  After Super Squats, I still had some fluff to lose, and 4 weeks of dieting really isn’t much in the grand scheme of things, so I was seeing SOME positive physique changes but nothing significant…and then I started following one of Jamie’s programs and things REALLY got interesting.

**CHANGE 2: “FEAST, FAMINE AND FEROCITY”**

* It was practically kismet when Jamie released the Feast, Famine and Ferocity e-book, itself a re-packaging and update of an article series he’s previously released on his website.  I’ll do a review of the book package itself sometime in the future, but a quick summary is it’s a 50 page e-book where half of it is dedicated to the aforementioned program series of “Famine” and “Feast” while the other half is a republishing of his Bruce Randall article.  The later article IS a fantastic read, and I’d read it many times beforehand, but it’s worth appreciating that it’s really more a 30 page e-book in this regard.  That said, much like I wrote about in my review of Ben Pollack’s “Think Big”, a short e-book where every page is gold is SO much more valuable than 300 pages of fluff, and Jamie’s book definitely achieves that standard.

* I genuinely had no intention of changing programs when I bought the book: I just am such a fan of Jamie that when he sells stuff I buy it so I can give him support.  However, upon reading it, I new my fate was sealed, similarly to the first time I read “Super Squats” and was all keyed up to begin my 6 weeks on that program once the book was done.  The primary draw was the fact that the “Famine” diet was VERY similar to the Apex Predator modification I was currently following.  The primary difference is that Famine has NO solid meals whatsoever: all shakes.  I wasn’t about to do THAT, but I did permit myself a few “all shakes” days in the 2 weeks that I followed the program, primarily because my schedule would permit for that…which meant, specifically, my wife would be out of town and I wouldn’t be missing any meals with her.  If she’s around, I’m not going to skip a meal with her to have a shake.  Sorry: priorities.

* I’ll then go on to say that, when I finished the entire book, I thought “Yeah, Famine fits, but this diet has been going so well that I’m not gonna do ‘Feast’.  I’ll do Famine and then something else”.

* Yeah: that fell quickly to the wayside.  Jamie’s programming was so solid that I couldn’t wait to see it all the way through.  So with that, allow me to discuss both programs in a broad scale before going on to discuss each in detail.


----

**CONCLUSION**


* Folks, I could legit talk about this protocol any Jamie’s intervention into my life for a LONG time.  It’s honestly hard to cut myself off here (my current write up is 10 pages in length, but I’m trying to chop it down to make it readable for you).  Please ask questions, but, in general: this has become my favorite protocol in 23 years of training.  Everyone needs to run it.  Everyone needs to try Apex Predator.  Everyone needs to buy stuff from Jamie.  Call me a shill: I don’t care.  This has been life changing.",2023-05-15 15:33:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13iblr9/program_review_jamie_lewis_updated_feast_famine/
10flikh,weightroom,SBS Hypertrophy & RTF Program Review,"SBS Hypertrophy & RTF Review

My stats prior to beginning SBS Hypertrophy (14wks) then RTF (21wks) Programs

* 28 years old, 155lbs
* Squat: 510x1
* Bench: 360x1
* Deadlift: 565x1

---

I ran the Hypertrophy program in a bulk all 14 weeks. I compete in powerlifting at 148lbs and ended up getting up to 165lbs before deciding it was time to cut again while running RTF to get down to 150. 

* For both of these programs I ran the 5x weeks versions, training Sun/Mon/We’d/Thur/Fri and then Resting on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

* For the Hypertrophy version, I did an over warm single for the main 4 movements almost every session. I ate in a caloric surplus of ~500cal and really tried to add size all over, even though I’ve been training for a decade. 

* For the RTF version, I also did the over warm singles on the main 4 movements, and ate in a ~600-700 calorie deficit.

* Supplements: Creatine, fish oil, and vitamin D


**Results**

* Hypertrophy - Gained 10lbs in 14wks putting 1” on my neck, 1” on each arm, 1” on my thighs, 1” on my chest, 1/2” on my shoulders, and 1/4” on my calves and forearms (I even trained calves 3x/wk). I also hit [405lbs on back squat for 12 reps](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CXPADk6AP9l/?igshid=YWJhMjlhZTc=), then [a 20 rep max on SQ (335lbs)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZzxhTAO1Q5/?igshid=YWJhMjlhZTc=) and [on deadlift (445lbs)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CZNGK99Brns/?igshid=YWJhMjlhZTc=)on one of my last AMRAP sets, AND I hit a PR on OHP by +15lbs because I was feeling so good/confident due to all the over warm singles.
* Pros: Build kick ass work capacity when you have 6-8 exercises each day and need to get it done in under 75min, Feel like a bodybuilder and have a better MMC since the weights are lighter[and feeling kinda jacked](https://imgur.com/a/it0qerU), and it gives my joints a break from all the heavy ass training I usually do.
* Cons: Not accustomed to the heavier percentages so when going back to strength focus it takes awhile to adjust, You can feel pretty beat up after each workout and exhausted but totally worth it

* RTF - Lost roughly 15lbs through the program, and increased my deadlift by 40lbs. I used week 21 as a deload and tested all three lifts at the end of the week. Squat stayed the same, because I hit 500 and felt okay so I jumped to 515lbs but failed the lift. My E1RM for squat was 520. Bench Press went down (as usual during my cuts), because I get 340 during testing and jumped to 350 but got stapled even though my E1RM was 366lbs. Deadlift…this was the best thing about the whole program. I was on week 19 and was working up to a single and only got to 515lbs, which was well below what I was supposed to do for the day so I called it quits for DL and did all my other exercises. I thought about it all day at work and so after work I decided to go at it again, hitting 545lbs for 5 reps, then I said “F* It, I’m going for a PR” and pulled 605lbs. It’s been a dream of mine for YEARS to pull over 600 and [I DID THE DAMN THING!!](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdtVsDOOb-j/?igshid=YWJhMjlhZTc=) 
* Pros: Low reps and heavier weight to practice my sport and master technique, Not super fatiguing compared to the Hypertrophy version, Didn’t feel as beat up physically and mentally either
* Cons: CAN be fatiguing if doing lots of accessories on top of over warm singles and working sets, especially in a deficit. Plus the programs can be super boring and monotonous (that goes for all of the programs)


**Thoughts:**

* I enjoyed this program. While I know my Squat and Bench took hits during my cut, I still got a lot out of the program and definitely plan to run it again. I would probably drop OHP and make it another Bench day, add a set to all my bench and bench auxiliaries, and just cut slower next time if I do it in a deficit.
* I absolutely LOVED hitting back in some form every single day I was in the gym. You can never pull too much
*5x a week full body is perfect for me running this program. I like the higher frequency because it means more time to master my craft in a less fatigued state. 
* 9/10 and would recommend others give it a shot. The program is $10 and you have SO many options to choose from, including endless possibilities with the Program Builder spreadsheet. You’d be doing yourself a disservice if you didn’t get this program.

--- 

**tl;dr: u/gnuckols is a genius and needs to be protected at all costs. Even after 10 years of lifting I enjoyed the program and made gains on it. 9/10 and would recommend.


[Here’s my review in video format if you care to check it out.](https://youtu.be/AQdZVIH8NJs)",2023-01-18 23:13:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/10flikh/sbs_hypertrophy_rtf_program_review/
yecla1,weightroom,[Program Review] SBS RTF with multiple life upheavals,"**TLDR:** Put 40lbs on my total despite many things happening, very unlucky circumstances on the days I tested my maxes, and a terrible diet. Learned a lot about pushing myself, improved a lot as a lifter. \[radio announcer voice\] For $10, the world can be your oyster with the SBS program bundle. The most customizable program I've seen if you're someone who likes to really be able to adjust things to your liking.

**Background**

21F. Never consistently did anything athletic in my life until I joined rugby freshman year of college. I worked out along with YouTube videos & light dumbbells during COVID (sophomore year), worked with a personal trainer for summer 2021, started doing my own thing that fall when I went back to school. Severe fuckarounditis; finally started running a program I found on Liftvault called Brogains Powerbuilding that winter but quit in search of another program after 6ish weeks because I didn't like it for several reasons. Purchased bundle of SBS programs in March 2022 and started running SBS Hypertrophy in April, but switched to RTF after a few weeks because powerlifting and because very high rep deadlift sets aren't it for me.

A bit of supplementary info: I was born with a condition called fibular hemimelia. Long story short, my right knee is missing an ACL and has an underdeveloped PCL; my right femur is longer than my left thanks to the process of eradicating my limb length discrepancy; I have limited mobility in my right ankle. Basically, squatting to depth is slightly harder, I don't go for long runs, and I can't get smooth ROM on calf raises. **I did not start consistently barbell squatting until January of this year** and was squatting to a box until March. Before this, I would box squat maybe once a week. **I repeat: I ONLY STARTED CONSISTENTLY SQUATTING IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR.**

**The program**

You're all presumably pretty familiar with it at this point. 21 weeks comprised of 3 6-week blocks which are each followed by a deload. Each block is generally heavier than the last and the final block prepares you to test 1RMs after the final deload. With the RTF version, you're given a number of reps for your working sets and a rep out target for your final set which is an AMRAP. Don't hit the target and your training max suffers; hit it exactly and it doesn't change; exceed it a little or a lot and it increases a little or slightly more. Option to lift anywhere between 2-6x/week.

I moved home and switched gyms around week 5. Took a week off for vacation around week 10. Midway through week 16 **I moved to a different country** for my semester abroad. I remade the spreadsheet in KG (easy to do, I just took my current TMs, converted them, put them in, and scrolled to the week I was at). About a week passed between when I left off in week 16 and when I got settled in at a new gym. I took about 9 days toward the end of/after week 20 because I had a lot going on. Between these breaks and other things it took me a bit less than 6 months to run this program.

**Diet/conditioning/recovery**

I'm an extremely picky eater and rely largely on protein shakes and chicken. I pretty much eat like your average 12-year-old if the 12-year-old drank protein shakes. I was eating 2200-2600 calories, 120g of protein, and sitting at a BW of about 125lbs (I'm 5'5"") before moving abroad. I lost 5lbs very quickly after the move and have been barely maintaining a BW of 120 since. I do think this hurt my results/strength and I obviously do not recommend my diet. Currently hitting around 2000-2200 cals and 95-110g of protein. No supplements aside from protein shakes/bars.

I played rugby twice a week until week 5, then joined a local team and played twice a week from about week 12-16. I didn't join a rugby team after moving abroad and have just been getting 10-15k steps a day with no other cardio *\[hits myself with a rolled up newspaper\].* I manage insomnia with medication and get about 7-10 hours of sleep. I didn't consistently rest after day 6 and frequently didn't take a rest day at all. Instead I rested on whichever day was most convenient or whenever I felt I needed a day off.

**How I ran the program (boring)**

I set it up for 6x/week and stuck with that except for a couple weeks of running a 5x/week version so running it wouldn't take longer when I had rugby practice twice a week. The program is meant to be run as full body but is highly customizable. I prefer to squat and bench on the same day rather than squat and deadlift or bench and deadlift, so that's how I set it up and opted for a quads/pull/glutes/push/full legs/full upper split (not actually a thing, I made it up) rather than full body. I'm a beginner so this was just what worked for me, please put more faith in Greg Nuckols' advice than in my personal preferences.

My four main lifts were high bar squat, bench, conventional DL, sumo DL. I didn't have a preference between deadlift stances at the time, had similar numbers on both, wanted to save my deadlift auxiliary for RDL, and wasn't really interested in BB OHP. Auxiliary lifts included slow eccentric squat due to a tendency to divebomb, blah blah. DB OHP was my OHP aux and the only OHPing I did during the program.

I kept the number of sets on my main lifts at 5 but took it down to 4 for my auxiliaries. I usually included both one warmup set and the final AMRAP set in the number of sets I did. This was mostly due to time constraints, partly because tempo squat and bench are fatiguing, and partly because I'm a cheater and a bitch (I say this lightheartedly). You prob shouldn't do that. I set up accessories so that I wasn't doing more than 5 total exercises on any given day except on day 6, where I supersetted shrugs and lateral raises.

**Max testing and results**

Headed into week 20 feeling good. Thanks to the way the final block is structured, I had just hit a bench PR, a sumo DL PR, and matched previous squat and conventional DL PRs with relative ease. As I mentioned, I had to take over a week off because my friend was visiting and then I got a new tattoo, so I considered that to be my deload and skipped the programmed deload in favor of taking 3 days for S/B/D respectively and working up to RPE 8 singles with a couple accessories. I planned to follow the same S/B/D structure and test maxes over 3 days.

I take beta blockers to prevent migraines. To my great dismay, I was forced to quit the medication cold turkey two days before I was meant to max out due to circumstances beyond my control (obviously DO NOT DO THIS!). Arrived at the gym on **squat max day** and I physically could not stop trembling and my heart rate was like 140 when resting between warmups, in addition to my preexisting anxiety regarding heavy squats. I had hit 65kg during the final block. [Made 67.5kg despite shakiness](https://imgur.com/a/ouWQHMm). Went for 70kg even though my entire body was shaking; divebombed and failed. When I say I couldn't stop shaking, I mean I genuinely couldn't keep my body still and couldn't seem to calm down enough to brace effectively. Rested 5min and went for it again; failed. 

Next day was **bench day**. Hadn't slept well, super shaky again, sweaty and the bench was slippery. [I had hit 47.5kg](https://imgur.com/a/eCG31U2) during the final block. Warmed up and went for 50kg; failed right off the chest. Rested and tried again; failed right off the chest. I matched my previous PR and did some reps at a light weight to remind myself I'm not totally useless.

**Deadlift day.** I was comfortable with 97.5kg and less nervous for this day. I knew I had 100kg in me. Warmed up and went for 100kg; success but slightly soft knees. Tried for 102.5kg; failed at the very top due to grip slipping (bought some liquid chalk today, will be using it going forward). [Went for 100kg again](https://imgur.com/a/1U0rJqk), better lockout and it felt easier than the first time.

I didn't max out on auxiliaries but notably put 15lbs on my sumo deadlift; my RPE 8 paused squat single (and my RPE 8 regular squat single) increased 23lbs; RPE 8 bench single went up about 16lbs. For whatever it's worth, I also went up a size in pants because I added about 2 inches to my hip circumference.

**Actually results for real this time**

||Start/last tested maxes|End/results of max test|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bodyweight|122lbs, max 126|120lbs|
|Squat|61.2kg/135lbs|67.5kg/148.8lbs|
|Bench|43kg/95lbs|47.5kg/104.7lbs|
|Conventional DL|95kg/210lbs|100kg/220.5lbs|

**Thoughts on results**

* The numbers themselves seem like not much progress, but I'm personally really satisfied especially considering the stuff that's been going on in my life throughout the program.
   * Take a look at HOW some of my lifts were looking between the beginning and end of the program. [A couple pause squats from end of April](https://imgur.com/a/MUkFdPX); [a pause squat from several weeks ago](https://imgur.com/a/9rLmMUS). (Still not totally motionless at the bottom, silly me)
   * [A bench single in mid-May](https://imgur.com/a/Ez3aoEP); [a double from last month](https://imgur.com/a/RD8K7t7).
   * I'm still not a very good squatter, but I'm infinitely more confident and have better form than when I started. Squatting 3x a week was intimidating but I'm happy I did it.
* Max testing stresses me out and the medication thing severely affected me. Don't want to make excuses for myself but I think I would have had the 70kg squat and 50kg bench on a better day and the 102.5kg deadlift with a grip aid. This is also why I really appreciate the program structure wherein you necessarily hit PRs throughout.
* Somewhere in there I started hating pulling sumo.
* I do think slow eccentric squats were helpful, but they're necessarily more fatiguing and time-consuming than even paused squats. I dreaded doing them so much that I'd take an extra rest day just to put them off. I won't be implementing them in the next program I run.
* Re: my physique: pictures of me flexing are by no means indicative of progress and don't prove anything considering I'm flexing, but [here's a couple ""before pics""](https://imgur.com/a/fVh4uZl) and [a couple ""after pics""](https://imgur.com/a/qjeUwNr). When I don't flex my upper body looks like I've never met a burger, much less been inside a gym.

**Tentative recommendations/what's next**

* The program is smart but it is also dumb. It doesn't know whether you got 0 reps on your AMRAP set because you got 0 reps or because you wore the world's slipperiest shirt and couldn't get stable enough to perform a squat properly. The latter happened to me at one point, I input it as 0 reps, and it severely knocked down my training max. If there's an actual extenuating circumstance you can fudge your results a little. 
   * Common sense: obviously don't get into the habit of telling yourself ""I just feel kinda shitty today, I definitely would've gotten 5 more reps on that AMRAP set normally! I'm just gonna put it in as 5 more reps!""
   * Your TM takes a huge hit if you're significantly under the rep target. You may want to slightly adjust the percentage it decreases when that happens instead of or maybe in addition to keeping in mind that you can fudge the numbers a bit if something unusual happens.
   * You can do more reps than you think. I consistently did much better than I was expecting on the AMRAP squat sets by doing a few reps, breathing, doing a couple more, breathing more, and not giving myself the option to give up early. If you're not willing to push yourself, you won't get much out of this program.
* For my training maxes, I put in weights I could hit for a difficult triple and that worked out great. Conservative training maxes are a good idea, but also don't stress about it too much as your TMs will adjust up or down based on your performance.
* I'll be running SBS Program Builder with RTF for main lifts and for all auxiliaries except RDLs (hypertrophy progression) and with several of the accessory progression schemes for accessories. Taking it down to 5x a week but I may end up changing back to 6x. 
   * I'm switching up my bench auxiliaries and implementing low bar squats - I have long femurs and have always wanted to low bar squat, but I've only tried once. 
   * Since I'm doing 5 days it'll be more full body, but still primarily focused on upper or lower. 
   * I now hate pulling sumo but am keeping it as an auxiliary.
   * Still doing 5 sets (ok, 5 *total* sets) for my mains (now SBDOHP) and 4 sets for my auxiliaries. Keeping number of exercises per day to 5 max except on the day when I do a main lift and multiple auxiliaries (bench, low bar squat, RDL) which I'm only adding calf raises to.
   * I would just run RTF again but I wanted to use the hypertrophy progression for RDLs, have a different quantity of auxiliary lifts, and implement a concrete progression for accessories.
   * I plan to eventually compete in powerlifting but probably not until next summer or the following year, depending on whether I decide I'd rather give a comp a try first or whether I'd rather achieve even slightly competitive numbers first.
* At one point toward the beginning of running this program, I asked in my college's powerlifting team group chat whether anyone had heard of SBS programs and explained the progression based on the AMRAP set. Everyone who replied was like ""if you take compounds to failure you will hurt yourself and never make progress and kill your gains and break your legs and die before you turn 30 and that program sounds like a terrible idea why don't you just let us and our collective zero coaching experience write you a program?"" Oh yeah? Well fuck you powerlifting team, I don't need you.",2022-10-26 23:42:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/yecla1/program_review_sbs_rtf_with_multiple_life/
xw7q3l,weightroom,"[Meet Report] IATBP Powerlifting Meet - Atlanta, GA, USA (494.3 kg @ 102.6 kg | 300.77 Wilks*, F/34)","Had the time of my life at my first powerlifting meet after losing 40 pounds and putting 75 on my total in my 9 month meet prep!

Without further ado, 

**Background and Training**

I am a trans woman on HRT for 22 months. 5’11”, 226 pounds. Supplements: 1400 mg fish oil, 5g creatine, 2 a day multi-vitamin.

I was active throughout high school in recreational sports, and would mess around in the YMCA weight room with workouts from muscle mags. In college I joined the crew team, and was a mediocre rower and followed some off season linear periodization with awful form. This however messed up my eating a bit as I was eating close 4,000 calories a day, so when I had a nerve injury that took me off the water, I had problems re-adjusting. After college I had some struggles with alcohol and didn't train for nearly a decade, I would occasionally head into the gym and do some pump work or string together a few months of 30-minute circuits and elliptical at Planet Fitness.

I started training seriously in 2019 , working with a personal trainer and dropping nearly 50 pounds. I started with 3 months of linear progression, then I ran 531 style programming for a few months and then COVID hit. Not meeting with a trainer, I started cutting a little too aggressively and my training suffered. By fall 2020, I eventually got back in the weight room and ran the SBS RIR template and relocated to Pennsylvania. I had a temporary job working in a warehouse doing manual labor and again my training suffered. I would struggle with recovery and would crush my rep targets one week and then couldn't break the bar off the floor the next. I moved to conjugate style programming because a lot of people at my gym were running it which let me auto-regulate a little better, or at the very least got me out of my head. By the end of summer 2021, I realized that my squat and bench were being held back by poor form exacerbated by a lack of specificity so I have been doing more squatting and upped my bench frequency. I generally run any kind of accessory as a ""beat the book"" double progression in 8-12 or 15-20 rep ranges but find that I am always bloating out any template I am running with too many movements. Heading into January/Meet Prep, my highest tested maxes were 385 Squat , 225 Bench, and 405 Deadlift at 265 pounds. Which means I put 75+ pounds on my total and dropped 40 pounds of bodyweight! Not too shabby.

**Meet Prep**

For this meet prep (January to October) I worked with Aaron Thomas from Stronger by Science coaching. We utilized a 5 day high frequency block periodized approach with 5 week mesos. There were heavy top sets once per week and all lifts were programmed with RIR targets. In the lead up to the meet I hit heavy single top sets for 4 weeks with 1 rep in reserve, tapered for one week, and then a pretty typical “peak week” to drop fatigue : <75% with three SBD days of 3 singles each.

Over the course of the 9 months of training, I moved from 265 to \~226 before a maintenance phase which brought me back up to 232. I did not cut weight immediately before the meet, but did fly, so subsisted primarily on tuna and minute rice. The morning of the meet I had steak and eggs at Waffle House and rice and chicken I got from a Mexican place.

**The Lifts**

I went 8/9 for a 1090 pound total. I left some pounds on the platform and was generally disappointed in my bench, as it has been stagnant or regressing for some time. I think this might be a function of HRT and changing body size as it is certainly not one of effort or intent. \*Disclaimer: The Wilks score in title is averaged from the male and female numbers as this is what the federation does!

**Squat**

 380 LB, [Make](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=682): This was easier than I expected, huge confidence boost. There’s something crazy that happens at a powerlifting meet where you just find this extra gear that you don’t know you had.

400 LB [Make](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=1225), Make: The meet was at a crossfit box with these big bumpers which throw you around like you’re riding a mechanical bull. This ironically cued me to brace even harder and this was the best 400 has felt. 

410 LB, [Make](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=1761): These numbers are entering the territory where my brain kind of checks out, I don’t remember thinking much during this one, it looks like it moves well, depth is a little bit more shallow than 400 and what I’ve done in the past. I walked away from this one thinking that I had more in me.

**Bench** 

210 LB, [Make](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=2410): Easy peasy, wasn’t worried about this one 

225 LB, [Make](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=2898): Barely? Looking at it I’m not sure that I would give myself this rep. This is an emerging pattern on my bench, with the reps stopping half way up, I need to figure out what’s causing this. 

230 LB, [Miss](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=3449): I didn’t believe I had this in me and probably manifested. This is a weight I have hit in training, but it was just not there today.

**Deadlift** 

405 LB, [Make](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=3840): This is a warmup weight for me but I almost passed out. I was over eager and messed up my brace. 

425 LB, [Make](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=4376): Return to form, held my valsalva for longer afterwards and managed to avoid any light headedness. In retrospect I should have pushed this attempt to put 465 “mentally” in reach, but I was gunshy from a concussion I sustained after a deadlift in the beginning of September. 

455 LB, [Make](https://youtu.be/wHXBhkum6Ig?t=4815): This was a PR. I had pulled 455 on a Kabuki PR bar, but never on a power bar.  If I could go back in time and attempt 465 for a 1100 pound total, I would, as I think it was there.

**Results**

 I took best lifter in my class (Femme II, AMAB >12 Mo. HRT) with the highest wilks and total overall. This was a PR total, even from cobbled together gym lifts, with my highest ever squat and deadlift Final thoughts I learned that powerlifting meets are not that scary. Timing your warmups was not nearly as hard as I thought, though it was a small field. I overprepared on snacks, hydration, packed and repacked my bag per Dan John’s advice, and had the time of my life.  I waited too long to pop my caffeine pills, panicked and took an extra half. I was out of my skull for several hours.

From a more lifting focused standpoint, I learned that my squat is not going to affect my deadlift that much. I learned that I need more time with heavy bench singles in the lead up to the meet, and need to include more pause work on my bench.

I met so many amazing people at the meet and we are talking about having a mock meet to participate in the Garage Gym Competition in May. One of the competitors is talking about organizing an IATBP meet in Sacramento next year, which I would want to volunteer at, and hit the Atlanta meet in October, and maybe a USPA meet in December. As far as future training, I ran myself into the ground and am just going to “bro” out in the gym and try to get a few more pounds off before the holidays. In the short few days before, and after the meet, I have seen my fasting blood glucose come down 10 points, RHR drop 7 points, and  I’ve dropped 10 pounds of weight in just water and inflammation. I am going to keep this health train rolling for a few more weeks before ramping back into training in December. My training will definitely be more GPP focused and I want to try to put on some muscle on my upper body and try to really fill out the 98 kilo class. If you are Trans, NB or GNC and want to powerlift, but don’t feel like there is a space for you, this organization is amazing and I hope it only continues to grow!",2022-10-05 11:11:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/xw7q3l/meet_report_iatbp_powerlifting_meet_atlanta_ga/
w853m9,weightroom,[Coaching Review] Stronger by Science,"**High Level Info:**

I just completed 2 years of coaching from Stronger by Science.  When I first signed up for their services I couldn’t really find any review or information out there about how their service worked and if it was any good, so I figured I’d share my experiences here for you folks.  This is all the information I wish I had when I was considering their coaching program.

**Signing Up**:  The signup process consisted of filling out a really detailed questionnaire with exactly what you expect:  Goals, lifting history, injury history, sports history, how you like to train, etc.  That’s then reviewed by someone (which I assume is Eric or Greg) and then assigned to the lifting coach most suitable to your training style and goals.  There’s a ton of coaches on their roster, so I assume you’ll get someone good for you.  I was assigned Eric Trexler, who’s surprisingly way more helpful and far less sarcastic than you would expect from his SbS podcasting.  Some of this might be specific to him, but I’d imagine most of SbS coaching is in the same ballpark.

**Programming**:  The programs that I ran were tailored to me personally, put together by my coach.  We tried a few different styles of training at my request until we found something that really worked well for me.  At virtually any time I could say “Ok I’m really bored” and they’d happily put together a new program for me to keep things fresh.  Every Sunday the sheet was updated with the next week’s sets/reps/RIR targets for the program.  This was done through Google Sheets.

I never went ""off script"" to run any of the program parties here, but I always felt like I was free to say ""hey I'm going to do this for 6 weeks then let's get back to this program"".

**Communication**:  I was encouraged to email at any time, but coaching emails were only checked/responded to once per day.  I can’t think of any time I waited more than a day for a response, it was very fast and prompt.

Every 2 weeks I would fill in a questionnaire about my sleep, diet, training, etc where I would fill in how training was going and ask any questions I had.  About 1-2 days later an audio recording would be posted to a shared Google Drive folder talking about my two weeks of training and answering every question I had during that time.  The recording was usually 7-15 minutes, but I did get a 20, 30, and even 60 minute audio recording at some points really expanding on the questions I asked.  Your mileage may vary and some coaches may do written responses.  I think the audio was just for convenience...faster to talk than type.

At first I was hoping it would be a monthly call or something, but I actually REALLY came to appreciate the asynchronous nature of communication.  Any problem or question I had during the two weeks of training I’d jot down in a notebook and send off at the end of two weeks, and I’d get back a detailed, thoughtful answer for everything I asked.  It really gave space for me to think about exactly what to ask to use my time effectively, and it gave my coach space to think and expand on answers.

**Lifting Coaching - The Good**

I actually got a ton out of this coaching.  Here’s some highlights:

1.  Every question as simple or as complex that I’ve ever had about lifting was answered.  From how to build a program effectively, questions about running and cycling, timing workouts, etc.  Honestly this felt equal parts coaching and an *education* in lifting that was far beyond what I expected when I signed up.
2.  Form checks were really targeted to me and my lifting.  I have a bad shoulder, my knee occasionally acts up.  I posted a video to the drive and I got back a breakdown of things to improve, links to videos to study, and once or twice a video that my trainer recorded for me.
3.  A lot of advice was really tailored to ME personally.  I squat barefoot, and I knew that when asking about whether I should keep doing that or move to lifting shoes came from someone who has actually seen me squat and new my history/training.
4.  The programs I ran were tailored for me and really worked for me.  At my suggestion we tried out a few different program structures, days per week, rep ranges, etc, until we really dialed in exactly the style of program that I best responded to.  Once we had that template of what I was really responding to, we followed that template every time we shuffled the program to keep it fresh.
5.  I started coaching with my lifts stalled in every category, and coaching quickly unstuck them.  Any time I felt like progress was stalling my coach really went into problem solving mode and I never truly got stuck for long.
6.  Turning over program choices to someone else REALLY freed up a lot of brainspace, time, effort, and worry.  I know a lot of folks here live for lifting, but I’m really busy.  Putting someone else in charge of my training for two years was incredibly freeing.
7.  Communication was professional, to the point, and I really cannot believe Eric isn’t as sarcastic in all parts of life compared to his podcasting.


**Lifting Coaching - The Bad**

I had a really good experience with the lifting side of things overall and I’m really struggling to come up with something critical I didn’t like.  This is a review though, so here’s a couple of things:

1.  It’s expensive.  I personally think that it was worth every penny to unfuck my training (more on that in the comment below), and the amount of time I got from my trainer was NOT a small amount.  Still though, $2000 for a year or $2500 for lifting + diet coaching is a lot of money.
2.  I intentionally turned over all program decisions to my coach (though I’d still give feedback about what works and doesn’t), but I got really complacent over that time.  After about 20 weeks of a program the coach put together I’d start to get bored (but not realize it) and put in less effort.  There were a few stretches of time I really should have said “hey I’m bored let’s change things up” but didn’t, and training suffered as a result.  This is more of a me-problem though, as there was no way for a coach to know you are bored.
3.  If I really had to dig deep for a complaint, and a minor one, I’d say the 2 week checkin period was really, really good at catching problems over a 2 week window.  There were some problems that crept in over a longer window that we should have caught quicker.  An occasional stall in a lift over 2 weeks is normal, over 6 weeks was more up to me to catch and point out so we can work on it.  I don’t expect any coach with a roster of clients to remember all of my training from 2 months ago though, so again I don’t actually think this was a real issue with their coaching here.  It’s that I got so complacent (from handing over the program and progress to the coach) that I got lazy and that bit me.  After realizing this, it wasn’t a problem anymore.
4.  Communication:  Ok I was actually expecting some of the unprofessional tone, jokingly-weed-hating, and sarcastic Eric that I know from the podcast.  I got absolutely zero of that, it was all business, which was terribly disappointing.


**Lifting Coaching - Would I recommend it**:  If you need or want a coach (which I’d imagine is NOT the norm here) and you can afford it:  100%, absolutely.  It’s expensive, but it was worth absolutely every penny.  I’m making progress in every lift, I feel like I know enough to chart my own path from here, and I’ve learned an absolute ton outside of simply “buying a program, following program, and talking about program”.  I’m planning to go on my own from here, but if I ever get stuck again or stop making progress I’ll just sign back up, no question.

**Diet Coaching - The Good**

Since it was “only” $500 more to sign up for diet coaching, I did that too.  Here’s what I liked:

1.  Again, literally every question answered.  I have a really good grasp of supplements and every food-related question I wanted answered.
2.  They are very problem-solving focused.  The times in which I struggled with my diet it wasn’t a shame fest, it was “here’s some strategies, let’s give these a try, see if this works, and if not we’ll go back to the drawing board.”
3.  I’m TERRIBLE at finding what calories I should bulk or cut at, even with the old nsuns TDEE spreadsheet.  Turning over that decision making to someone who’s a neutral 3rd party fixed all of my bulking and cutting problems.

**Diet Coaching - The Bad**

Only the first complaint is really about SbS in particular, I think the rest of it is more my personal preferences clashed with diet coaching in general.

1.  The cost.  Even at $500/year I’m not sure I super needed diet coaching.  I don’t compete in any way, so this might have been overkill.
2.  (This is a me problem, nothing to do with SbS coaching quality.)  I simply don’t enjoy talking about my diet problems.  It actually stresses me out to talk about my diet failings, even though my coach was very neutral and supportive at all times.  I mean, I know why I didn’t hit my goals last week, I drank some extra whiskey and played some video games.
3.  My problems with finding the right calories has actually been solved by MacroFactor (also owned by SbS).  I stopped looking at the smart scale I have when I weigh in.  Now I just eat whatever MacroFactor tells me for my current goal.

**Diet Coaching - Would I recommend it?** - If you are competing for physique or having to cut down to make weight for powerlifting?  I think it’s probably worthwhile for folks.  The additive cost to add diet coaching isn’t so bad once you are already in such a high price ballpark.

For recreational lifters like me?  Probably not.  To be clear, I learned an absolute ton from the questions I asked, and had I put as much effort into diet coaching as I did lifting coaching then I would absolutely have gotten a lot out of it.  It just wasn’t for me though, and if you can consistently hit your macros, calories, and take your creatine, I’m not sure anyone really needs it if they aren’t competing.

**In short**:  Expensive, but WELL worth the price.  I highly recommend it.

---

So I know most reviews here have a bit about the trainee and such, but this has gotten way too long already.  I’m going to add a comment below about my background and how my coach fixed my stalled squat/bench/deadlift/ohp when we first started working together (it’s a pretty good illustration in how they solved different problems), but this really is all I have to say about SbS Personal Training.


I'm happy to answer any questions about the overall process.  I feel like I wrote a book in this thread, so I'll cut the post here.",2022-07-26 00:31:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/w853m9/coaching_review_stronger_by_science/

**Background**
I’ve been lifting for 4.5 years now. I’ve competed in 2 powerlifting comps. I’ve ran Reddit PPL, nSuns LP, many different 5/3/1 variants (the majority of my pre-SBS 2.0 training) and a few GZCL templates.

I hit 537.5 in the 93s - [195](https://imgur.com/a/GM4715c)/[122.5](https://imgur.com/a/vkDLClj)/[220](https://imgur.com/a/DPfIKrm) in April 2019 after my first year of serious lifting.

For my second meet in February 2020, I totaled 550 - [195](https://imgur.com/a/g5SVoXT)/[130](https://imgur.com/a/4yYcMBt)/[225](https://imgur.com/a/9sIB8NH) in the 83s. Not a bad result, considering I was almost 7kg lighter, and still took some PRs. Bit disappointed that I didn't squat over 200 on the platform again.

I started SBS 2.0 after the first lockdowns were lifted. I ran an LP to regain lost strength, did a couple months of a Frankenstein GZCL VDIP monstrosity that I “self-wrote” at took Max Rep Sets literally (this is how I failed VDIP /u/gzcl)

**The Program**

I think most people on this sub is pretty familiar with SBS 2.0

You can see my exercise selection in each section, but a general overview is that it’s run in three 6 week blocks with a deload in between each block so 21 weeks total. Depending on which variant you choose, the program differs. Reps to Failure (RTF) has you doing an AMRAP as the last set. Reps in Reserve (RIR) has you calling how many reps you have in the tank on your last set. The OG version has you doing sets until a target RIR. There’s a Hypertrophy version which is a higher volume version with AMRAPs (similar to RTF). All of these have “targets” you need to beat in order to progress your training max (TM). The program will give you weights to do based on this TM.

**Starting Point**

[85.7kg](https://imgur.com/a/35F6LYy)

I ran a 2 x 4 week Frankenstein program (based on GZCL VDIP principles) on a cut, thinking I’d do my own programming. Worst idea, but was actually the catalyst that pushed me to buy SBS 2.0. I was so run down doing constant max rep sets on heavy squats and deadlifts. Might have made some gains but fatigue was so high I have no idea if I did. Kinda worked on a cut though as I was still pushing myself. Fatigue was definitely not worth it. Fuck you Cody. Refund me my 8 weeks.

* Incline Bench

I did choose a TM close to my real maxes just to see how this first program went. Kept bench the same as my tested as I know from experience my TM is always inflated vs my real max.

As a dumb powerlifter I kept my [accessories simple](https://imgur.com/a/9ZpyCzO) and mostly was just doing pull work. In hindsight, I can do better here, especially with the tracking, and I currently do.

I ran this for 2 blocks and skipped the 3rd as it aligned with the end of my cut.

I didn’t really train OHP as hard as I should (dumb powerlifter) and I still don’t. Oh well. Sue me, prass enjoyers.

*Final Tested Maxes*

Lift | Weight
---------|----------
Squat | [210kg](https://imgur.com/a/kIJTPfI)
Bench | [140kg](https://imgur.com/a/gQjJqVc)
Deadlift | [250kg](https://imgur.com/a/AO52nyA)

I blame a misgroove for missing 220kg (jokes, I think the weight loss impacts my squat leverage the most). Looking back now my squat was high. I squat quite a bit deeper now. Bench was cool, hitting 3pl8 the first time on a cut. Deadlift was the best gains but could be due to sumo tech gains. I started sumo after my second comp in Feb 2020, so it’s likely I have a lot of gains to make on technique.

*Diet*

I was cutting very slowly. As you can see, over the 14 weeks I only lost around 3kg (end weight is higher as I did some maintenance over the holidays). I didn’t track that religiously - my method was to be strict and track Monday - Friday, then I would just cheat on the weekends (within reason). It’s what works for me on a long cut and I hate being restrictive. Being so slow is what I attribute to adding numbers to my bench and deadlift. I don’t have actual numbers for calories (deleted my TDEE nSuns app and redownloaded it). But I did get to a leanness I was happy with.

A strategy I also recommend is doing a maintenance refeed week in sync with deloads. Deloads are for recovering accumulative fatigue. I took advantage to psychologically recover from the diet by eating more comfort food (reasonably to maintenance levels) and also give my body fuel to recover. This helped the long cut.

*Thoughts*

Quite a standard set of Auxiliaries chosen. I could have definitely done better on accessories. But on a cut I chose to be quite minimal and just focused on SBD performance. As long as I did some pull work, I was pretty happy.

I did take a maintenance (didn’t track) period over the holiday period. The lightest weigh-in during this macrocycle was 18 Dec 2020 at 78.6kg. But I look better in the final pic, probably because I had more water and carbs filling me out a bit.

[Some other progress shots during this period.](https://imgur.com/a/SOuRuWe) Not diced to the socks, more like roughly chopped to the knee highs.

From there, I took 5 days off after my max tests and started on SBS 2.0 Hypertrophy.

**2nd Run - Hypertrophy**

23 February 2021 - 26 June 2021

*[Training Maxes](https://imgur.com/a/uzjTIt5)*

Lift | Start | End |
---------|----------|----------
Squat | 200 | 209
Bench | 135 | 151
Deadlift | 225 | 262
OHP | 75 | 78
Weight | [80.4kg](https://imgur.com/a/ibcQgkO) | [89kg](https://imgur.com/a/LfqGiIK)

Auxiliaries chosen:

* Safety Squat Bar squats (SSB)
* Hack Squat
* Close Grip Bench
* Feet Up Bench
* Romanian Deadlift
* Incline Bench

I took 10-15% off my lifts as per Greg’s advice doing the Hypertrophy template. I also switched to High Bar as my main squat - this was to have more quad focus and because HB is easier to do volume on that LB. My cardio sucks.

I still kept [accessories simple](https://imgur.com/a/u8WXZAe) but this time I did kind of like an ULULU split for accessories.

I ran this for 16 weeks. Couldn’t complete it as Sydney locked back down and I lost motivation despite having a rack and bench at that point. My excuse is I didn’t have enough plates to deadlift and I didn’t want to buy more. Whatever. Excuses.

I didn’t really train OHP as hard as I should (dumb powerlifter) and I still don’t. Oh well. Sue me, prass enjoyers. (This was a copy and paste statement)

I didn’t test my maxes here as I didn’t see the point. I also wasn’t doing overwarm singles.

*Diet*

I didn’t track calories during this period. I just reversed from my fatloss phase until I was gaining about 0.5kg per week.  Considering I gained 8.6kg over 16 weeks I was pretty successful. I ate very similar foods to my cut, I just added more stuff. More freedom with snacks. I add eggs. I ate more fruit. I ate more bread. I was still maintaining my 5 days clean, 2 days “dirty” diet. You still need to eat like an adult on a bulk. Plus, eating similar to a cut, just more, makes it easier to transition back to a cut later on. You just take out the stuff you added.

*Thoughts*

Work capacity was very rough at the start but I got used to it after a couple weeks. But it’s no joke. You will be on your knees, gasping for air after squat or deadlift AMRAPs if you’re actually going close to failure and pushing the rep targets.

Deadlifts shot up. Kinda cheating since I pull sumo now and bar ROM actually is a consideration when you’re pulling 15+ reps on the AMRAPs.

Squat I can attribute to doing High Bar - the initial TM might have been too high even with the reset. Even though I took 12% off my TM (only 5% off my tested max though) - my High Bar is estimated to only by ~85-90% of my Low Bar anyways. So the “small’ squat gains is actually due to setting too high of a TM.

**Lockdown Maintenance**

I basically ran some fahves just to maintain my strength. You can check my instagram for details but I’m not going to type it up because I just went by feel and rough %s (like 80-85% for 5s). I’d like to think I know what “hard” training is so I used that to keep myself accountable.

I also accidentally ate my way to [95kg](https://imgur.com/a/bpiLiU8). Woops. No regrets. Might have still gained some muscle.

We were locked down from around 30 June to 19 October - at least looking at my training videos. I took 2 weeks off right as the lockdown was poised to open as I started a new job recently, moved, and also just to relax.

**3rd Run - RIR pt. 2: Electric Grogaloo**

19 October 2021 - 23 December 2021

Very short period - wanted to join the /r/weightroom Program Party. So I only did 9 weeks on this block.

*[Training Maxes](https://imgur.com/a/rzTbz4n)*

Lift | Start | End |
---------|----------|----------
Squat | 230 | 239
Bench | 160 | 166
Deadlift | 250 | 273
OHP | 85 | 86
Weight | [91.2kg](https://imgur.com/a/tjytO0M) | [90kg](https://imgur.com/a/6rsYMfE)

I increased my squat TM in anticipation of switching back from HB to LB. I used a simple ~10% increase as that was what I thought the difference between the two lifts were for me. Bench during lockdown I actually tried because benching is easy to put effort into. So I took up my TM a bit as I hit a couple rep PRs and was comfortable using that as a predicted max. Also to note I only had weight up to 205kg during the lockdown. So I switched back to conventional deadlifts during this period. Obviously as I didn’t have enough weight and de-acclimated to heavy deadlifts, I thought it was a good idea to dock 5% off my training max.

Auxiliaries chosen:

* Safety Squat Bar squats (SSB)
* High Bar Squat
* Long Paush Bench
* Feet Up Bench
* Pause Deadlift
* Incline Bench

Not many remarks here for choices. I am still a basic bitch choosing simple things.

[Probably the laziest I was with accessories.](https://imgur.com/a/nvWvlAh)

I didn’t really train OHP as hard as I should (dumb powerlifter) and I still don’t. Oh well. Sue me, prass enjoyers. (This was another copy and paste statement)

I also reintroduced overwarm singles and managed to hit some PRs as overwarm singles.

[Deadlifted 250](https://imgur.com/a/1CDgvq5) (matched PR) but failed [260](https://imgur.com/a/FTgkWoy) (I pooped my pants on this one).

*Diet*

I did the same cut protocol as I did on my previous cut. Monday - Friday good boi. Saturday Sunday cheaty boi. Averaged out to about 2500kcal per day (weekly average) at the start and coming down to 2300kcal. I didn’t really cut good and my excuse is that it was the holiday season and I again didn’t track over this period

*Thoughts*

Was pretty cool to hit PRs as overwarm singles at 8-9. I didn’t test my maxes for nearly a year though, which can explain it, as well as the large bulk.

**4th Run - RTF**

01 January 2022 - 24 June 2022

/r/weightroom Program Party

I’m not a sandbagger. I like to do RIR because I can regulate better, make consistent progress better and prefer harder average sets than 1 AMRAP at the end. I also prefer the *option* of AMRAPs whenever I wanted to self-regulate.

RIR is a great program but sometimes you just need to do AMRAPs. Unless you’re testing your RPE scale, you could chronically under or over call your RPE - this can lead to burning out or never progressing. RTF works. Push yourself and you’ll make gains.

I also started a week earlier because in week 3 I needed to get 3 wisdom teeth removed. Taking a full week off meant I was in line with the party. It also made me lose 3kg because I had to drink my calories. As much as I tried, I lost weight. The week I started training again my top end strength was fine, but work capacity took a hard hit (had to reset on bench. I hate when I have to reset). So I changed tactics to maintain weight for the rest of block 1. That worked well and I managed to claw back my bench reset as well as make some TM gains here and there.

I took a very small reset on TM as coming off the last block I could feel myself hitting a bit of a wall on progression.

[Accessories.](https://imgur.com/a/9vOqXCg)

*Diet*

I continued my cut from 2021 for the first couple weeks, but wisdom teeth removal derailed that. As I said, I hate when I don’t at least meet rep targets and am forced to reset - having to do this on bench meant I changed my strategy to maintain from Week 3 - Week 7. This let me regain the reset, hit some RPE PRs for overwarm singles on Bench and continue pushing my TMs. Maintenance was found to be around 2550kcal.

I restarted my cut post deload in Week 8. Knew I had to do this write up now (promised to the /r/weightroom Program Party peeps) so I had to cut so I can do the proper lean comparison. So I decided to lose about 0.5kg per week which is within the Renaissance Periodization cut guidelines. So I restarted my cut at 2200kcal average daily - a 350kcal deficit to see how I would go.

I also signed up for a meet to compete in 83s so had to meet weight. I don’t like the idea of doing a water cut, I’d rather have the knowledge I’ll make weight.

*Thoughts*

Had the highest training maxes during this period. Also peaked out in terms of fatigue. Pretty noticeable as I had a persistent quad soreness and also managed to strain my adductor around 10 weeks out to my meet. Luckily I was a good boy with my rehab and worked with my physio to maintain loading, made basically a full recovery before the meet.

Then as my adductor made a full recovery, I herniated a disc 2 weeks out. Bummer. So no final test results unfortunately, you’ll just have to look at my final TMs and peak TMs.

Considering I lost around 8kg, I’m pretty happy with the TMs. It was mostly flat, so maintaining absolute strength whilst losing almost 10% of my body mass is pretty cool.

**Other stuff**

*Supplements*

Creatine. Whey. Fish Oil. Multi. I sometimes used preworkout.

*Sleep*

7-8 hrs per day. Didn’t compromise much on this. Went pretty well. Get enough sleep everyone.

*Standing Desk*

I got one. I stand most of the day now. It’s not good to be in one position for too long, so make sure you’re moving around throughout the day, especially if you have a desk job.

**Closing Thoughts**

*What works*

* Pushing hard. Most of my focus was on pushing my TM every week. I’m not usually one to sandbag and I liked to push myself. If my TM wasn’t going up, I would be disappointed in myself and endeavour to put more effort in to make it go up next time. Resetting was something I never wanted to do - I always pushed to crush the RIR or AMRAP target. If you check all the TM graphs - I always pushed to increase this. Bulk or cut. An AMRAP isn’t an AMRAP if you’re not pushing it. Sure, you might be scared of form breakdown and whatnot. But the more you grind at RPE 10, the better your technique is at grinding. Watch the video at the very end of the post.
* Reactive training. I took maintenance phases on my cut. I took reactionary deloads. As an intermediate, you have experience and knowledge of how and why programs work. As well as how your body is responding to the training. Take responsibility and understand that a cookie cutter program, even if it’s extremely well written, is not going to *always* work. You need to take the wheel and react to how you respond to the stimulus. Note: This is point 2 not 1 because you need to train sufficiently hard to get stimulus and feedback that warrants reaction. If you’re not pushing the TMs consistently, your training is too easy and there is no feedback.
* Do some AMRAPs. Even on the RIR type programs. I had a discussion on the A2S sub where another user said as long as you ballpark it it’s fine. It really isn’t. Be as accurate as you can - you’ll get better gains. If you’re bad at RIR, do RTF. Or do AMRAPs here and there to test yourself whether you can make the correct call. As an experiment I tried what happens if you miscall by 1 (beating the RIR target by 1 vs just hitting it). 8.85% increase in your TM over the course of the program. If you deadlift 200kg, this miscall could be 15kg on the TM that you’re missing on. It’s quite significant. And also, miscalls tend to not average out but skew in a direction. If you undercall your RIR once, you will tend to undercall as you *think* a rep is RPE 8 when it is *actually* RPE 7. Also, the closer you get to 0 RIR, usually the more accurate your call. It’s easy to tell when you have 0 or 1 rep left vs 5-6 reps left. This makes AMRAPs (even cutting it off at 1 RIR) really useful to build an RPE library.
* Do **more** not less. RTF really overfatigued me. My reaction to this was initially to switch to RIR for lower fatigue due to a meet coming up. HOWEVER. My immediate thoughts was *how do I recover more* not *how can I do less*. Conditioning was something I didn’t really consider up until this point but I have to thank /u/MythicalStrength and /u/Bethskw for writing some great posts that enlightened me. Now I can do more!
* Overwarm singles. If you check my lifts pre SBS they were kinda shit looking. Even though I was powerlifting for 2 years, nothing beats the accumulative experience and skill mastery of performing a heavy single every week. Plus it’s fun. Loading on a heavy ass weight and crushing it @ 8 feels good.
* Tracking accessories. This worked really well. I would just track them, and employ a double progression scheme - add reps until I hit the top end of the range I set for myself (12-15 reps usually) and then dropping it back to 8 reps with an increase in weight. Whenever I did track religiously - I feel like I made the most gains on them (nuh duh).
* Flexible dieting. I’m a huge advocate of eating what you want and cutting on as much calories as possible. Again, strength is the name of the game for me so cutting slowly and enjoying food was what made it possible.
* Refeed weeks at maintenance calories during deloads. This helps with a long cut psychologically and for recovery.
* Earn your deloads ([functional overreaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPZtjXYNkm0)). It’s a deload every 6 weeks. If you feel like you can keep going you didn’t try hard enough. By week 5 I felt like shit mentally. By week 6 my joints usually start complaining. [Here are some signs you did train hard enough for the deload to be worth it.](https://www.jtsstrength.com/fatigue-indicators-and-how-to-use-them/) For me personally, my mood, desire to train and sleep quality start to be affected in week 6 especially, with some signs in week 5. You can do AMRAPs on RIR in week 6, add volume to accessory lifts or do AMRAPs and/or drop sets at the end of each accessory. You can run high fatigue in week 6 - you’re getting a rest week for fucks sake. Earn it.
* Prehab work. Don’t skip warm ups and mobility work. I did hip mobility drills every squat session. I did rotator cuff and rear delt work every session to warm up for pressing. When I added core activation my bracing improved. Here’s my warm up routine if you were curious. Core/bracing drills: 90/90 breathing, dead bugs, bird dogs. Hip work: Internal rotation banded stretch, frog stretch, front and side leg swings. Rotator Cuff/Rear delt mobility: banded dislocations, pull aparts, external rotation, internal rotation. I used to have a hip impingement. COVID actually gave me the time to heal from it. With a combination of a narrower squat stance and hip mobility drills it never became an issue that affected performance once I recovered. Also I pressed 5x a week for maybe like 3.5 years. Always did the same warm up. Never had any shoulder issues.


*What didn’t work*

* Skipping OHP days. I hate prass. You may have figured that out by now.
* Not doing enough conditioning. I covered this in the doing more section.
* Not trying enough on dieting. If I showed more restraint on the bulk and cut a bit harder on the cuts, maybe I could have a better physique. But this can be a “what worked” as well. I never set hard timeframes for cutting or bulking. The goal was the goal - I did what I needed to get there but I wasn’t going to sacrifice my numbers as a result. Honestly, it’s just priorities - mine are just to get strong as fuck with a *relatively* lean body. Term used loosely here because I prefer being fat. 15% is lean enough for me.
* Not doing enough maintenance phases between bulking and cutting. I think my physique would be a lot better if I did. If you see me around the /r/fitness daily, you’ll see me post the [RP article](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/expert-advice/the-value-of-post-diet-maintenance) about this a lot. I don’t necessarily 100% agree you should spend equal time in maintenance as a cut though. It seems a bit overkill and just to delay your bulk. Maybe if you wanted to get lean and just stay lean with no real intention to pack on more size, this longer maintenance period might make more sense. But I’m going to try a 4 week maintenance into a lean bulk this time around.
* Powerlifting specific but not taking proper time to do volume blocks. My first proper long bulk and volume block on SBS Hypertrophy netted me a lot of gains. I wish that instead of chasing PRs on powerlifting strength programs all the time prior, I did more hypertrophy work and for a longer duration as well. I did run some volume blocks (like 5/3/1 BBB) here and there but never committed to a long bulk until 2021. Bulk for a year. Gain 10, 15, 20kg. Just get huge. Don’t be a diet lettuce boy.
* Not tracking accessory lifts. This is covered above as well. You want to progress even in the smallest way possible. Once I hit a wall on progression, I’d just reset the weight and reps and work back up, but usually add in something harder like a tempo or controlled negative. My worst “gains” was the 9 weeks of RIR where I wasn’t bothered doing accessories. Typical powerlifter.
* Not seeing the program out the whole way. Now some of this was my fault, some of it wasn’t. But if you can run at least the 14 weeks (skipping the last block as it’s kinda a peaking block) repeatedly, you’d probably get better results. My longest run was the hypertrophy macrocycle and despite the TM not moving *as* much on squat, I think I made the most gains on it. 21 weeks is a fairly long commitment though.

**Next Steps**

My next block of SBS is going to be an experiment. It’ll be my first time using the Program Builder - now that I’ve run RTF, RIR, Hypertrophy, I think I’m ready. I also have a cool name for it but that’s a secret until I’m done running it. Can’t give it a cool name if I don’t make sick gainz on it.. If you guys enjoyed this, I might do that as a shorter write up once it’s done.

This is a long one folks. You can get the book here: [https://www.amazon.com/Base-Strength-Program-Design-Blueprint-ebook/dp/B08R5J58F8](https://www.amazon.com/Base-Strength-Program-Design-Blueprint-ebook/dp/B08R5J58F8) for just 10 bucks.

**TLDR:**

I reset my training maxes, spent 12 weeks on volume and 12 weeks on building up to a 1rm.

BW: 105kg -> 110kg

Squat: 150kg(TM) ->200kg

Paused bench: 115kg ->130kg

Deadlift: 170kg -> 200kg

Strict press: 80kg -> 90kgx3

**Background**

Age: 26

Height: 6’5(195cm)

So I have been into martial arts basically my entire life. I have a background in striking arts such as karate, Muay Thai and boxing with my amateur career in kickboxing being about 20 full contact matches. In my late teens I started training MMA which I have been doing on and off for the past 7 years. When I was 19 I went into the Swedish military and served with a unit that spends most of its time either rucking/running/skiing for long distances(My best 10k run was 41:30). During those 5 years it was really hard for me to put on mass considering the daily aerobic work, long hours and fairly high workload. Ironically when we went on deployments I had the best development physically bulking from 90kg to 95 kg for my first deployment and then 95-100 for my second one.

Leaving the military I suddenly had a lot more time I could dedicate to strength training. The main two problems I had were the following:

&#x200B;

* I could not follow a program to save my life. I would always add more volume where it was not needed or go for 1rm’s on bad days just to try and force progression. As you all know, this can be a recipe for disaster.
* The service had absolutely fucked my lower back. I had pulled it twice pretty bad the years prior to getting out which caused me to have no confidence in my posterior chain whatsoever.

After program hopping for like a year and a half(wasted a whole bunch of time on 5/3/1) I ended up hitting platues with my all time maxes being:

Squat:175kg

Deadlift:180kg

Bench(touch and go): 125 kg

Press: 80kg

December 2021 I decided I just had to find a long term program to stick to since what I had been doing wasn’t really working for me. I was stagnating, my back and biceps tendonitis was flaring up and I was just feeling beat the fuck up no matter what I did.

My maxes going into my new training cycle was the following:

Squat:150kg(with my back feeling like it was going to snap in half)

Deadlift: 170kg

Bench: 120kg

Press: 80kg

**Why this program?**

So I had been following Alexander Bromley on Youtube for quite a while and I just liked his personality and presentation to be honest. I don’t know enough about strength training to judge the quality of his content but his long term approach to training appealed to me. I bought his e-book “Base Strength” and saw that he prescribed a volume/hypertrophy block before doing anything else. Seeing as I felt extremely beat up I liked the sound of some bodybuilding.

Now, this book provides you with several different options of progressions and splits. You piece these together yourself to make it work for you. I went with a standard 4 day throughout the whole program looking as the following:

Monday: Squat/DL Variation

Tuesday:Bench/Press variation

Thursday:DL/Squat variation

Friday:Press/Bench variation

**Goals:**

My primary goals were to build a solid base of strength I could continue to improve without running into injuries. The 1rm’s I wanted to hit were:

Squat: 185kg

Deadlift: 190 kg

Paused bench: 125kg

Press: 85kg

**Week 1-12: Volume**

For this training block I utilised the progression “Volumizing across” which basically means you during the course of 3 weeks increase the number of sets and weight dramatically before dropping weight and reps and moving down to the next number of reps. Obviously I won’t disclose every single detail but if you watch Bromley’s YouTube channel you know what to expect here. For example, the first cycle has you start at 3x12 and end up doing 5x12 at about 15% more weight. Then you move onto 3x10 and keep up the same pattern.

At this point I also started pausing my bench as I had read that it often helped with shoulder pain which I had experienced quite a lot of.

As for accessories I did everything I could get my hands on. Since the weights generally were so low I was dedicated to kill myself with volume. Looking at my training logs I averaged 30 sets per workout with the tonnage being about 20-30 tons of weight lifted per session.

Lower body accessories: High bar squats, hip thrusts, RDL’s, reverse nordic curls(The pump. Jesus.), leg extensions, leg curls, back extensions

Upper body accessories: Incline bench, Close grip bench, Chest press machine, Lat pulldowns, Hammer curls, Rope pushdowns, Dips, BTN-press.

**Results**

During this block my bodyweight went from about 105 kg to 110. At one point I weighed 114kg but that was after a huge meal and a shake.

I saw noticeable hypertrophy all over my body, but mainly in my pecs, shoulders and quads which absolutely blew up. Unfortunately I did not measure them but since running this block I have had to buy new pants as I ripped several.

**Week 13 - 24: Intensity**

Having built a tolerance to volume I switched focus to strength. For this block I used the progression “Intensifying across”. For this progression you start with a high number of working sets for week 1 and drop volume for three weeks, culminating in hitting a new max for the given rep range. So for example, 5x5 week 1, 3x5 week 2 and then you go all out for week 3 and find the heaviest 5 you can hit.

It was at this point when I hit my first max effort week where I understood how much the volume and break from heavy weights had helped. I hit 150kgx5 for my squat without feeling it in my back at all. This in turn made my confidence grow which across the weeks led to 160x4, 170x3 etc.

Lower body accessories: Paused squats, Paused DLs, RDLs, Hip thrusts

Upper body accessories: CG bench, Pin press, BTN-press, BB-row

I dropped most of my hypertrophy movements with the exceptions of some light arm work to keep the elbow healthy.

**Results:**

[Squat: 200kg](https://streamable.com/d41iku)

[Paused bench: 130kg](https://streamable.com/bwwp1n)

[Deadlift: 200kg](https://streamable.com/34sy6w)

[Press: 90kgx3](https://streamable.com/x7jjof)

So overall I just feel a lot stronger in my core and back with a ton of confidence going forward. I feel like I have built a maintainable strength base which I can build upon going forward. I feel like I have brought up my weaknesses quite a bit, especially my lower back. I am far from strong compared to most of you guys on this sub, but I am very happy with the results, both the ones on paper and how my lifts feel.

**Recovery/diet:**

During this training period I was going through a rough breakup which tanked my sleep and shot my stress levels through the roof. I tried to compensate by being consistent In my diet which was based around a protein intake of 200-220g/day and 4000 calories. It was nothing fancy. A litre of milk and 4 scoops of protein/day, lots of pasta with heavy cream based sauces. At least 300 grams of carbs a day.

For supplements I stuck to the usual stuff: 10g Creatine, multivitamins, omega 3’s.

**Mistakes:**

To be honest, I could have been way more dialed in with my diet. I could have eaten a lot more. I am shitty at eating breakfast which probably cost me 600 calories or so a day.

My discipline was tested greatly sometimes during this program. Towards the end of I had a hard time sticking to submaximal weights. I felt like I had so much more in me which made me adjust my training maxes upwards to challenge myself more. This worked fine for sessions where I felt great but made my expectations super high for next week. Going into the next session I might have a shitty day, which in turn made me dissappointed even tho I could hit my sets and reps, just not with the new TM.

Sometimes I had a hard time to pick my accessories for the different blocks. During the volume block it was easy since I was mainly chasing a pump, but going into more strength-specific training I did not really know which moves to pick. Eventually I decided to just pick variations of the main lift and try and progress those linearly and hope for the best.

**What’s next:**

Since I did barely any cardio at all for the past 6 months that is something I want rebuild. Now that my strength-numbers are approaching where I want them I'll run 12 weeks of base building out of Tactical Barbell to get back into conditioning. Hitting the main lifts three times a week is going to be a pretty major increase in both volume and frequency.

Anyways I have dragged on for way to long. I recommend everyone buy the book. Lots of good concepts explained in a great way. Especially for someone like me who doesn't know all that much about strength training yet.",2022-05-26 13:54:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/uy85fo/program_review_24_weeks_of_programming_out_of/

**BACKGROUND INFO**

As a kid I almost never did any physical activity, as I preferred videogames, TV and making things out of cardboard. I joined the gym in October 2017, spent almost a year going from 78kg or so to around 70kg. Second year I made my own programming and bulked, but wasn’t very successful with that

Next two years were spent doing almost nothing due to, in part, the pandemic, and in part, personal stuff. Joined the gym back again this last summer, and decided to follow this after regaining some strength

I look bigger than ever, I think. I don’t think that I’ve gained a ton of fat, but I also haven’t put on a ton of weight. Don’t trust too much the DL one, as it was the ugliest thing I’ve ever done, and looked more like an RDL than a DL

**THE PROGRAMS**

The first one was 5/3/1 BBB Beefcake. I found it to be a pretty good “wake up call”, as it made me realise I had to eat to survive this. I think it was pretty enjoyable, that I made pretty good gains, and that I will follow it again in the future

Building the Monolith is a lot more difficult than Beefcake. I think it is the program I was most concerned with the amount of food I was eating, to be able to survive the sheer amount of volume. I really liked how it was structured. The widowmakers (despite me fucking up the first few weeks’ percentages, lol) were manageable but hard, and the 200 dips/100 chins I think have made me stronger and bigger. Especially on my arms. Also, supersetting everything made me better conditioned

I was a bit scared of DW because of all the reviews, to be honest. DWBeg was, actually, pretty fun

It’s a simple program, tons of volume and you lower the rest times. On intermediate, you lower the amount of sets you do. Simple, but hard. Mentally more than physically. I found Intermediate a lot more boring than beginner, but it was still pretty good. Weeks 5 and 6 really test how much you are willing to push forward

I followed the programs pretty close to the original

On DWBeg instead of 4-3-2min rest, I did 3.5-2.5-1.5min; on DWInt I finished DL on 7 sets, squats on 6, power cleans on 6, OHP on 8, and push press on 6

**RECOVERY, SLEEP, DIET**

On DW if I have to be honest, I slacked a bit too much on the conditioning. On Beefcake and BtM I did some sort of conditioning or cardio at least 3 times a week, and I found myself feeling better, more relaxed, and with better recovery. I usually slept 6-8 hours a night

I tried to eat as much as I could. I eat whatever we are having in my house, plus some more, and some more. I think I would have gotten better results if I ate more protein and some more vegetables. I usually don’t take any supplements aside from the occasional whey protein

**LESSONS LEARNED**

Training hard is hard. Also makes you bigger and probably stronger. I haven’t tested my maxes yet, so I can’t be 100% sure

Following a program from someone who knows better what they’re doing than me is better than following my own

What I would have called RPE8 then, I would probably call it RPE6 now

**THINGS I WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENT**

I would have eaten more. And done more conditioning and cardio. And generally, try harder

If I follow this protocol again in the future, I will have a diet break in between 5/3/1 and DW. Maybe a mini cut, it gets boring and tiring

I don’t like power cleans. Or high pulls. Maybe I’d change them and see how it goes in the future

I would have done the jumps (and throws on 5/3/1). 0 recorded. Sorry about that

**WHAT IS NEXT?**

I am currently on a two week diet break. Somewhat like a maintenance phase. Then, I want to cut. I don’t really know for how long, or how low to go in BW, I will stop when I feel like it. After that, bulk, cut, etc. 

I want to focus for a bit of time on heavier loads, and see how strong have I gotten. Also, now that my chin ups have gotten to +15 I want to try and get the one arm chin up

Age: 36

Years lifting: 13

Height: 5’5”

Weight: 158 to 196.

1,000 no-rest days.

In this period I accomplished numerous goals. Including a [1RM Press of 235 lbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/). (+10 lbs. PR), a [315 lbs. 20-rep max squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/) (both at 175 lbs. bodyweight), gaining size ([about 20 lbs. of lean mass](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYfsa0hAOr-/)), and stamina (I can shovel snow literally forever). To celebrate the 1,000th day, I completed 33 rounds in a [60-minute AMRAP of a 1,000 lbs. total](https://youtu.be/_M-GCGod4RE) (345 squat, 243 bench, 412 deadlift).

**Introduction**

Hello! /u/GZCL ([Cody](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPhXX0CgmbJ/)) here. Creator of the [GZCL Method](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html) and many popular programs derived from it. A good intro to the method is linked in the [/r/Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).

For over 1,000 days I have worked out without rest days. That means no days out of the gym, and no counting steps as a workout, nor yoga, and not even shoveling snow… quickly becoming my [least favorite activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIwyZefLyL4).

All my workouts used resistance training in some way. Workouts were 99% barbell based and all but about 30 were above 10,000 feet elevation, where my gym is nestled. My training is structured by and progressed through my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework.

I accomplished these things by using a simple training framework, being consistent, and patience – the three foundational elements of progress.

**Goals**

· To see if I could.

· Assess potential for overtraining.

· Better regulate my training.

· Improve strength, size, stamina, and the condition of lingering injuries.

· To test and refine my General Gainz training framework and programs derived from it. (Read the above linked reddit post to get an idea of what that looks like.) All my personal training clients have also been lifting within this training framework.

One client has surpassed a year without a rest day. Read his fantastic write up:

[365 Days and Counting](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2021/).

**Results**

No missed workouts for 1000 consecutive days (closer to 1,050 now). Nearly all workouts consisted of lifting weights. Only one was bodyweight only (while on vacation, a fast paced, high volume, nauseating bodyweight circuit). Running, hiking, snow shoveling, etc., did not count as a workout, nor did yoga or other such activities. On many days in the winter because I live at over 10,000 feet elevation, I must shovel snow for hours. This I counted as survival, not training. Same for chopping and hauling wood in a sled. [Training is the means to survive easier.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIJuOsogabe/)

Because I was working out daily, I grew more aware of my recovery limits, thereby avoiding overtraining. This allowed me to better regulate my training as the days continued. Previously, when I was taking rest days, I counted time out of the gym as being a major aspect of recovery. That is a false notion. Because of that former belief I would go too hard in some workouts, figuring that “I would be out of the gym, and so recovering for the next session.” This was not always the case, as some workouts would go on for hours, often performing excessive amounts of sets and needlessly high intensities at all to frequent occurrences.

I had the mindset that a hard workout was always a beneficial workout and that a hard workout meant that I must be puking, shaking, or crawling out of the gym – I was wrong. A beneficial workout is one that produces a positive training stimulus while not increasing recovery debt so much that it inhibits the next workout. As I continued to train within my General Gainz framework I grew to understand this distinction and apply it consistently to my training. This improved the quality and consistency of my training. Compounding interest, but for gains.

I set personal records across rep ranges, from [1RM](https://www.instagram.com/p/B55q4pKggk3/) to 20RM, particularly for [press](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/) and [squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/). These are the two lifts that I have favored because they are less stressful on previously injured joints. Six weeks ago I hit a PR 203 lbs. [behind the neck press](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWmTgj5gZu9/) at random. It was just feeling good that day, so I went for it – an unusual decision for me lately – but old habits die hard. This lift improving shows me that my regular pressing is also, despite not currently being in an intensity directed training phase.

This was not my first bulk. But I do consider it my best. I gained 38 pounds between Day 31 and Day 1,000. Going from a low [of 158 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwItaivA_2-/) to a high of [196 pounds](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVjId0WA6KI/), with about 25 of those in 2021. I committed 2021 to a long bulk and a body building phase. The words are separated because I do not mean the sport, rather the goal of building muscle, particularly my arms and shoulders, as those were my goals.

Fat mass increased by about 5%, going from approximately 12% at 158 pounds bodyweight to 17% at 196 pounds bodyweight. This increased how much lean mass I am carrying by about 23.5 pounds (158\*.88=139, 196\*.83=162.6). ~~This means that in about 1,000 days I gained on average 1.4 pounds of muscle (and associated water weight) per month, or .35 pounds per week average. This is the biggest I have ever been.~~

~~(1000 days / 365 = 2.739 years \* 12 months = 32.868 months / 23 pounds = 1.42)~~ If my math is wrong here, let me know. I’m a pleb history major, not a king math wizard.

Math correction (I knew my math was wrong...): I gained 23 lbs of lean muscle of 32-ish months, hence about 0.7 lbs/month (or 1.4 months per lb). (Thank you [/u/itsgilles](https://www.reddit.com/u/itsgilles/) )

Additionally, I achieved the goal of rehabbing a hip and shoulder that would often cause pain while lifting and during daily living.  In 2017 and 2018, before these last 1,000 days, I could not even do a bodyweight squat, or bench, or deadlift one plate without pain. That is no longer the case, as I can now squat four plates and deadlift five without those prior issues. Not my best weights for those lifts but considering what they were rebuilt from – it is great progress for me.

This was accomplished without training either of those lifts with powerlifting-esq training intensities during 2021. Likewise, despite bench pressing maybe five times in 2021, I still managed an easy [293 pound paused single](https://www.instagram.com/p/CW3ZKIsLQ69/). This lift is the one that causes my shoulder the most grief, so I have not trained it much in the last two years (a mistake discussed in the following section).

Lastly, during this period I exclusively used General Gainz as the basis for every workout. Doing so improved the concept by expanding and refining the framework. Throughout these 1,000 days it became easier to plan, execute, and assess workouts. Since I began lifting in 2008, my training evolved from random everything to percentage-based powerlifting focused, to volume, intensity, effort relationship based, with a general strength and conditioning focus. In my early powerlifting years, from “[OG GZCL](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html)” to [Jacked & Tan 2.0](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html) to [UHF](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html) and later [VDIP](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/11/volume-dependent-intensity-progression.html). The last of which grew into what became General Gainz.

**Injuries**

This section is not a prescription or advice. It is meant to describe how I improved the conditions physically ailing *me*. Consult your physician regarding your specific problems.

Do not use reddit to diagnose and treat your injuries!

During the 1,000-day period I sustained no major injuries. Only aggravating a previous tear to the right trapezius and rhomboid, and a left groin strain. Both were caused by pushing too aggressively in a single session, causing old injuries (hip and shoulder) to flare up. When this happened, I trained those areas using light resistance and high rep exercises to improve the affected muscles. I would then focus on unaffected muscles and movements, training them with more weight and/or volume.

For example, when benching caused my shoulder to stiffen or ache, I began to do more overhead pressing, a movement that did not cause such problems. Likewise for deadlift, which affected my hip more than squatting – so I squatted more.

When a movement or muscle was giving me problems, I simply ‘worked it out’ in a very literal sense. In fact, years ago I bought a specialty leg press ([Shuttle Systems MVP](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIKA3q2ALIs/)) to help rebuild my hip strength after the joint sustained multiple injuries; the worse of which were not due to lifting, but by falling (I am clumsy and unathletic).

Through exercise I was able to improve the deteriorating condition of my two problem areas, left hip and right shoulder, thereby gradually improving the lifts that tax them most. Granted, I am not at my [peak powerlifting strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvePo-WSuzg), but I have not been training for powerlifting for years now.

Where I could have done better is the bench press. Between 2012 to 2016 I had strained my right pec numerous times. This coupled with a once dislocated shoulder resulted in a total dislike of the bench by 2017, for even 135 pounds caused serious discomfort. Disheartened (as I once enjoyed the lift) I abandoned it almost completely these last three years. That I should not have done. Instead, I should have committed to regularly benching very light weights, alongside the other kinds of pressing that I had redirected towards (predominately the strict press).

Apart from those things described above I sustained no other injuries. Symptoms of overtraining, considered by some a kind of injury, were only experienced after months-long bouts of doing the same lifts daily (squat and press, later deadlift and press). Those symptoms were slight (and perhaps more psychological than physical) and came on the heels of testing High Frequency Undulating Progression (HFUP); a training program detailed in a link below. After ending the HFUP training cycle, symptoms of overtraining disappeared within days. Therefore, I do not think I had overtrained, I was just carrying more fatigue than I was used to at that time.

**Training Organization**

Workouts were built using my General Gainz training framework the entire period. From that framework, various training plans were built, tested, and improved. Training ranged from periods of high frequency and specificity, where I would do the same lift daily for a month or more (HFUP). Such periods resulted in all-time personal records for press, behind the neck press, and pause squat (linked above). Throughout 2021 I largely stuck to a body building training plan to achieve the goal of gaining size, especially to my arms and shoulders.

I have not done the same program throughout these 1,000 days, but I have stuck to the General Gainz framework, using it to construct numerous progressions to achieve various training goals. Example Training Plans:

[Generally Strong](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2019/10/): A flexible upper/lower split. (Post includes details on applications and adaptations of General Gainz; ideas to implement GG and improve your training.)

[High Frequency Undulating Progression](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2020/01/): (HFUP) Training the same lift(s) daily by changing the reps/sets/weights each workout.

[Wave LP](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/bw6qg0/general_gainz_wave_lp/): 4x Week Full Body. (Built by /u/ctye85) I’ve built and ran a similar progression to Wave LP.

[General Gainz Body Building](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html): (GGBB) A body part split using supersets. This is the training plan I followed for most of 2021, in some form or another, as I was tinkering with what seemed to work best and changing the workouts as my recovery dictated. This means I was adjusting or changing exercises, order of exercises, volumes, and intensity, so that I could workout frequently – without training an under recovered muscle group. The linked post describes in greater detail a weekly progression outline, schedule options, exercises, supersets, etc.

With GGBB, I followed (mostly) a split of this nature:

Day 1: Legs

Day 2: Shoulders

Day 3: Back

Day 4: Arms

These were the muscle groups that were the focus in the workout. I would often do abs alongside legs or back, for example. (I did not train chest intentionally, but if that is your goal, then you can tailor GGBB to suit you.)

I would progress volume first, then once I hit a designated Rep Max (RM) target I would add weight and try to push that new weight to a higher RM. If in a workout I could not add reps to an RM set, I would do more reps in the sets that came after it.

Lift variations were used and rotated as I trained with GGBB. Such as doing SSB squat or Romanian deadlifts instead of the standard variety. Same for football bar press or incline bench. I used barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, cables, bands, TRX, etc.

The above linked posts detail the training plans I used during this period. Each was developed using General Gainz, which works by performing one or a combination of four actions to progress: Find/Hold/Push/Extend. Those concepts and associated progressions are also detailed in the above linked posts. (The GGBB post has a good intro to General Gainz.)

You can develop your own training plan using the GG framework. If you do, I have high confidence that you will be successful in achieving your lifting goals. GG provides a simple and intuitive organization and direction. Your consistency and patience produce the results.

My training is based in GG and so is my client’s training.

**How to Train Daily: Prioritize Recovery**

“Gains are made out of the gym” is a cliché.

One should not consider such a cliché the dominate factor in improving their physicality. People who say such things are often better at giving unsolicited advice than lifting weights.

To physically improve, it takes physical training. To consistently train, you need to recover – but that does not necessarily mean that sedentary days are required. There is nothing magical about staying out of the gym. Doing so does not guarantee an increased recovery rate.

If lifting regularly leaves you hobbled for a few days after, then you likely need more physical activity, not less. (And you also need to reassess how your training is set up. Follow a proven plan. Read the [/r/fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/).)

Do more general physical preparedness (GPP) work, like snow shoveling, my favorite, not.. If you don’t have snow, then just dig and fill the same hole in the dirt. If you don’t like those options, then push and pull a sled in the gym for an hour a few times per week. The point is that recovery is just as much about your work capacity as it is about your practices and habits outside the gym. None of which require staying out of the gym as a condition for success.

If you don’t want to lift weights or do manual labor daily, that’s fine. Go for walks, runs, bike – **do** something!

I have been able to recover from my workouts by prioritizing:

1.Eating and hydration.

2. Sleeping.

3. De-stressing.

People confuse not going to the gym with recovery because not doing something is easier than working on improving recovery habits. Knowing I had a workout tomorrow, I made those three things bigger priorities in my life. I was also able to better regulate my desire to absolutely crush myself, *because I have the weekend off and need to earn it*. (So I would say years ago.)

Time out of the gym is not the most important aspect of recovery. If it is for you, then you’re probably not prioritizing good recovery habits. An easy workout is better recovery than a hard night out partying, or a late night of Netflix, or a day full of stressed-out consumption of “news.”

Of the things listed above, I did the worst with eating. This has always been trouble for me, but I do think I improved a bit in this aspect these 1,000 days. Having always been a scrawny manlet, getting to 200 lbs. was my goal. I barely missed that. This is due to the many days where I forgot my lunch or was just too consumed by work to eat. I could do better here, and if I had, I know I would have had better results.

When it comes to nutrition, I have a consistent diet that is made up of rice, salad, eggs, and various meats. Often in the shape of a burrito.

I also eat a fair share of potatoes and bread but will limit those during a cut period when I am trying to lose weight. I do eat out a few times per month on average, but rarely more than once a week (if that). My most common meal is a salad with rice and beef. Since I was bulking for all of 2021, I simply increased the serving. In 2022, I’ll eat less, but typically the same kinds of foods.

Generally, my motto is: “If bulking, never be hungry. If cutting, always be.” And I try to bias my eating to the “Green Faces” practice (if it is green or had a face, eat it).

I tend to not track macros closely, nor calories. If I did, I would have had better results. 13+ years of training has developed my ability to gauge my own eating and practice good habits somewhat accurately and consistently. I could do better here, I admit.

As for hydration: I pee so often it sometimes annoys me.

Alcohol consumption is rarely more than a six pack per week. If I averaged out the number of beers drank over these 1,000 days, it would probably be one to two per week. Some weeks have more than others, especially if I find a beer I have not tried, and it turns out to be good.

I regularly get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. If I do not, then I try to squeeze in a nap. I try to nap as much as I can. One to three a week on average.

De-stressing can be hard. To do this I have tried to limit my media exposure, which I determined to be the greatest source of stress for me. Doing so has reduced worrying about things I cannot control. I admit that I could do better, and just delete every social media account and stop watching and reading any current events whatsoever – perhaps later down the road.

I have found that spiritual and philosophical practices are helpful in de-stressing and am working on improving this aspect of my life. Same for reading literature. My favorite book from last year’s reading was Hemingway’s *A Farewell to Arms*.

Regarding supplements, I infrequently consume protein powder. Perhaps 3 to 5 scoops per week. Many weeks not even that much. I try to focus on whole foods as best as I can, and supplement as may be necessary (they’re called supplements, after all). More protein powder is consumed during bulking periods for this reason, as it is easier to get in a few ounces of fluids with 30 grams of protein than it is to eat that much more beef, chicken, or fish. On reflection, I should always have an emergency shaker of protein, just in case I forget my lunch.

Additional supplements I use are creatine, vitamin D, ZMA, Arginine and Ornithine. I had (have) an unhealthy amount of caffeine daily, but I have recently switched to half-caff and have drastically reduced my energy drink consumption. I try to keep it less than 300mg daily.

At no point in these 1,000 days have I used prescription or otherwise obtained performance enhancing drugs such as hormones, SARMS, pro-hormones, or steroids. I am not a “lifetime natural.” For about one year, ending in 2016, I tried TRT. I did not find it that helpful and I could no longer justify the cost. Well before that I was a crackhead addicted to Jack3d, which was basically crystal meth… *remembers the good ol’ days* (they were, in fact, not).

**Summary**

Over 1,000 days ago I started lifting daily and have not stopped. I gained size, strength, and stamina. I have not overtrained. The condition of pre-existing injuries has improved and were only aggravated on occasion that I became a knucklehead and did more reps than I knew better to.

Additionally, I worked through my General Gainz training framework, further developing the concept, and many successful training plans in the process. Several are linked in this post. GG improved my training and my client’s training too. I hope this post improves your training similarly.

s8zjm1,weightroom,"[Program Review] The Notorious, PH3","**Results:**

While all my lifts went up a fair amount, I think that some of the strengths of this program aren’t particularly unveiled through singles. I became super technically proficient in all rep ranges and got consistently used to moving some particularly heavy ass weight on a daily basis. Regardless my results were:

*Lifts coming into the program:*

S: 405 (this was an RPE 10 absolute grind)

B: 245 (I had hit 235 before coming into this program with no spot and it moved so smooth I set it 10 lbs higher)

D: 500 (straps)

Bodyweight: 195

*Lifts after (going off projected AMRAPs as I did not want to do a taper just to peak in the gym for now.):*

S: 440

B: 265

D: 555

Bodyweight: 203

I included some physique update pictures. I feel like I added some mass to my frame, got a little fatter, and saw most of my gains in my arms, quads, and glutes.

**The History**

I began lifting around 2017 as a senior in highschool, and continued throughout college. However, I only really began taking my training in a more serious manner once COVID began in 2020. After that point, I entered a period of program-hopping as many intermediates seem to do, and went from nSuns 5/3/1, SBS, JNT 2.0, amongst a few others like Smolov for Bench and Deathbench as I had been chasing a 2 plate bench for longer than I care to admit. I had the most success with RPE and AMRAP style programs like Jacked and Tan and Jeff Nippard’s Powerbuilding before running this program, so I wanted to give a more rigid and volume heavy style of training with PH3.

**Modifications**

I didn’t really change much throughout the program, I just occasionally moved when rest days occurred earlier in the program. As it progressed and the fatigue set in, I began to trust them more and strictly adhered to when they were written.

**Nutrition:**

The only way I would have ever considered running this program for the first time was on a bulk, and it is probably the only way I could see someone being successful on it unless they have experience with it.

I came into the program starting at around 195lbs, having been bulking since around August, but I really made sure to ramp up the emphasis on calories and quality protein while running PH3. I started at probably around 3500 calories and ramped it up closer to 4000 as I moved through the intensity block.

A daily day of eating was typically something like this:

Breakfast:

Protein Bar

Premier Protein Shake

Lunch:

16oz of Egg whites

Costco Bagel w/Cream cheese

Banana

Preworkout Meal like 2 hours before training:

Dried mango/apricots

Banana

English muffin

15 minutes before lifting:

Preworkout

1.5 servings of fast digesting candy for carbs (typically Swedish Fish or Rice Krispy)

Dinner:

Cup of rice

8oz of Tofu

Snacks:

Like 600 cals of Peanut Butter

1.5 servings greek yogurt

Cheese/Sweet potato chips/oatmilk for more carbs and fats if needbe

Gatorade or Body Armor on long SBD days

I always made sure to always be around 200-220 grams of protein and as many carbs as possible.

**Supplements:**

Mulitivitamin

Fish oil

Creatine

**Thoughts on the program:**

The program is broken up into 3 month-long phases, Accumulation, Transition, and Intensity blocks.

Accumulation:

This phase seemed to set you up to get used to the amount of volume you would be working with and was a useful tool to refine your technique inside of that volume before the program ramps up. I had no problems with this month and found it really did help me adjust to what the coming months would bring. The one tweak I made to my training was comp pausing at the bottom of every bench rep vs allowing TnG. I feel like this allowed me to properly dial in my technique even further and did not allow me to get cheaty with reps or have too much variation between sessions.

Transition: This phase is fairly similar to the Accumulation phase while ramping up the weights across the board. It really was not too bad until I found myself getting a decent amount of elbow tendinitis from the benching and squatting volume towards the end of the phase. I did not skip a single other workout on this program, but skipped the final amrap day of week 4 to give myself a long 4 day weekend over Christmas to let my joints recover, and added some high rep, lighter weight Zottman curls, 21s, and hammer curls after each workout to try and get blood flow to the joints, and the tendinitis seemed to largely disappear.

Intensity Phase: This phase was monstrous, but really pushed me to my limits and showed me a level of grind I was capable of in the gym that I did not know I had in me. I would leave dripping sweat on 4/5 days, and allowed myself to take longer rests whenever needed to ensure I was completing all the reps. I have seen other reviews call this phase insane (which I could totally see with starting numbers higher than my own), but honestly I think it was realistic to get through so long as diet and recovery are dialed in. Working from home and COVID restrictions has made the extracurricular points of training and recovery really easy to focus on

**Overall:**

This is probably my favorite program that I have ever run, and I have never pushed myself as hard as PH3 has the past 3 months in the gym. Squatting 3X a week and moving towards heavy 5s and 3s during the last block was awesome, and I quickly discovered my work capacity for heavy squatting was much higher than I thought. My bench also took huge strides, as I went from being able to do 225 for a single at like an RPE 8.5 to doing 225 for 5x3 with pauses and realistically being able to move it for 5s. Deadlift is a lift I feel I could probably use a 3rd day on like squat as I think this lift improved the least. I was hitting rep max PRs and improved my work capacity; however it just did not feel quite as improved as the other 2 lifts. Still, my projected max moved up 55lbs per the program.

I am planning to run the program again with a few quality-of-life tweaks to it now that I have run it exactly as intended. I am going to swap out incline dumbbell press for an incline hammer machine press, as I think some of my elbow tendinitis not only came from slight overuse but pushing myself too hard on that Day 2 workout and getting the dumbbells into place for the incline press. A machine press will target the chest a bit more directly on the hypertrophy day and allow me to keep my joints fresher. My other tweak is primarily directed at that second day, but also the accessories on the other days. When running it a second time I am going to knock my numbers down a bit and focus more on contraction and not so much consistently adding weight. My accessories did add a fair bit of weight throughout the program, but I think the mentality of chasing numbers hindered me from milking my hypertrophy work as much I could. I will sub out weighted pullups for lat pulldowns, as I think with volume everywhere else, having that as a compound only wore down my joints and I can self-regulate and add weight slower on lat pulls. BFR training was an interesting addition and something I learned to love. It took some trial and error but I really do think it added size to my arms and allowed for additional hypertrophy at lower weights. Lastly, I’m adding in hanging leg raises and cable wood choppers on Days 1, 3, and 5 as I think some dedicated ab work would be beneficial.

**What Comes Next?**

I am going to continue bulking at around 3700-4k calories throughout this second run and will hopefully end the program at around 210-215lbs with my top few abs still visible before entering a maingain or slower cut in April. My goals lifts will be near 495lb squat, 300lb bench, and 585 deadlift, which while tough I think PH3 can continue to provide me with great results. Anyone who is an intermediate/fits into Layne Norton’s recommendation for Wilks before starting this should run it, as at worst I think it shows you how hard you can truly train.

rvg2n4,weightroom,[Program review] Tick-tick-boom,"TL;DR: This is a review of a general strength routine/program running as two 3 week cycles and a test week and/or deload week. Wanted to try programming, and this was the result. I’ve run the thing for about 6 months, and have seen really good progress.

# Background [or; “who are you, what is this, and why should I care?”]

I asked in the daily thread a while back whether it was ok to review your own program. The consensus seemed to be a “hmm, not sure, maybe? post and see”. This is my attempt at doing just that, let’s see if it gets nuked. If I break any rules by posting, I apologize.

You might find this read interesting if you’re an intermediate lifter interested in programming or someone who finds pleasure in picking other people's routines apart.This post is relevant to the greater community in the sense that it can spark discussion about potential pitfalls and possibilities when designing programs, especially for newer lifters such as myself.

I’m a 40 year old intermediate-ish lifter. I’ve been going to the gym on and off for a couple of years.  Let's say 6-7 months of semi-serious lifting in 2018, then 5-6 months off, rinse and repeat for 2019 and 2020. My background before that is more endurance related with strength work thrown in here and there. In january 2021 I once again got my shit together and headed to the gym, this time with a buddy. Previously I’ve done mostly PPL, now I joined my buddy in his perpetual 5x5-struggle while being acutely aware of the shortcomings of what we were doing. This led me down a path of binge-watching Alex Bromleys programming vids, reading SbS-posts, scouring LiftVault for something new to try, and a general interest in anything strength training related. I could’ve done 5/3/1, or one of Nuckols 28 programs, or something else. For some reason I didn't quite find anything tantalising enough. And programming didn’t seem **that** complicated, so I figured “hell, I’m just gonna try my own thing for the fun of it - keep it simple and see what happens”. And I kept it real simple. Perhaps stupidly so - calling this a program might be to exaggurate . But anyway, before I break it down for you, let’s get some results.

# Results

I ran the program from late June/early July 2021 to the week before Christmas of 2021. This is what happened. Numbers in kg, lbs in parenthesis.  When rep-based, estimated 1 rm are within \[brackets\] - if there are no brackets it's a true and tested 1 rm.

&#x200B;

|**Lift**|**Previous Lifetime PR**|**June 2021**|**December 2021**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Deadlift|180 kg  (397 lbs)|175 kg  (386 lbs)|210 kg  (463 lbs)|
|Squat|4x120 (4x264.5)  \[est 1rm **135** kg / 297.6 lbs\]|4x120 (4x264.5)  \[est 1rm **135** kg / 297.6 lbs\]|150  (330.7)|
|OHP|65  (143.3)|65  (143.3)|80  (176.4)|
|Bench Press|107,5  (237)|105  (231.5)|110  (242.5)|

&#x200B;

As you can see, I am by no means especially advanced. But I got significantly stronger during these past 6 months. I even managed to improve my bench press pr. Bench is my nemesis. Seriously, bench can go f\*\*k itself. Stupid bench.

“Damn there’s no stopping, look at me go”-lift: Deadlift.

“Yea well, progress is progress i guess”-lift: Squat

“O shit, didn’t see that one coming”-lift: OHP

Something that I would like to point out even before breaking down the program is that so far I’ve seen no tendencies towards stalling. Everything’s going up continuously, by some parameter or other. Not always from work out to work out, and not without hiccups, but definitely from cycle to cycle. I would continue running this if it wasn’t for me joining the SbS program party (and, for once, listening to people who actually know what they’re doing).

# Bodyweight, diet and supplements

**Bodyweight:**

June 2021: ca 82 kg (180-181 lbs)

Christmas 2021: ca 86-87 kg (\~190 lbs)

Not much to say here, really. My tactic was simply to try to eat reasonably well and top off with a sizeable protein shake every evening. I of course ended up at exactly 1.8 g protein/kg bw (no I didn’t). Perhaps I should count calories and macros. I don’t, sorry. Gained some muscle, gained some fat. Only supplement I’m using is Creatine, started taking it around halfway through.

Alright….

# The ~||Program||~

After browsing for a new program to try, the main reasons that I ended up with my own attempt can be summarized as:

* 3 days a week hits the sweet spot for my ability to commit, but finding a 3-day split that I liked was haaaard.
* Too much squatting. I don’t want to squat as much as you tell me to. Sorry.
* Playing around with workouts and percentages in excel was more fun than I had imagined!
* Yes, I’ve read the fittit-wiki . Shut up.

When I decided that ‘ok I’m doing this’ there were a couple of things that I wanted to address, a couple ideas I wanted to try, and a few pointers I’d picked up from my betters:

&#x200B;

* This is going to be a 3-day split
* 3 day split = full body workout (more or less)
* Spend less time dawdling
* Spend less time thinking - make a simple plan, stick to it, trust the process
* Take care not to fatigue my lower back more than it can handle. It tends to need a lot of rest. Perhaps due to piss-poor technique, perhaps due to a piss-poor lower back.
* Sub-max training sounds nice, let's try that. Don’t go balls out every time.
* Don’t chase big pb’s. Be patient.
* Periodization:
   * A general strength/volume block
   * A top strength block
   * A test week
   * deload and repeat
* Skip peaking. I’m not competent enough to design a good peaking block. Run a general strength training program, and if a pure peak is deemed necessary… find a nice pre-made template instead.
* And finally, my two Grand Ideas, my moment of Nirvana-level clarity (yea, no, but ok):
   * Straight sets are boring. The first set is always too light, the last too heavy.
   * Man, I spend too much time resting between sets. And setting rest timers.

What I ended up with was…

# Tick-tick-boom!

The **revolutionary** (not revolutionary), **innovative** (not innovative) and all out **fantastic** (decent) 7 week long 3 day split. It’s great! (It’s ok…)

I’m not going to analyze my thought process with regards to every little detail. Honestly, that’s mostly because I didn’t think it through *that* well. But here are the general ideas that i’ve of course not come up with myself and that are totally unoriginal:

* The complete cycle is 7 to 8 weeks long.
* Week 1-3 are **volume** weeks.
* Week 4-6 are **intensity** weeks / **heavy** weeks
* Week 7 is a test and/or deload week. True 1 rm max testing is not necessary (but fun), use 4-5 rm weights or whatever.
* Week 8 is an optional deload/test week, depending on body status.
   * Could also be inserted between week 3 and 4 instead if I'm overworked.
* Repeat cycle with weights determined by the test week results.

Looking closer at the two main 3 week cycles, they follow a similar pattern (but using different mechanisms):

* Both of them should start with sub-max work and feel quite **easy** week 1, and maybe even allow for some recovery.
* Week 2 is more intense, but manageable
* Week 3 is a grind. But these weeks are the **only ones** where you touch weights that \*should\* be close to a repetition max effort.

Looking at specific workouts:

* Sessions should be around 90 minutes max including warm up and stretching
* 1 or 2 main lifts for the day (these of course being bench, squat, dead and ohp - and also kinda-somewhat-sorta pull-ups)
* 1-3 accessory exercises. The accessory work can and should change between cycles depending on weak points and fun factor.
* 2-3 auxiliary exercises

Nothing revolutionary so far. But here’s where things begin to take shape:

* The working sets of the main lifts are run as a **descending ladder**. The ladder and/or weight changes depending on where you’re at within the cycle.
* All exercises are run using set **intervals**. Time for heavy deads? Clock says 220 seconds, when it beeps you go, when it beeps again you go again.  Dawdling during the set? Suit yourself.
* The combination of a descending ladder and an interval timer should - was my thinking - allow for fine tuning a progression and interval where sets are sorta equally hard (and time is used efficiently). And it kind of works.
* Accessory work is run using straight sets. Mostly because I’m too lazy to keep track of more ladders and I wanted them to be sub-max anyway.
* Auxiliary exercises are run as a circuit with a short interval time. Pump time!

Is this where I explain the name?Clock goes tick-tick. Clock goes beep. Boom! You lift.

Tick-tick-boom. It's a cool name. Programs need names. I'm sticking with it.

I would like to post the entire spreadsheet of my last cycle to give a better idea of what the hell is going on, but I don’t think there’s room for that. I’ll have to try to explain using language instead, I suppose. Let’s have a look at **Squats:**

Squats, volume week 1:

* 4 sets. 8, 7, 6, 5 reps
* Weight: 11-12 rm
* Interval: 180 seconds.
   * Proper interval has to be determined by practice

Squats, volume week 2:

* 4 sets, 9, 8, 7, 6 reps
* All else stays the same.

Squats, volume week 3:

* 10, 9, 8, 7 reps
* All else stays the same

All you’re doing during these weeks is adding a rep to each set. No biggie. And only week 3 should you be close to a max effort. The volume cycle is done, time for heavy work.

Squats, heavy work week 1:

* 4 sets. 5, 4, 3, 2+ reps. Last set is an amrap. Don’t lose form, don't fail.
* Weight; 8-9 rm
* Interval:  \~200 seconds. A bit longer than during volume weeks.
* The result of the amrap set gives an idea about how much you should bump up the weight next week.

Squats, heavy work week 2:

* Weight: 7-8 rm.
* All else stays the same

Squats, heavy work week 3:

* Weight: 6-7 rm.
* All else stays the same

Again, only week 3 is close to a max effort (besides the amrap). But this time it’s due to changing weights rather than changing reps. So during volume weeks you end up touching max weights for a high volume set, but during heavy weeks for a heavy weight set. Makes sense?

And if shit is way too light anyway, by all means add another set here and there (and perhaps go for heavier rm's next cycle). This is pretty low volume, I know.

In summary and a bit simplified my workouts looked more or less like this:

&#x200B;

|**Exercise**|**Volume weeks**|**Heavy weeks**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Main lifts.  Long interval.|8,7,6,5 - add 1 rep each set next week. (start 6,5,4,3 for deads)|5,4,3,2+, add weight next week (4,3,2,1+ for deads)|
|Accessories.  Medium interval.|\~3x10-12, \~rpe8|\~4x6-8|
|Pump circuit. 2-3 exercises.   Short interval (70 sec).|3x12-15 per exercise|3x10-12  per exercise|

&#x200B;

What did I do as accessories and auxiliaries?I switched them out from time to time. Last cycle looked like this:

**Volume, monday:**

* Main: Squat and Bench.
* Acc: Pendlay row
* Aux circuit: Chin up, lat raise, sit up

**Volume, wednesday:**

* Main: OHP and Pull Up
* Acc: Front squat, DB row
* Aux circuit: Shrug, DB curl, sit up

**Volume, friday:**

* Main: Deadlift
* Acc: Arnold Press & Split Squat (SS), Pause Bench
* Aux circuit: Lat raise, DB curl, push up

**Heavy, monday:**

* Main: Squat and Bench
* Acc: Pendlay row
* Aux circuit: DB curl, Dragon flag progression

**Heavy, wednesday:**

* Main:  OHP and Weighted Pull Up
* Acc: Sumo deadlift
* Aux circuit: Rolling tricep extension, Face pull, Lat raise

**Heavy, friday:**

* Main: Deadlift
* Acc: Push Press, DB press
* Aux circuit: Lat raise, DB curl, dragon flag progression

I winged the weights for accessories and auxiliaries aiming for roughly an rpe 8, maybe a bit more during heavy weeks, not really caring much as long as I saw some progress. The only thing I really paid super close attention to was the progression of the main lifts.

When test week rolled around, I usually did a super light workout on monday, and then tested new maxes wednesday and friday. Extra deload weeks were used sparingly,

# Summary

The idea was that this type of progression of the main lifts  would allow for slow but continuous progress, both as a “feeling” and in practice. Come test week, a new 5 rm might be doable. And it was. Every cycle I could bump out an extra rep or two when the time came. It might be due to the fact that I was in the gym regularly and not thanks to the program, but it worked. And a pump circuit at the end felt great.

There were a few hiccups. I’ve had some shoulder issues preventing me from giving my  best at both bench press and OHP. As you can see from the results however, the end result was pretty damn good for the OHP and acceptable for the bench. With regards to the bench, I actually wasn’t all that worried - mostly frustrated. My base strength and work capacity kept going up steadily. I suspected that the pb would come eventually. The OHP pb was surprising though, since I actually had to skip most of the heavy OHP training the last cycle due to shoulder pain.  And I have to admit that the progression scheme had to be adjusted from time to time during the cycles for both OHP and bench. I couldn’t always meet my rep and/or weight goals. Which is fine. I did alright on test weeks.

During the test weeks the initial idea was to just go for new 4-5 rm maxes. I did stick to this on squats (until I didn’t), the rest of the lifts I went for true maxes more often than not - maxing out is too much fun. It was surprising that even though I didn't do heavy singles or even doubles or triples, I could still bust out a new true 1 rm for most lifts during every test week. Didn’t expect that.

Overall the program has worked really, really well. My body’s been feeling mostly alright, even if not as well rested as I predicted. I’ve learned a thing or two about the correlation between estimated rm maxes and how they actually feel. I’ve set a continuous string of slow but steady pb’s. I’ve gained muscle. And I made pretty big pb jumps during the last test week in all lifts (yea, 2.5 kg bench press PR, I’m counting you too). Last cycle OHP went from 72,5 to 80 kg, deadlift from 190 to 210 kg.  I’m not really sure what clicked the last time around, but it sure did. I suspect that this might lead to a plateau if I tried a new cycle, but who knows. Anyway, I’m super happy with the results! My biggest goal was to get a 200 kg deadlift before new years, and I crushed it.

This is getting long winded, and I’m not sure I’m making any sense at all. I’ve got loads more I should probably say but forget what, and I want to post more stats and stuff but don’t know how. So perhaps it’s time to shut up. One last thing to add might be that I sometimes threw in an extra workout here and there if I felt like it. For example, I’d never pulled sumo before so during september/october I did a couple of practice sets every tuesday.

Final thought: This isn’t anything new, nor in all probability anywhere close to optimal. But it’s mine and I like it.

Thanks for reading!

Questions? Roast? Burn? Mod removal? Shoot.

Edit:   
Oh yea, i forgot something kinda important: I usually cut down somewhat on the accessory and (mainly) auxiliary work as the heavy weeks progressed. How much and when my body got to decide.

rddv9u,weightroom,[Program Review] Eight Months of Doggcrapp Training after lockdown - getting bigger and stronger on a few sets a week,"**TL;DR:** Doggcrapp is a good option for anyone who wants to focus on bodybuilding/aesthetics but also loves pushing heavy weight in the gym. I think I made decent progress and will likely come back to it quite soon. See full wall of text that is probably full of typos below. 

# Background/training history:

I've been weight training since mid-2013, when I was in high school trying to get stronger for rowing. I got into strength training pretty quickly and started to run well-known strength programs in the offseason. I spent most of those early years alternating between lifting for strength and lifting for sports, though getting bigger/leaner was always a side goal. I always enjoyed going for rep PBs and (maybe because of my background in an endurance sport) tended to be better at higher reps.

By 2019 I had hit solid intermediate numbers (235kg squat, 140kg bench, 250kg deadlift @\~105kg) and started trying bodybuilding-style training. I ran Doggcrapp (DC) training until early 2020, and had just started a more 'powerbuilding' style approach when COVID hit. Between March 2020 - April 2021 I was only able to train in a gym for around five weeks. Honestly, I also just took a step back from lifting/fitness for a long time during this period. I did a decent amount of bodyweight work at the start of the pandemic and before things opened up, but otherwise was really just doing the occasional set of pullups/pullups and a fair amount of walking/hiking.

I was pretty happy to be back in the gym in April 2021 and decided to run DC training again. Though I'd been doing bodyweight stuff, I felt a bit like a beginner again. Was nice to experience noob gains for the second time!

# Results

Since this is what a lot of people like to see, I think it's worth just going straight to the results up front. I think it's hard to draw too many conclusions from my results since I was coming back from a while off the gym. It's always easier to regain lost ground than to break new barriers, and I was definitely doing that for a decent chunk of my time training DC. Having said that, I'm pretty happy with my progress and think DC was a great way to get back into the gym.

**Physique**

I bulked until around August, then cut until mid-September, and have been bulking again since then. 

[Here's an album with a photo at 100kg from April, one after cutting back down to 100kg in September, and one at 105kg from a few days ago](https://imgur.com/a/O8LNaye). I'm around 6'4 or 6'5 for reference. 

I'm not the biggest or leanest, but I think overall I made some good progress, even considering that I was getting back into training after a break. I was significantly leaner at the same weight in September than I was in April, and probably still a bit leaner now despite being 5kg heavier. Quite excited to see where I am when I cut down again in a few months.

**Strength**

DC isn't really focussed on hitting 1RMs or doing traditional powerlifting/strength training exercises so I'm just going to put rep PBs from a few broadly similar lifts together to demonstrate strength progress. Will show all-time bests, numbers in April (about two weeks back in the gym) and numbers now.

&#x200B;

|All time bests|April 2021|December 2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Squat: 205kgx7, 140kgx25|High bar squat: 130kgx8|Paused high bar squat: 175kgx6, 140kgx18|
|Flat dumbbell bench: 50kgx7|Incline DB bench: 36kgx12|Low incline DB bench: 48kgx7|
|Deadlift: 225kgx6|Deadlift: 170kgx3|Deadlift: 230kgx6|

I also hit a few all-time PBs in other exercises including hitting 25 neutral grip pullups at around 100kg bodyweight and pendlay rowing (not very strict) 150kgx5.

# About Doggcrapp training

**The basics** 

You can read all about the history of DC training elsewhere so I'll summarise it fairly quickly -  Doggcrapp was the username that Dante Trudel used online in the early 2000s. He started posting about his training philosophy on old forums and many people ended up using his suggestions. Dante has coached a few IFBB pros and is generally quite well-respected in the bodybuilding community.

After doing a lot of research into DC training it became pretty clear that DC is more a set of principles than a specific program, and Dante has said this in the past. DC training is a high intensity training method focussed on building muscle. Although the end goal is building muscle, DC is built on progressive overload. The goal is to keep adding weight across a range of movements - 'beating the logbook' is a commonly used phrase. 

 It's generally low volume and high frequency, with a big focus on rest-paused sets. Rest-paused sets involve doing one set to failure, waiting around 20-40 seconds, then taking the same weight to failure, waiting another 20-40 seconds and going to failure again. The general advice is to aim for 11-15 total reps on most body parts, though sometimes this number might be higher. Some exercises aren't done rest-paused (quad and back stuff, generally).

**The splits** 

The traditional DC split is run three times per week with body parts split across two sessions. If you google Doggcrapp training you'll find quite a few articles outlining this split, but it basically looks like this:

&#x200B;

|'A' sessions|'B' sessions|
|:-|:-|
|Chest - one rest paused set, 11-15 reps total|Biceps - one rest paused set, 15-20 reps total|
|Shoulders - same as above|Forearms - one straight set |
|Triceps - one rest paused set, 15-20 reps total|Calves - one set of 10-12 reps, holding for 15 second in the stretched position|
|Back width - one rest paused set, 11-15 reps|Hamstrings - one rest paused set, 15-20 reps total (though for things like RDLs Dante recommends straight sets)|
|Back thickness - one or two straight sets |Quads - one straight set followed by a 20+ rep widowmaker |

All sets above are taken to failure. For each type of session ('A' and 'B'), you will select three different groups of exercises. This means you repeat each exercise once every two weeks. After failing to meet rep targets on an exercise a few times, you cycle it out and select a new one for that slot. 

This is the split Dante recommends for beginners and people starting DC training. There is another split which involves training four days per week in a three-way PPL split. This was traditionally recommended for advanced athletes but I've seen Dante on instagram recently suggest this for intermediates. In this split, Dante recommends adding an extra 'widowmaker' set of around 20 reps on a separate exercise for weaker body parts. 

Finally, Dante has posted a five-way split on Instagram for advanced athletes. I know the post where he outlines the split is quite early in his post history but can't find it at the moment! I should also add that for all of these splits, Dante recommends doing 'extreme stretching' - stretching a muscle under load after training that body part. If you look up DC stretches you can find a list of the recommended ones.

**Exercise selection**

In terms of exercise selection, Dante recommends doing exercises with big 'bang for your buck', especially on the traditional split as you're only doing three exercises per body part every fortnight. He also recommends doing exercises that are easy to add weight and progress on. Generally, this means things like incline bench presses might be better than the pec deck. There's loads more detail to go into but hopefully this has given a basic overview of common DC recommendations. 

# My programming

During the last eight months, I've run two different splits. For the first little while, I ran the original split with the only modification being that I generally trained one day on/one day off rather than 3x per week (so a slight increase in frequency). This was a good way of getting back into the gym. 

I got a bit more creative for the next little while. I ended up running the 3-way split four times a week, but added a couple more exercises/a bit more volume. I set it up like this: 

&#x200B;

|A (push) sessions|B (pull) sessions |C (legs) sessions |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Chest - one compound exercise for 11-15 rest paused reps|Biceps - 15-20 rest paused reps |Calves - straight set of 10-20 reps holding in stretched position|
|Chest - one straight set of 10-20 reps of an isolation movement|Forearms - straight set of 10-20 reps |Hamstrings - 15-20 rest paused reps, or two straight sets when doing RDLs/SLDLs|
|Shoulders - one compound exercise for 11-15 RP reps|Back width (vertical pull) - 11-15 reps rest paused|Adductors/glutes - straight set of 10-20 reps |
|Shoulders - straight set of 10-20 reps in an isolation movement|Back isolation (e.g. straight arm pushdowns, machine rows) - straight set 10-20 reps|Quads - compound movement for one set of 4-8, then a widowmaker|
|Triceps - compound exercise for 15-20 rest paused reps|Back thickness (deadlift variation or heavy row) - one set of 4-8 reps, one set of 8-12 reps|Quads - one straight set of 10-20 in an isolation/lighter movement|
|Triceps - straight set of 10-20 reps in an isolation movement|Rear delts - straight set of 10-20 reps |Abs - either a couple of straight sets or one rest paused set |

I had two variations of each sessions, which meant I repeated exercises once every week and a half. 

Happy to give examples of specific sessions (with exercises, weights and reps) if that would be helpful. I followed general guidelines on exercise selection and tended to (attempt to) lift like a bodybuilder rather than strength athlete - focussing on making things tougher rather than moving the most weight (though progressing as far as possible within the confines of that form). I did weighted stretching after each muscle group. 

I didn't put this all in a spreadsheet or anything, just ended up tracking things in OneNote. I usually swapped exercises out after failing to make improvements twice in a row. 

# Thoughts on the training

I really like DC training overall. I think it's definitely worth adapting to fit your needs after giving the traditional split a go. Although people on the old forums were quite dogmatic, I think it's fine to play around with the methods a bit as long as you've given the basic recommendations a go and stick to the core principles.

**The sets** 

Rest-paused training is probably the most notable thing about DC training. I think it's a really good way of training 'beyond' failure. Hitting a wall on an exercise and going back to another hard set shortly afterwards, then doing that again is difficult. I think headspace is really important here - you need to be absolutely on it during that time, I found the fact that this was my only chance to hit an exercise for the next week or two quite motivating, as I knew I had to leave it all in the gym. I tended to just count about ten deep breaths before going at it again - I think this probably ended up being on the higher end of the recommended break, but I've also noticed from videos of people training DC-style that most people take closer to 45 seconds than 20. One thing I think I could improve on is focussing on using the same form throughout all sets, and aiming to push to failure using that form. I think this would help make sure that you're keeping the focus on growing the specific muscle group, and may also reduce injury risk. 

I also enjoyed doing the exercises that don't use rest-pause style training. Squatting for a heavy set of 4-8 was fun, and following up on that with a widowmaker (usually after having done hamstrings etc. beforehand) was miserable but I think it helped me grow. 'Back thickness' exercises (deadlifts, heavy rows) were also done using heavy straight sets and I quite liked this. DC-style calf training is pretty crazy - it's just one set on a small body part, but because you hold in a stretched position for quite a while this set can end up taking a couple of minutes.

I did do weighted stretching, which I know a lot of people skip. I have no way of knowing whether this had any additional benefit, but I don't think it hurts. One idea I had was replacing weighted stretching with isometric exercises for relevant body parts (a couple of the stretches e.g. holding dumbbells in a fly position are already kind of like this). Didn't end up doing this, but might do when I go back to this type of training. 

**The exercises** 

I have quite a few specific thoughts here so will just list a few things I noticed about exercise selection.

* Overall, I really like that DC puts the same focus on every exercise and encourages you to focus on increasing your strength on every movement. I think this is really beneficial when compared to just chucking a couple of sets of curls in after compound exercises, at least for me. 
* I hadn't used machines too much in the past, but I think that compound movements on machines (e.g. plate-loaded incline press) can be really useful for this type of training. 
* Doing rest-paused sets with dumbbell presses are hard if you don't have someone helping you get the weight up for those second two parts of the rest-paused sets. I think in the future I might switch these exercises to straight sets. 
* It's useful to just use common sense when planning which exercises you slot into each session. If possible, try to separate similar movements so that they aren't too close together (e.g. move RDLs away from deadlifts). 
* You often do the hardest exercises (e.g. squats and deadlifts) last. I was a bit sceptical of this in the past but ended up really enjoying it. It might mean a slight drop in performance, but I felt like I would be more fresh for the smaller movements, and often could feel my muscles in those bigger movements (e.g. back in deadlifts) better.

**The split/layout**

I personally prefer training four or five times a week which is part of the reason I wanted to try the PPL-style split. The traditional split is effective, but I generally just prefer like spending a bit more of my time in the gym. I also prefer a PPL setup to the upper/lower(+biceps) setup in the classic split. 

I quite liked adding a set of an isolation exercise after a compound exercise for the same body part. Dante only recommends doing this for a couple of weak muscle groups, but I don't think I suffered from adding a tiny bit more volume. Probably also worth adding that I tried to get a decent amount of volume in during warm up sets - nothing crazy or taxing, but was useful as a way of practicing form and preparing for the big set.

# Thoughts on diet/other factors

**Diet/recovery**

I didn't really follow Dante's recommendations on diet. He recommends eating *a lot* of protein. While I do get a decent amount (generally aim for 200+g), I don't eat meat and thought some of the higher recommendations would be a bit tough to reach. Happy to go into more specifics about my individual diet, but I generally eat a lot of rice + veggie protein sources (tofu, meat alternatives, beans, eggs etc.), oats/cereal, and protein powder. I have been a lot stricter with diet in the past and could (probably should) have been stricter with my diet these past months. 

For supplements, I use whey protein, a pre-workout, and creatine when I remember to take it. My recovery/sleep is about average. My work hours aren't usually too crazy but the work can get quite stressful/high-pressure. I generally sleep 6 or 7 hours a night. Although I have heard people say DC training can cause injuries, I only got one very minor niggle doing deadlifts and this went away in a week. 

**Cardio** 

Dante recommends doing fasted LISS cardio a few times a week. I have tried this when I ran DC training in the past but my cardio was more sporadic this time around. I tend to maintain a decent level of cardio, though nothing close to where I was when I used to row. In addition to occasional cardio after training, I should also mention that I cycle for around 45 minutes every day when commuting. This isn't too strenuous but probably does mean I maintain some base level of fitness.

**PEDs**

I know that Dante also gives a lot of specific advice about PEDs and how to stay healthy using them. I obviously wasn't really interested in that side of things, but sounds like it could be helpful to enhanced people out there.

# Final thoughts - who should try DC training and other interesting resources

**Who should run DC**

You see a lot of people doubting DC training online, and I can kind of see where they're coming from. It rounds roughshod to a lot of common wisdom - volume is quite low, exercises aren't done too frequently, everything is taken to failure. Because of this, I see a lot of people saying that it won't work, or that it won't work for naturals. I think this is wrong - while you should probably run something different if you're only just getting into the gym, I think DC training can work for anyone intermediate or above. I have no clue whether it's *optimal*, but it works. 

Having said that, I don't think DC training is necessarily for everyone. A few points below: 

* DC training is good for people who are time-poor - you might only train for three hours a week on the three day split. However, you *really* need to commit during those hours - you have very few sets to grow each muscle, which means taking things to absolute failure is essential IMO.
* Doggcrapp really was designed for bodybuilders, so I think the main goal should be gaining muscle when running this program. That doesn't mean it's just good for bodybuilders - I'm sure other athletes looking to gain muscle would benefit. I have no competitive ambitions in any iron sport and just wanted to get more jacked, and I think my demographic is well-suited to it. 
* DC training is great for people wanting to gain 'general' strength across a range of movements, but maybe not if you want to get really good at specific lifts. You don't really practice lifts frequently or do much volume when you are training them. Also, at least IME and from observing top level strength athletes, it seems like doing a lot of submaximal work is *generally* better to optimise strength performance. Again, though, I'm sure anyone could use DC during an offseason/hypertrophy period. 
* Ultimately it's about what you enjoy - if you love taking things to failure and pushing numbers in high rep sets, DC is for you. If not, then there are probably tonnes of other methods you could try. If you're unsure, I'd recommend giving DC a try as an intro to this style of training. 

**Other resources**

One last thing to note is that through DC training I got introduced to high intensity bodybuilding training more broadly. This was really first introduced by Arthur Jones and popularised by Mike Mentzer's 'Heavy Duty' training. Dorian Yates then adapted it to win six Mr Olympias. I think looking into these people can be useful as background, and kind of want to give either Heavy Duty or Dorian's blood and guts training a try. 

In terms of modern day people - Jordan Peters (Traindebyjp) is a bodybuilding coach who trains people and creates programs using these principles. In terms of IFBB pros, Dusty Hanshaw uses DC training and you can find videos of him and Dante training recently. James Hollingshead and Iain Valliere also follow a broadly high intensity approach and are competing at the very top level of bodybuilding. Joe Bennett (hypertrophy coach) also seems to lean in this direction of training style.  Ben Pollack has some useful videos and other resources on this type of training. Lastly, I've seen u/iSkeezy write some interesting stuff about this style of training and found some of his comments/posts really useful. All of these people are great additional resources IMO! 

**My plans** 

As for my plans, I'm going to jump into the program party in January and give strength training a go again - won't get to some of the crazy numbers people here are doing, but I think I've got a good foundation to hit some PBs. I'll very likely go back to some form of high intensity bodybuilding training after this, but wanted to have a bit of a change/break. I also kind of want to have a go at some erg (rowing machine) training again, but I'm sure my views on that will change when I'm in the middle of a 2k.

Lets talk about the final 4 weeks which went horribly if we are being honest.

**4 Weeks Out:** Fat burners come back in, cardio comes up. In my head its time to dig out the final push to really make my hamstrings pop.  My weight had been kinda stagnantly high, so i did a cheat day monday and it worked well (wouldve been better as a controlled refeed), bringing my weigh down a few lbs from 200-201 to 195.6 by the end of the week. test was lowered as well with masteron replacing the mgs lost to help lower some water retention and improve the ""hard"" look. the end of this week had me in a spot where i was honestly shocked and impressed with what i had done. i was lean and looking like i was going to be in seriously good shape. despite all the cravings, i felt like everything i dieted for was here and felt one of the highest i could in prep. this week i had made 2 weeks worth of progress in one. i was very excited to get on stage as i thought i would look seriously impressive with 3 weeks left. and it goes all downhill from here. 

**3 Weeks Out:** i start this week with the mistake that snowballs my entire rest of prep into disaster. First, on sunday the 31st, i ate an overcooked steak that pretty much broke my tooth and prevented me from chewing on my left side. dentist said dying nerve, lot of pain, this really makes things harder on me.  i also had absurd amounts of pain where TMJ usually is, maybe a bit lower on the jaw. i couldnt explain it, and neither could the dentist other than it was from the dying nerve. however, the biggest mistake that snowballs my prep was one that started out as good intentions but turned horrible. my wife tells me my daughter and her are going trick or treating. i tell her ok ill come. this was where it goes wrong. my wife assumed i wasnt coming because duh, prep + candy is a stupid idea. i tell her i didnt wanna miss a holiday while she was young. so while trick or treating, i had a couple pieces of candy which ended up being pretty much 50+% of her candy (shes super picky and only eats straight hersheys chocolate or m&ms, so left me with plenty to eat). bad, and i feel guilty, but kinda shrug it off. however, the next day i end up eating the rest of her candy, and the ice cream in the fridge, and some other snacks. trying to figure out how to salvage this, i decide to take it as a mock peak carb up/dry out as i was very full and slightly spilled and somehow had to turn this bad thing into a good thing. i alter my diet and water the next day, and wake up dry as hell and looking sharp. awesome, my protocol works and that leaves me some confidence until the next 3 days. after the next couple days, i realize that i developed a binge eating disorder. one day i had eaten so much and was so uncomfortable, that i had to throw up just to try and make space in my stomach so it didnt hurt. i have never felt so out of control before. it was quite literally like my logic brain was telling me to stop and understood everything that was wrong and how easy it would be to just walk away, but i wasnt in control of my movements. if i wasnt so stupid as to ""buy these snacks for after the show"" so early, i couldve prevented a lot of this. so huge tip for the future, dont be an idiot. dont buy food for later in prep, because it wont last til later. anyways, the binging and guilt was bad, and in order to try to make up for it i swapped 50-75% of my cardio for HIIT. not that this removes the guilt, but i had to do something with the show coming and me now obliterating my diet. it appeared by the end of the week i had pretty much not made progress, but didnt seem to lose any either. motivation is now at an all time low, i dont even want to do the show anymore. all i want to do is get back to normal life. 

**2 Weeks Out:** I practically give up this week. i stopped weighing myself and tracking my calories. i didnt see a point, as i knew what my diet had to look like in order to keep going, but the frustration of binging occasionally just left me so demoralized that it didnt seem to matter about tracking anything (although all the food started to normalize my sleep more which technically is a bad sign at this point in prep). my tooth pain only made things worse. chewing a lot of foods caused me a lot of discomfort, but i knew that soft melting foods that happened to be delicious didnt. the pain one morning got so bad (first thing upon waking and drinking water was always the worst) that i went to the ER. no signs of infection, didnt notice the clicking etc for TMJ, so just given antibiotics and pain meds and somehow after that day it slowly got better even without taking any of the meds. the days where i was dieting well was egg whites, chicken, turkey, and spinach/asparagus. the hyper restriction obviously doesnt help with binge eating and i was very aware of that, but i really felt like i had no choice with the show coming. and i wasnt going to drop out, no matter how much i wanted to quit. 

**Peak Week:** i took a weigh in sunday just to see where i was at. 199.8. weight cap was 197, and at that point youd think i would get it together right? wrong. sunday/monday i binged again and ate up a storm. realizing my week was slowly disappearing and i was actually in danger, i needed to start figuring things out. still, weds morning i weighed 205.4. buddies in the gym told me i should get on stage like that which i responded to that being really hard considering im 8.5lbs over the cap. my original plan of peaking was now out the window because i was way to far over the cap. realizing now what had to be done, i had to dry out for the weigh in and then reload and dry out again for the following morning. i knew this wasnt going to be good as tricking your water systems this much was less than ideal. weds night i go to bed weighing 212.6, meaning i needed to drop 15.6lbs in 1.5 days. i run my dry out process thursday (205.8lbs thursday pre bed), and friday i wake up 198.8lbs. almost there. i had 2oz of water to take supplements, and that was it til weigh in. no food, didnt think i would need to do any sweating so didnt bother with cardio. leave for check ins weighing 196.8. still no food and water, i finally weigh in at 195.4. immediately pound gatorade, and begin rehydrating and eating. ive got time til first coat of tan, so i go back to the hotel room, drink a mix of whey/dextrose, and start pumping up. head back to get tanned, eat a little, drink a lot, come back to finish. ended up going overboard on the food that night, but i chose foods i know dont bloat me so i wasnt horribly concerned (pop tarts). accidentally spilled a little water on myself and watched the split of my abs tan slowly disappear. lesson learned, eat/drink with clothes. over the course of 5 hours post weigh in (3pm-8pm)  i had consumed 1.5 gallons of fluid and eaten 4500 calories/675g carbs (literally had 5 packets of pop tarts among other things). time for water cut off, so pre bed i take 1/4 of a dyazide (ooooh spooky scary diuretics) and take a benadryl and knock out weighing 205.6lbs. shockingly, i didnt pee nearly as often throughout the night as i had been all week and was worried i didnt dry out very much. woke up weighing 197.4lbs and looked pretty dry, so i was happy. 

**Show Day:** this was it. im tanned, dry, and thirsty. the **absolute worst** ^^^minor **thing** happened this morning. the lighting in the hotel room was atrocious. for the life of me no matter what lights i had on or off, curtains opened or not, natural lighting or not, i COULD NOT find a good lighting for pics. devastated feeling like i did all this for nothing, i pack all my stuff up after attempting for an hour to find good spots and head to the venue after eating a small meal of carbs, protein, and fat (about 2 bites into the meal, i remember last night and put a shirt on. a couple bites later, i drop a honey covered rice cake right on my chest and instantly feel big brain for remembering my lesson from last night). also, during the posing checks, my wife and i decided to make a last minute posing change on my front double bicep. rather than spike my toe, and bend my knee, we went with a straight leg to bring out deeper lines but i think at the cost of some top quad separation. get to the venue, kinda long line to get last coat applied for tan, talking to a bunch of guys, eat high carb high sodium meal about 1.5-2 hours out, and enjoying the final moments. meet some seriously cool people, catch up with friends who got their early, and head back stage to pump up. mens bbing goes first, then classic. i drink my pump product (ugh water, so delicious despite only being 4oz), eat some sea salt chocolate for a quick energy/sodium fix, and begin to slowly pump up. backstage was packed, and there was seriously impressive dudes back there. it didnt bother me, ever since friday the only thing on my mind was ""i cant wait for this to be over"" and about half the guys i talked to were thinking the same thing. my buddy comes back from the lightweight class telling me he thinks he has it and im stoked for him. i didnt bother trying to pose in the mirrors back stage, the lighting wasnt good and i wasnt going to change anything. line up back stage for true novice with my new buddy i met during tanning and another dude who did bbing. i looked at this dude and thought ""dam, hes pretty shredded and jacked i dont think i can even win true novice now."" we talk about back poses and how i dont like them cuz i have a shit back. the bber tells me to hit it and gives me a tip to adjust it (which im aware of just didnt really care, but nice dude!). i was under the impression our opening routine was 45 seconds, but apparently its only 30 so i had to keep in mind my transitions and decided to cut a pose. i step up on side stage nervous, and the moment the called my name and number it was gone. 

**Stage Time:** i step out and see hundreds of people out there and im nothing but excited and happy, nerves are gone. i get center stage and start posing and all i could think of was ""this is where i belong. this was all worth it."" i finish my routine, and they bring us all out for comparisons. now, everyone always says to practice smiling when posing and i hardly ever bothered. i now realize for me, that advice is horse shit. i dont need to practice it because on stage i couldnt stop smiling i was loving it so much. im in #3 spot and they immediately put me in #2. im thinking ""yea, that guy is pretty peeled."" we hit FDB and SC, and they move me to the middle. im stoked, we go through the rest of the poses and they send us off with me finishing in the middle. happy to hear that im winning true novice at least. i step off stage only to be back in line for novice. i feel my left quad almost cramping cuz its my main flexed quad and start trying to stretch it out and move it a bit. i see the line up for my novice class and see this pretty big dude, huge chest and back, round muscle bellies and go ""well he looks great, at least i won true novice."" tell my buddy doing novice A good luck knowing hes going to win since i saw his look from a show 3-4 weeks prior. sure enough he wins, and we go on. im in #2 spot, again no quarters. we hit FDB, SC, and BDB. we turn around and they call me to switch into the middle. im hyped up now, in a spot to possibly win the class. confidence is high, posing is sharp. they send us off with me in the middle. 2 for 2, but now im almost right back in line for open class. now, im in line and at this point shit got real. these dudes were the real deal. hard as nails, dry as fuck, and just huge. im right before my buddy who won novice A. we go out 1 by 1 to hit 1 pose and stand to the side. so me and my buddy are side stage holding a front relaxed, and more than half these guys coming out still have 30 second routines to do. we start complaining about how they shouldve sent those guys out first cuz now we are standing here forever holding a pose. im watching these guys come out and just am so impressed, knowing that i need to clean it up next show if this is what it takes. they call top 5, and my buddy is 5th. im standing on the side thinking ""dam missed top 5 oh well. wanted to try to stand next to my buddy for a comparison."" then the last 6 of us come out, im on the edge. we hit a couple poses and they move me to split the middle. finish poses, we leave and im somewhere just outside of that first call out. so close! but overall happy with whats gone on. its now my break time, as they have to do mens physique, and all the womens divisions before we start finals. tell my class D bud good luck, and head out to find friends and family. find everyone, and we hang outside of the expo all just talking, catching up with people i havent seen in a long time, eating the cookies and cupcakes they brought, drinking some but not a lot of water. theyre showing me pics, and telling me i looked amazing and my posing was super clean. im just happy its almost over, and was so thankful for all the support. 6 people from my direct circle at the gym were there to support me, and we ran into a few other people from my gym at the show that we knew. there was also like over a dozen people wearing the gyms clothing including multiple people i met at the show who also trained there. friend from washington flew to watch my show, and a few family members also came by. at this point i was happy and was ok with it being over now that i was enjoying everyones company. after eating and talking for awhile, i see the time and think its almost time to get ready for finals. we head back in, i head back stage only to see like 30-50+ girls still waiting for stage. uh oh, shows running behind. happens. i hang out with my buddies back stage, we chat and pose, and finally get to enter the pump up area and get ready. get news that theyre cutting out music routine from 60 to 30 seconds. ok well, there goes all that practice and choreography. wife was pissed cuz she said she had to sit there and watch me practice over and over all for it to be tossed lmao. im ok with it because that cuts all of our wait time in half. food and water coming closer. as we are chilling back stage, i decide to check my conditioning. i look at my legs and realize im not as dry. kinda confused, until it hits me. id been standing the whole time. unlike all the other smart people who had been sitting/laying with elevated legs, i had accumulated water. i get down but its too late at this point. finally get our time, they call us up for true novice and i win. they send out the A class winner for comparison and finally, they give us quarter turns. i didnt really get a look at the guy so i didnt know how close it would be. they send us off to the side after posing finishes, and i get called for the overall winner. dont even get to leave the stage because they send out my buddy who won class A novice for our overall comparison. now, when i turned around after winning true novice overall and saw him waiting to come out, i realized i had already lost. he had beat me in the open (without us even being compared directly) so i cant beat him now. it would be a judging discrepancy. no quarter turns, straight into poses. i still felt really good about my posing and honestly felt good standing up against him. however as we are hitting our last pose, i see one of the main judges lean over to the head judge and tell him something and holds a paper up to him. they both look at it and nod and idk what they said, but in my head it was confirmation that they looked at our scores from open and that meant i couldnt win. did i deserve to win? no i dont think so, i think he had me but it was close and i think i wouldve felt better about it had i not done open so we would have only a first and true comparison for that overall. sure enough, i lose that overall which i am ok with cuz hes a great dude. head off stage, they tell me i dont have to stick around cuz im not top 5 for open and i grab my medals and trophy, am nothing but smiles, and excitedly wish my buddy good luck for his class D and that im out of here heading straight for cheesecake factory and would see him there!

**Post Show/Sunday:** the moment i got back stage to leave, the first text i send is to my wife with 1 word: water. im so dehydrated. i find everyone, we head out. i grab some water, say bye to those not joining us for food, and head to cheesecake. get a table for 6, which is about a 30-45 minute wait. at this point, im not even hungry or looking forward to all the food. i was just happy to be with my friends and family chatting and getting to drink water. we get seated, but only 3/6 of us is there because 1 had to move his car and my wife had to drop off my BIL/pick up our daughter. i drank mine, my wifes, my daughters, and my absent friends waters. we got some appetizers, and then i went straight for cheesecake. only 2 slices, plus a strawberry shortcake with ice cream. honestly, i was pretty full from the water and that was what i cared about more. we spent about 3.5 hours at that table talking and eating (sorry waiter/waitress but we tipped well) and finally when we called it a night, i was still kinda craving either pizza or a burger. unfortunately the place immediately next to us was closed, so we head back to the room. my wife and daughter pass out and im still awake from the adrenaline. im just sitting in a chair reliving the day, and decide to head downstairs where i grab a burger before bed. the following morning i wake up, and take a nice walk downtown to dunkin donuts (never had em before) and just enjoyed the crisp morning air while still feeling a little surreal about everything. i grab 2 dozen donuts and 25 munchkins head back to the hotel, and finally get my first shower since friday morning. i really miss the tan. 


**Post Show/Off-season:** so after a few good eats sunday, this is where i have a choice to make which i already knew which path id go down honestly. proper post show rebound, or gain all of your fat back immediately eating like an asshole. i went with #2. i really wanted to normalize my fat levels and most importantly, remove the binging. removing the binging was really easy. once you no longer have restriction, there was no reason for me to binge. step 2 was to stop being so food focused. this took about 7 days post show of just eating anything i wanted, but i was slowly pulling back the ever consuming thoughts of what food i was going to eat and when. week 2 was a little less crazy, but still pretty much free eating. still hadnt done any meal prep. during these 2 weeks, i made another mistake that i had to start paying attention to. i didnt taper anything post show, so water retention became a serious issue. i had to start sleeping with my legs elevated, sometimes id have to elevate them mid day. my PEAK weight was right before bed, weighing 230. id never gone over 224lbs on the scale before. currently, i was getting back to normal dieting until now im having the same issue from earlier in prep with my jaw on the other side. so doing what i can but its been a pretty big mess. training was going back normally as well until this week where im stuck at home due to most likely having covid (better now than in prep). morning weigh is hovering around 220lbs, would personally like to see that down a little but its not my major focus right now. current anabolics is 35mg trest/wk, no other ancillaries/peptides this moment. the main focus right now is to just get health more in check, small break mentally and physically, and then begin an escalation of everything. next competition? who knows, but i definitely have plans to do another one. if not in a year, early 2023. the final 3 weeks of prep made me feel like id never wanna do one again, but post show looking back i want to get on stage ASAP. looking tan and hyper lean is amazing lol. and now that i know what to expect, i think the next one will go much smoother. now onto the most important part of this write up.

**Miscellaneous**

I got bloodwork done 10 days out and it was shockingly not that bad, and on the better side of bloods ive had in the past. 

[Dexa scan 10 days out](https://imgur.com/a/eJD14df)

6% Bf seems interesting. the lean tissue loss im not entirely concerned about, i seemed to have trended my fat loss just about on target if i had not messed up with the binging. all in all, cool info. 

Sleep was really messed up the first two weeks. the rapid weight gain gave me severe apnea, but as my body has gotten used to the weight the apnea has gotten better but still needs to be addressed. 

Mentally im in a much better place minus getting used to looking fat and bloated. its tough looking at people stage ready/tanned up and remembering how awesome i looked and reminding myself i cant go back to dieting. at the same time, my wife is happy i can eat with her again so im enjoying life very much minus the whole covid and tooth/jaw thing. 

********

**Lessons Learned and Moving Forward:**

Training: i dont think i did much wrong at all and had maintained most of my strength most of prep. very happy with how that turned out

Diet: i think im ok besides the obvious stuff. learned how important and useful of a tool refeeds can be, now to just make them more clean foods. i think part of my problem with the dieting was more related to other areas ill touch on. food selection and other choices i think went well, obvious need to tweak peak week foods but that goes back to the obvious stuff about binging and buying food i shouldnt be.

Cardio: i probably could have been a bit more aggressive with this earlier, however i think it was mostly fine. in the future i might be doing some more mixed HIIT/LISS early on, i think having so much cardio + steps was too fatiguing though. i think in the future, less steps, more cardio would be the more ideal move. 

AAS: i think var was unnecessary, i think the other choices were all spot on and probably exactly what i want to use in the future. higher test titrating down, mast moving up and being the main driver, tren low dose background maaaaybee titrating up all works wonderfully with 0 issues. the look worked great. proviron + winny was a wonder combo and honestly, complete staples to me now. i think most of my choices here were good, and that the var was the only thing i think was just not needed in any way. if i were to test anything in the future, it would be using anadrol or sdrol to fill out but have to be concerned about weight cap. halo as a hardener/finisher i just dont think is necessary. 

Thermogenics/Peptides/Ancillaries: this is where i think i made the most mistakes and have learned a lot about what to change for next time. for starters, GH will be ran longer. the recovery aspect of it is just too important to drop so early in prep like i did. i ran clen pretty high there at the end which was to make up for a shit diet which is a big no no. in the future, ill continue to use clen but at lower dosages, and possibly not even take breaks while on it. the #1 biggest mistake i made and wont make again is not using T3. i think i wouldve had a better time dieting at the end had i used T3. 25 titrating up to 50mcg will be my dosage for next prep. so next time, less clen, more GH, use T3. i should also have metformin in play at that time and have that going as well. the modafinil helped a lot and will probably keep that, the come off was not very fun. all in all, learned absurd amounts here and am excited to try it out in the future.

Post Show Rebound: I was perfectly ok accepting the huge fat gain this time, but for next time i will be much more controlled. its out of my system, i did the one mistake everyone tells you not to and i was ok with it. but yea, its a bad idea haha

Moving Forward: Health intact, and being a proper push up to around 230lbs where i probably wont go past. next show i hope to be coming in around the low 190s so i can properly run through my planned peaking protocol. 

Peaking Protocol: Since im sure people are curious, it typically will look like this. Base water 1.5 gallons, high sodium for at least 1-2 weeks prior to peak week. Sun/Mon can either be base diet, or lower carb higher fat. anywhere between slight deficit to slight surplus (+-200 cals). Tues/Weds carbs move up (individual based, using my number) to 400g each day, fat goes low, protein drops slightly. Thursday back to base diet. Friday: remove all added sodium, increase water intake to 2+ gallons. sodium cut off 3-5 hours before bed, water shuts off at bed time. i found dyazide to work perfectly fine and safely, so for me i would use 1/4 to 1/2 a tab of dyazide. saturday monitor water intake, feel free to add carbs/sodium fat back in without causing bloat. 

All in all, its been a wild ride. people at the gym were telling me how huge i look, and how its hilarious how different i am in the gym again. they mentioned that im no longer a zombie, as im not dragging slowly around the gym or just lying on random pieces of equipment anymore. 

Thank you everyone for your support and for reading along this whole time. happy to finally close this chapter, but looking forward to the next. as always if you have any questions, feel free to ask! if not, until next time!",2021-12-07 19:44:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rb7ovg/contest_prep_bodybuilding_show_final_4_weeks_post/
qnvejw,weightroom,[Program Review] Bullmastiff,"Hey folks! As some of you may be aware, I spent the last 18 weeks running Alexander Bromley’s “Bullmastiff” program, from the book Base Strength. Here’s my review.  

**Brief Summary**

Unbelievably good. Progress beyond what I had dared hope for. Bench in particular exploded, program was a constant challenge but never more than I could take. Would recommend to pretty much anyone.  

**Background**  

As before, mostly private. Worked a very physical career for a bit. Have always been pretty active; rugby (front row master race), swimming, hockey, Greco, a little undisciplined brawling masquerading as MMA, BJJ, competed at a few Highland Games, HEMA, and a few go-rounds in rodeos. I like doing dumb things. This has frequently gotten me injured.  

Nowadays, my main hobby sport is BJJ.   

Obviously, right before running this program, we had a pandemic! I was mostly out for about a year and a half, though as some may remember I did a heavy version of Dan John's 10k Swing Challenge at home. About 2 weeks after that, I decided that getting hit by a moped and going down a flight of stairs would be a fun lifestyle choice, which left me recovering from an injured back. Ran this program straight after recovery.  

**Results**  

*Lifts*  

Bear in mind the starting lifts were lower due to the long layoff and injury.  

- Squat: 395x1 -> 415x7. Squat saw great progress, but not as impressive as bench. Incredibly happy with the improvements here, but it suffered due to my own choices. Guarantee if I'd done things slightly differently, I'd have seen a bigger jump.  
- Bench: 295x1 -> 345x7. Good GOD my bench jumped up a notch. Otherworldly progress. Just...I'm speechless. Couldn't believe how easily and smoothly things went.  
- Deadlift: 535x1 -> 545x7. Right. This is **definitely** underselling things, and I guarantee that I can get more out of this. Like squat, I screwed things up here and didn't get everything I could have out of the program. I'll explain below.  
- Press: 215x1 -> 235x6. Like bench, this was a really stunning PR for me. I'd been at a bit of a stall in my pressing, and this was exactly what was needed to kick things up a bit.  

*Body*  

I got quite a bit more jacked - shoulders, arms and chest got substantially larger. Legs and back definitely saw some growth, but it wasn't quite as pronounced.  

Got a bit leaner too. Very happy all round.  

Sitting at about 250?  

*Other*  

Conditioning has my gas tank improved for stuff like BJJ - it takes a lot more to wreck me.  

I am ""terrifyingly strong"" to roll against, according to some training partners. One person exclaimed with dismay that ""one of [my] arms is stronger than [his] entire body"" when he completely failed to armbar me.  

I can lift someone about my size from passed out on the floor to over my shoulders, and carry them for a mile and a half. Work parties are fun.   

I can snap a pig spine into chunks with my bare hands.  

**Running the Program**  

*Lifting*  

Obviously, this is from a book, so I'm not gonna give away everything. The basic format is a base phase and a peak phase, each 3x3wk.  

The base phase uses a waved progression, building up for 3 weeks then resetting. The weight jumps for the main movement each week are based on an AMRAP set. For the secondary movement, the weight doesn't change each week, but sets get added. Accessory work follows a similar 'volumizing' approach, and is consistently fairly high rep.  

The peak phase does things differently - sets get dropped each week as the weight increases, though the AMRAP still controls weight jumps. Each wave in both base and peak has higher weight, lower reps - obviously.  

Each workout took me between 60 and 90 minutes. I added some stretching and ab work when I started having issues with tight hips. Other than that I ran the program **exactly** as written, no deviations or substitutions.  

*Conditioning*  

Can't skip conditioning. This isn't programmed, but you just gotta. I was training BJJ 3-4x pw during this program, frequently right after a morning workout - I'd lift, then jump straight into a class. That would sometimes serve as my conditioning. On other days I'd take stuff from /u/mythicalstrength's bad idea book, or come up with my own idiocy. It worked pretty well.   

*Diet*  

Not really regulated for most of the time. I had a vague idea that I should eat healthily, but didn't actually stick rigidly to anything. I like to cook and eat, so my meals were inventive. I always buy and eat good-quality meat from a sustainable, ethical farm and butcher anyway, so that wasn't an issue. I ate a lot of offal - organ meat is cheap, tasty and nutritious.  

My big breakthrough in terms of diet was ""more is good."" More below.  

Other things I did...I don't bother with pre-workout. Only supplements I used were Vitamin D in the morning & ZMA at night. Pre-lifting I'd usually have a cup of coffee.  

I also drink a blend of spinach, asparagus, celery, ginger, chillies, blueberries and green tea each day. It tastes foul, looks foul, has a foul texture. Really good for me though.  

I started having a prairie oyster to start every Saturday. Not sure why. It's just a thing.  

**What I Liked**  

99% of the entire program. There was *one* thing I would change that is actually a core part of the program rather than my own choice. The exercise selection is pretty damn fantastic, the progression makes perfect sense, and the structure is such that I was *always* challenged, but never quite failing. Don't get me wrong, I would hit 4/5 sets of squats and would seriously question how badly I wanted to keep going, but I was always juuuuust on the side of ""tough it out, you can do this.""  

**What Would I Change**  

- The one big thing I'd change that is actually a part of the program is one exercise. I hope it's not giving too much away, but the main variation provided for deadlifts was SLDLs. Now, I love SLDLs to get stronger generally - I'm convinced they're the best gym exercise for lifting odd objects - but they need to be heavy. Doing them for higher reps as prescribed just didn't do much for me - I would rather have used RDLs. I feel that they'd have strengthened my hamstrings more.  **EDIT - I no longer feel this way. In hindsight, this had more to do with me going too light on SLDLs for this volume.**     
- I guess I'd probably do more ab work? I feel like it would have helped.  
- I'd probably adjust my training max between base and peak phase, but only for squats and deads. Bench and press responded really well to the higher volume, but I feel that for squats and deads I could have used more quality sets actually shifting heavier weight. I know I got to the end of the peak phase and squats were really heavy on my back - would have been good to get more practice with that.  

**What I Learned (Re-Learned)**  

- I need to learn to stick to one bloody squat form and remember what it is.  
- I need to eat more. I had two weeks at the end of the peak phase that felt like death, but things immediately improved once I pretty much doubled my food intake. I look leaner and fitter than I did when I was clearly not eating enough, and my lifts were fine. It's weird - I've always had more issues *restricting* my intake than anything else, so to have the solution to looking leaner and curing my funk being ""oh, just eat a pound of beef for breakfast"" almost felt too good to be true.  
- I need to stretch my hips and I need to do abs consistently. My hips were suuuuuper tight and it was messing with my posture.  
- There's a lot of ways to be strong, and 1rms aren't the be-all and end-all. I clicked into this mindset about halfway through the base phase, and immediately felt pressure lift off me. I'd been a bit stuck in ""low rep high weight, grrr"" for a while, and deciding ""fuck a 1rm, strong is strong"" made me feel so much better. I'm planning on sticking with that mindset for a while.   
- Things are supposed to be fun.  This was less a realisation about lifting and more general, especially regarding BJJ. It's ok for me to grapple because I want to play-wrestle like when I was a kid, without needing to focus my life on it. Its ok for me to just enjoy doing things without having to specifically train to improve weak points or achieve certain levels. Think that was just some general growing-up.  

**Conclusion**  

This program was unbelievably fantastic, Alex Bromley gets my support and money. Fantastic content, fantastic programming, could not ask for anything more.  

Now, I admit that my progress may have benefited a little from recovering muscle memory after the lay-off, but **STILL!** Jesus, this program was an absolute BEAST! I cannot recommend it highly enough. 

*What's Next?*  

More Bromley. I'm gonna go with 70s Powerlifter - a similar layout, but a little more volume and a bit more variation in lift selection. It's gonna be good!

qir0cn,weightroom,[Program Review] SBS last set RIR,"Background

I’m a 21 year old college student, 5’7/170 cm tall currently weighing around 167-169lbs. I’ve been lifting since around 16 years old, I got my first gym membership sophomore year of high school. I’m currently a senior in college so I would say I have a decent training background. However, up until my sophomore year of college, I really had no agenda in the gym. I would just mess around in the gym a few times a week and chase the pump. I was introduced to powerlifting at this time as it was becoming more and more popular especially on Instagram. My roommate was also intrigued with strength training and we began browsing Reddit for programs. We stumbled across NSuns. I inconsistently ran that for a few months and had some progress with it but the volume was just a little bit too much for me to handle so I stopped running it. Pandemic happened, then gyms opened back up and I messed around with a few programs for a couple of months, ATS 2.0 reps to failure, Calgary Barbell’s 16 week free program, and Juggernaut AI. I don’t remember why I kept switching programs and not trusting the process but I eventually settled on SBS last set RIR by Greg Nuckols, which is what this write-up will be about.

Goals

Goal was to get stronger at my current bodyweight (165-170) and become part of the 1000lb club as well as the 1/2/3/4 club which is 135 OHP, 225 bench, 315 squat, and 405 deadlift. Basically just increase my powerlifting total was the goal.

Diet (Nutrition and Supplements)

Diet wasn’t really an issue for me but I didn’t really track macros except for protein. I usually had 3 meals a day (chicken breast and white fish as the main protein source) with a snack or two (protein bars and fairlife) in between meals and a protein shake before bed (either whey or a greek yogurt shake with frozen fruit). I aimed for 150g of protein a day and I probably got there most days. During weeks 14-21, I also started taking 5g of creatine every night with my shake. Some days I had fast food, which I have a huge craving for, so whenever I did, I always consumed upwards of 1k calories and a decent amount of fats which in hindsight isn’t the best.

I also took a pre-workout for the first two blocks until I ran out of it. I still trained with caffeine in my system through Premier Protein’s cafe latte which I had before every workout.

The Program

So I ran SBS Strength Program last set RIR 5x by Greg Nuckols. The exercises I did were the 3 main competition lifts, close grip bench instead of OHP. Auxiliary lifts were high bar squats, front squats, incline bench, spoto press, RDL, and dumbbell OHP. For weeks 1-14, I followed the program to a tee. The two main compound lifts, a back exercise, and some light accessories (mainly hamstring work, arms, and shoulders). My back exercises were consistent throughout the entirety of the program. I alternated between lat pulldowns with a mag grip or a normal pulldown bar, barbell rows, cable rows, and lat pullovers. For weeks 15-21, the third block or the peaking block, I completely altered the program. Instead of training 5x a week, I only trained 3x a week with each day consisting of one of the main lifts and an accessory. The only auxiliary lifts I kept in were front squats, incline bench, and dumbbell OHP. This was because of other obligations I had being a student and whatnot. For the beginning part of the third block, I also increased the accessories and basically did full-body workouts in addition to the two main lifts. To be honest, I don’t know if this was a good idea or not but my body and fatigue levels were the same if not better than when I went 5x a week. Starting week 18, I started cutting out some of the accessory volume I was doing and focusing mainly on the big 3 because I knew I wanted to test my maxes week 21 and didn’t want to accumulate too much fatigue.

I ran last set RIR instead of reps to failure because I just didn’t like pushing to failure, I feel like that would greatly hinder recovery. I also wanted to learn how to gauge my RPE/RIR and become a smarter lifter although I did do some yolo AMRAPs throughout the program which did in fact fatigue me greatly. I've also heard that RPE/RIR training is better for strength gains and injury prevention than going to failure. (could be wrong)

The results

I took four days of rest between my last training session and max-out session. My process of working up to my max attempts was fairly basic, the bar for 6-8 reps, 5-6 reps, 3 reps, and then singles. I also treated my max attempts like a meet, taking 3 attempts on each lift. My total added up to 995, I wanted 1k, so I took 415 on deadlift after the 405 but I felt my adductors as I broke the ground, so I dropped it. If you’re wondering why I didn’t just do 415 as my last attempt it was because I wanted to lock in a 4 plate deadlift instead of the 1k total.

BW: Stayed the same \~168lbs

Squat (low bar): 295 to 365

Total: 815 to 995 (5lbs short of 1k)

Thoughts on results

My squat and deadlift made significantly more progress than my bench. My bench has pretty much plateaued as I was able to bench 205 pre-pandemic. This could’ve been due to a host of things now that I think about it as I write this up. I don’t have the broadest shoulders and upper body mass and I also had to bench on a horrible cybex bench they have in commercial gyms which are very low to the ground and the bench itself is very skinny, thus no leg drive and no stable platform for my back. The lack of accessories I did for my chest could have also been a contributing factor. I also had some hiccups with my squat. My bracing wasn’t exactly the best and I lost tightness coming out the hole resulting in some lower back extension which is not good but thankfully I didn’t get injured. I’ve been working on my bracing mechanics and hopefully, they’ve been solved. Perhaps, maybe some tempo squats or paused squats might’ve helped. My right heel would also come off the ground every so often. I squat with a decent amount of forward knee travel and combined with poor ankle mobility may have contributed to why my heels leave the ground. I don’t have horrible ankle mobility and I do use squat shoes. Deadlifts for the most part went very smoothly. I played around with my sumo stance throughout the program and found one that worked the best for me around the third block. Originally I had my toes pointed at a 45-degree angle but I changed it to about 30 degrees. I felt better quad activation and could spread the floor better that way. I also used straps for most of my pulls, versa gripps and figure 8s, I never pulled mixed and when I had heavy singles or doubles I always used double overhand hook.

Random Notes (pros/cons) and what’s next for me

* SBS last set RIR is a very good program for beginners to run, very intuitive and introduces you to RPE/RIR training while also using percentage based training. The excel sheet auto regulates itself.
* Full body workouts give you a sick pump, my quads and glutes have ballooned from all this heavy leg training.
* Make sure you dial in your form before lifting heavy, mainly for injury prevention but the amount of ego lifting I see in my campus gym is ridiculous
* I don’t have progress pictures and my physique is nothing amazing, I would like to think I have a pretty decent v-taper from all the back training but I have pretty narrow shoulders.
* My sleep and recovery were meh. The first half of the program, I was on summer break so I got very good sleep but once the semester started sleep was inconsistent. The days I had to train I usually got 5-6 hrs of sleep because I have an 8 AM class which is no bueno but I had got sufficient sleep the night after my workouts.
* The only stress I had throughout this program was school and exams. I don’t have any commitments, no girlfriend, no job, and I don’t party.
* I need to add upper body mass, especially in the chest and delts. These were the muscles that I fell in love with training when I first started in the gym but I have since heavily neglected them.
* No cons to this program, genuinely enjoyed doing it and looked forward to every training session
* For me, this program is finished and I don’t know what’s next, bodybuilding for now. Maybe I’ll run Candito’s famous 6 week, revisit Juggernaut AI, or even hire a coach to do the programming for me. If anyone wants to use me as a lab rat for their coaching, I am available. I’m also trying to learn to coach myself which many say isn’t the best idea but feel free to give your input in the comments.
* I’m still very much a beginner so feel free to critique my form, give me any pointers, and whatnot!",2021-10-30 01:23:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qir0cn/program_review_sbs_last_set_rir/

Lets get into the review of the past 4 weeks. This update may seem less technical and explanation-y and more filled about emotion and mental state. Prep, above all else, is a mental game.

**8 Weeks Out:** Tren and var were coming in and I felt like my progress was going well to this point, so i was excited. I expected good things to start happening, and was mostly right. Now, its important to understand that in these situations, some things become less important; specifically the scale. Sunday I weighed in at 200lbs. Friday and Saturday morning I was 205. Weight had climbed all week despite increased cardio, and coming back from a free eating few days the previous week so diet was cleaned up. A little worried but ultimately understood, tren (and to a lesser extent var) does that. I knew sunday morning would be my tell tale sign.

**7 Weeks Out:** I was right. Calipers came down 4mm despite gaining weight last week. Took some pics, got some natural lighting on my BDB and realized i looked better/leaner than i thought. So far (outside disneyland), happiest moment of prep, and maybe happier than disneyland. However, it was time to put the foot on the gas more. This was the beginning of the perpetual ""feeling behind."" Decided I would stack the fat burners and start really digging. Im fairly certain my avg intake was 100-150 more calories than listed as i forgot to input sundays calories. Barely missed steps that week, told myself i cant let that happen. mindset was: you need to dig harder, but the cravings are getting worse. Training wise, strength had been maintained with testing some lifts from the beginning of prep so alls well there. Cardio needed to push more, so big jump

**6 Weeks Out:** Started to worry, but still strongly motivated at the beginning of the week. Drastic weight drop, and proviron coming in. New drug to me, but expected almost nothing noticeable from it, at least right away. I was flat, really, really, flat, and have been for a bit. After talking to a good friend and bber, we decided a refeed was in order. 2 high carb days, I was in the position where im lean enough to see how this would affect me and could begin to understand peak week. I was finally below 200, weighing 198.6 from last thus morning to monday morning. Monday began the refeed, and it was glorious. Told my wife i got one, so she made me pumpkin pancakes in the morning. I filled the rest of my day junk loading and getting my fill while i could. pop tarts, rice krispies, little ice cream, lots of cereal. 550g carbs. Mon pre bed i weighed 202.2 without looking spilled over. Tues morning i weighed 200.6, obviously not spilled, not blurred, so carb day 2. One more pumpkin pancake breakfast (legit best tasting thing ive had all prep) and the rest of the day was going to be mostly clean to see how i look clean loaded. Rice filled most of the rest of my carbs this day. Tues night, I barely if at all looked spilled, and weighed 203.2 pre bed. Weds morning i was 201.2 with 0 spilling, but looking massive and lean. refeed a huge success. Thurs i hit my lowest weight all prep at 197.8. Magic. had tons of calories, lost weight this week, i was very happy with where i was at the end of the week finally averaging below 200lbs. However, looking over my timeline and my response to the fat burners, it was time to take a week off of both of them to re-sensitive before making 1 big push.

**5 Weeks Out:** With fat burners gone, i decided to bump up androgen load early with winny going in and upping cardio. this week, by far, was the worst. i had already been feeling a lot of fatigue, and at an hour of cardio my legs are just jelly. carbs were practically non-existent post meal 1 unless i couldnt stand it.  but the thing that absolutely destroyed my mental status was weight gain. now, i KNOW the scale doesnt tell the whole story, but at this point i was too fragile for it to go up this much while dieting like i was. i weighed 198.8 sunday and never got below 200 the rest of the week. i cracked one night and couldnt control myself and just ate 4 fistfuls of m&ms. i literally could hear myself telling me to stop but the body just moved automatically. had some other random things, all in all the day came out to 2850 calories. not a whole lot, still a deficit amount (or should be), but i fucked up. shook it off, carried on, but as the week progressed i felt worse and worse about my look. i was flat as fuck (which is fine, i expect to be) and just felt like my legs werent getting any leaner. this week i realized i just wont make it as far as i thought. decided to play with water loading as i usually drink not a lot, so i did 2 gallons thursday. 208lb pre bed, 201.2 fri morning. 1.5 gallons friday, 207 pre bed, 201 sat morning. baselined water to 1gallon every day from now on. took pics at my most watery and was laughing cuz it wasnt good but i expected the balloon look. gained 1lb this week. saturday morning i was listening to a podcast (invasive dieting 3dmj) and realized that i was being complacent this week and that kicked my ass into so much overdrive i had never been more determined. later i was watching insta for the local show going on, and was hit with another reality check when i saw the Class B guys. at this point in time, i no longer want to look at myself. i didnt even want to do check ins the next day. the end of this week was me pretty much hyper determined while also on the verge of mental breakdown and now putting on shirts/sweats when i go to the bathroom and actively avoiding looking at myself in the mirror.

**PICS:**

As much as i dont want to post these, here are the comparison shots:

[4 Weeks Out vs 8 Weeks Out](https://imgur.com/a/G0jAIRb)

Photos typically edited with Lightroom app -> auto button -> clarity 20 -> sharpness 50

i have better lighting and looking photos but honestly just dont care to post them as there is no point in looking great in different lighting to me if i cant look better in the same lighting as before. These will be the final photos ill be posting online til show day. anything you see on ig will probably be old shots, and i wont be updating anymore on the bodybuilding sub either. 

Lets review whats coming up the final 4 weeks, as there is a ""plan"" but nothing can be set in stone at this point. Oh and forgot to mention, the previous updates food screenshots are out the window. I almost changed my diet immediately after that, removing all carbs post meal 1 on rest days, and post meal 2 on training days for the first week and then only had planned carbs meal 1 for weeks 7-5 but protein went up.

**DIET:**

[This is the BASELINE diet](https://imgur.com/a/46DKvyf)

By that i mean that this isnt what my diet looks like EVERY day, but gives you an idea of what my day could look like if i am pushing hard. Again, this is not every day, nor is this sustainable at all, nor is it smart. I will only do this if i feel i can, otherwise i will typically add rice cakes or some other food to get calories closer to 2100. If i do eat this for a few days, i will probably do a 1 day refeed to refuel and bump up my average. the goal is to average about 2100-2200 a week. I discovered if i push off my first meal, this is pretty easy to do if i go to bed early. I can and have pushed off my first meal from getting up at 4am, training, doing cardio and steps, to eating at 10am and then stacking food til its around 7 and at that time the cravings are horrendous. Some changes you might not notice from previous: Egg yolk is gone, milk is gone, and i was having 2 light english muffins (100 cal each) but am now cutting those, chia seeds been gone, no more watermelon. No more fish (honestly kinda pricey and not worth the lack of fat) but that turkey is AMAZING. seriously, its pre-cooked, delicious as hell, filling, and amazing macros. Kinda worried its not exactly as written macro wise on the package compared to just cooking chicken breast, but doubt its that significant to worry. Ive been absolutely loving my spinach and tomato omelettes ive been making so i decided to sub in that (plus no fat from egg whites) in place of meat. Whole carton of egg whites can be decently filling. Im also going through costco sized spinach bags every like 3-4 days (spinach teeth is real and sucks tho). Almost every meal is a giant 1-2 fistfuls of spinach into a pan. Things im not tracking are my tiny amount of creamer (sugar free hazelnut), the tomatoes in the omelettes, and the little bit of sugar free ketchup i use/salsa on other meals. all in all thats not much calories so im not upset. Rice cakes (caramel or apple cinnamon) are amazing and a lifesaver. i will probably be filling a lot more carbs with them, i just need to find more as most places dont carry anything other than bland flavors. My current strategy when i get bad cravings but its too early for bed is to grab a sugar free werthers and get out the door for a walk. helps cure some sweet craving while getting steps in. During the day, hunger isnt too difficult as im filled with water all the time. Strawberry watermelon mio/sweetener works really well. No more caffeine preworkout, im just popping 200mg of modafinil at this point. 2 coffees post workout, no caffeine mid day anymore for the most part, occasional white monster. The diet moving forward will mostly suck. But if it works, itll be 100% worth it and more to me. I was supposed to refeed yesterday, but didnt because my mental status wouldnt let me think more food is the right move. Last night, i realized that i really needed it from a physiological standpoint. So today after much internal debate, i will do a 1 day clean refeed of about 400g of carbs, and then go right back to digging for a few days before moving up a little to average out again to where i should be. Like i said, from here on out there is no set in stone straightforward moves, it is going to be daily adjustments based on what i can and cant handle, and what needs to be done. 

**TRAINING:**

Boring. I decided to put movements in that i was testing early in prep to measure strength loss, and will be doing exact same movements to measure fatigue going forward. First week of prep i was incline BB pressing 245 for anywhere between 5-7 for my top set, and 185 for 13-16 as my back off. The past couple weeks, i reintroduced it and am hitting 245 for 5 and 185 for 14. I pretty much maintained all my strength. BB row was 275x8 start of prep and is still 275x8. I have maintained almost all my strength except in my legs, which have lost an ok amount in pressing but still hit 315 RDLs for 8. Higher reps have pretty much all gone tho, as even in back offs i tire much quicker now so high (15+) rep sets are mostly disappearing. This is fine, im still just getting adequate weight and stimulus and just lacking the glycogen stores to have longer sets. Drop sets/intensifiers have now disappeared, every thing is a straight set. no super sets, nothing. any tiny amount of twinge and i immediately drop the weight. Force that final rep/half rep? nope. Failure yes is fine, but going for the reps i know wont look good, no, nor will i even try to eek out the bottom half cleanly like i would before. Muscle gains are all but gone, the goal is preservation, injury prevention, and fatigue management. cant help it too much with legs as cardio is wrecking them, but thats why i just dont train them super hard now. The final week of training/end of week 2 are not set in stone yet. I MIGHT move legs to that previous saturday so they have a full week to recover rather than 5 days. i might not train at all friday before the show. however peak week training is all machines, everything 3-5 RIR, 50-70% volume, 0 weighted stretch movements (no RDLS, flyes, pullovers etc). The goal is to keep the muscle primed for nutrient uptake, not induce damage or inflammation, and fatigue management. The days training that week might look different come that time, we shall see. 

**STEPS:**

100k is the most i can do. this wont change until i taper off peak week. This is difficult but i still manage it somehow, even though my legs dont want to move. 

**CARDIO:**

We are now at 6 days 60 minutes. I might split some days, and do some on either an elliptical or assault bike to give my legs a little break. i wont lie, cardio sucks. but i just keep telling myself this is going to get you leaner and i get through it. most if not all cardio will be fasted with rauwolscine. how much more cardio im going to have to push im unsure, im trying not to think about it.

**GEAR:**

Tren: hasnt changed, has been doing its job. no plans on escalating tren. 

Mast: same as tren, but considered an escalation but dont believe its necessary

Test: no changes nor plans on changing. less variables changing, less to figure out.

Var: no changes, no plans on changing

Proviron: no changes, may bump to 100mg in the final few weeks but honestly am unsure why. I doubt itll give me any different of a look compared to just being leaner.

Winny: this came in earlier than planned, but dosage will stay the same through the rest of prep. unsure what to think of it yet tbh, joints are mostly ok but we will see in a few weeks.

Aromasin: debating when/if to use this. lowering estrogen can help me dry out, and possibly help me lose my stubborn fat areas (legs/glutes/chest, estrogen dominant areas for fat) but estrogen helps glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. kinda at a loss here, not much time to debate either.

sorry i know thats boring, but thats all there is to it at this point. the additions of proviron and winny will hopefully help me get dryer and harder closer to the show and if you need deeper understanding of why these drugs, read previous upates.

**THERMOGENICS:**

I pushed these hard the past few weeks, rather than offsetting each one weekly i combined them for 2 weeks. by the end of 2 weeks, i did notice i was losing sensitivity, so i took that off week. Now, its going to look ugly. ill be pushing both of these probably further than i should for the final couple weeks, and coming off the final 1-2 weeks. I took that off week because mapping out where i was and what was left, i needed a time for a break before 1 final push and this is where we ended up. 80mcg clen/6mg rauwolscine, possible elevation of one or both of those over the next 3 weeks. I dont really get this bad anxiety with them luckily. The off week did me well imo, as the rauwolscine feels like it should again. Time to just finish the job, and hopefully not have a heart attack, in which case well the job is finished.

[1 and 3 month look at RHR and sleep](https://imgur.com/a/q7CZse2)

The sleep can be a little funky as some days it just didnt measure all of it. Also that water load messed with me, as i was literally peeing 5-7x a night the next few nights. now im going roughly 3-4x.

**SUPPLEMENTS AND ANCILLARIES:**

Only real change was adding Taurine and NAC. helpful for reducing oxidative stress etc, nothing fancy or fun. modafinil is pretty much a staple now til end of prep. might have to up the sleep aid to a full serving going forward, as sleep has not been kind. almost to the point of cutting fish oil out for the reduced calories, but am pretty positive thats a dumb idea as the benefits outweigh the risks. 

**BLOODWORK:**

[If your expecting to see the epitome of health, im sorry.](https://imgur.com/a/H48UUki)

all in all, not upset about much here. RBCs are always elevated on me, and kinda expected right now. Ketones was interesting, guess 150-200g of carbs had me going keto? Easy to miss but the very top, TSH is normal. thats a big one. typically peoples thyroids look bad in prep, and use T3 to help (which i will in the future preps). I used tren to help stoke my thyroid along, and it apparently seemed to work. felt good about that. Lipids well, i dont think ive literally ever had a 40+ HDL. i was honestly expecting single digits. gotta clean that up post show but obviously they wont look good now. Creatinine pretty much where its been the past few years, but this was ran by my PCP not my nephro so no cystatin C. barely elevated liver values, call that a win. not too upset by these, getting bloods done in a couple weeks by my nephrologist too so i can make sure my cystatin C is still very good (praying that it is). 

**Mental Status:**

Its been tough. Yes thank you, i know you guys are hear to talk if i need to and many many people have offered, but at this point the only thing i want to do is put my head down and get in condition. I dont want to look at myself (which makes posing kinda hard, i actually have been skipping gym posing), im back to training completely covered, i keep looking at show winners and getting down, and i know im just stressing myself for no reason. My logic brain is still talking to me, its just being ignored. I have thoughts of quitting occasionally, not pulling out of the show just giving up on getting more conditioned. That wont happen i promise you, but the thoughts do come by when its hard. The brightest (and possibly only) spot in my life right now is how insanely supportive my wife has been. I doubt i could actually continue to do much without her, she stepped up way beyond for what is my passion. Words cant really express my gratitude towards her right now, but an understanding partner is worlds beyond amazing for where i am mentally right now. Shes excited for this to be over so i can go back to eating everything she doesnt want to finish, and im excited to do so. Im mostly flat emotionally all day, definitely more quick to agitation though. Libido talk so if tmi, skip ahead. My libido has been nonexistent since like 8~ weeks out. Ive had 1 boner outside of morning wood since then, and the thought of sex pretty much never crosses my mind. Im positive my dick still works, i just have literally 0 desire to use it and if im being honest, ive been totally ok with that this whole time because i would rather be hyper focused on the show. It is literally all consuming to me, morning to night, almost every single moment is me thinking of the prep and the show. obsessive? absolutely, but ive always been hyper competitive and i love this shit, so im ok with that. 

**Peak Week:**

Well obviously i cant tell you what i will be doing because im still unsure, but i do have plans in mind. 

things that wont be manipulated: water intake, most sodium intake. no crazy water changes, no crazy sodium manipulation. these things are way too balanced in the body to be worth trying to manipulate.

things that will be: carbs, protein-ish, fats, cardio, training. 

i dont plan on rapid backloading, so there wont be some crazy depletion. i think thats too risky and im not lean enough for it. the plan is either a front load with a swing day, or a mid load/mid load with a swing day. i like the idea behind the swing day, but to be honest if im just not lean enough i may end up ruining everything with a diuretic the night before. who knows. dont plan on it, but again nothing set in stone. cardio and steps will taper down, cardio completely leaving a few days pre show. i do NOT plan on doing the magical burger and fries the night before the show. imo, thats just absurd. why do something so drastically out of your control the night before a show after all your hard, controlled work? ill be carbing and sodiuming up on cleaner foods. the only thing im unsure of right now is my pre-stage meal, which needs to be very high sodium and high carb. probably something like rice cakes, PB, and honey/jelly. we shall see.

**Post Show Eats:**

Current plan is cheesecake factory after the show, cookies, and who knows after that. donuts in the morning for sure, never had dunkin and theres one across the hotel so will be trying those. its going to look real, real bad tho, so tune in on instagram and ill document it all! get to celebrate my birthday that im skipping cuz ill be like 2 weeks out, and going back to disneyland to eat everything again but more this time! 

Well thats all for this update. Thanks for coming along this wild journey with me, and thanks everyone for your support. Has meant a lot and continues to, and i will be doing my best not to disappoint you guys. i know i cant, but again as a hyper competitive person i put it on myself that everyone expects me to win so anything short is a failure (unless some freak just shows up, id be ok losing to someone i knew i could never beat but would be upset losing to someone i thought i could). I definitely feel like im leaving some stuff out, but ive been writing for 2 hours now and am behind eating my first meal. Feel free to leave any questions, comments, or concerns below but if not, i will see you guys for the final installment in 4 weeks: The Post Show review!",2021-10-25 16:24:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qfkfpb/contest_prep_4_weeks_out_from_first_bodybuilding/
q7dx8i,weightroom,Jacked & Ran - Concurrent 5/3/1 & Boston Marathon training,"**Synopsis //**

A 43-year-old guy tries to run a prestigious marathon despite being out of shape, while also trying to break a 1k total for the first time. 

**Training history //**

I came to lifting from a distance running background, taking up lifting in the spring of 2020 when covid shut down races around the world and I needed a new challenge. Started out with the [nSuns LP](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/iq47nw/program_review_nsuns_5day_lp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), then moved on to SBS RTF.  I really enjoyed both of those programs.  Had some injuries and setbacks, lost some strength, tried to get back into the swing of things. S/B/D at the start of this training block was 300/260/390 for a 950lb total.

**Boston thru the backdoor //**

The Boston Marathon sets qualifying standards that are adjusted for age and gender. However, meeting those standards isn’t enough to get in. Every year more people meet the standards than there are spots in the race. Meeting the standards just gives you the privilege to submit an application. You can “qualify” for Boston and still be denied entry. In reality, you have to be a little bit faster if you want to get in. The fastest applicants in each age group are accepted until all the spots are filled. Runners refer to this as the “cut-off” or buffer on top of the actual standards. This true cut-off varies from year to year. Most years it’s only 1-2 minutes faster. Guessing this year’s cut-off is a game that runners like to play because you need to talk about something to take your mind off the monotony of running in circles for fun.

You generally apply using a qualifying time from any marathon you did the year before. So for Boston 2021 you would submit your best time from some race in 2020. Because covid-19 cancelled all races in 2020, they made a rare exception and allowed people to submit a time from 2018 onward. This is where things got interesting for me. 

Way back in 2018 I was a 155lb skinny dude that didn’t lift and only ran. When it came time to apply for Boston in April of this year I had been lifting for about 12 months. I had bulked up to 188 lbs and had a 950 lb total. I was barely doing any running and was much *much* slower. But, according to the new rules, I was still allowed to submit a qualifying time from my skelly days. I felt kinda bad doing this. It was like making a Tinder profile using an old photo that doesn’t look anything like you. 

Instead of the typical 1-2 minute cut-off seen in most years, the cut-off for 2021 was a whopping 7 minutes and 47 seconds. The highest it’s ever been. The skinny version of me beat the standard by 9 minutes and 52 seconds, so I was in by a comfortable margin. The current version of me couldn't run more than 5 miles without stopping, let alone qualify for Boston. The pace I ran to qualify (6:52/mile \[4:15/km\]) was completely out of reach in my current state.  I might be able to hold that pace for one mile all out on a good day. I had a long road ahead of me to get into the kind of shape where I could even finish a marathon. 

I owed it to myself to not half-ass the race just because I was bigger and less focused on running than I was in the past. I wanted to put in an honest effort for both sports. I still hadn’t broken a 1k total and I really wanted to hit some long-term strength training goals. At the very least I didn’t want to lose any ground with my lifts.

**Picking a strength training plan //**

Initially, I had my eyes set on General Gainz. I messaged /u/just-another-scrub because I had seen his write-up of GG in WR. He told me it was a great program, but mentioned that 5/3/1 might be a better fit for my goals. 

I bought 5/3/1 Forever and gave it a read. I woke up naked in a grassy field with the phrase “5S PRO??” written across my chest in someone else’s blood. After recovering I decided to re-read the book along with a copy of Beyond 531, extensive Google searches and some meditative breathing. Based on recommendations from JAS I ended up going with BBB for the first training block and Pervertor for the second block.

The notion that 531 is written for athletes was appealing to me. Being able to lift 3-4 days per week was ideal for someone planning to run 4-5 days per week. I also wanted to avoid doing a full-body workout. I needed to be able to separate squat sessions from hard running sessions, as I’ve found that combo to be too much for my legs in terms of recovery. 

**Goals //**

I’m a goal-oriented person so I set some goals going into this training cycle. I set a range of goals from the reasonable to the ambitious.  

*Lifting:*

* C goal: Don’t lose any overall strength (maintain my 950lb total)
* B goal:  Finally hit a 1k total 
* A goal: Hit a 1,050lb total
* A+ goal: Become the topic of a NoJ post

*Running:*

* C goal:  Finish the race / Don’t end up in the medical tent
* B goal:  < 4:00 marathon (9:09/mile pace)
* A  goal: < 3:50 marathon (8:46/mile pace)
* A+ goal: < 3:40 marathon (8:23/mile pace)

**Strength training //**

I did two training blocks. Each block was 11 weeks long and consisted of 2 leaders (3 weeks each), 1 deload week, 1 anchor (3 weeks), and 1 PR test week. I chose to lift 4x per week. Wendler says you can run the programs 3x per week. In the back of my mind I was prepared to drop to 3x per week if it became too much, but it never came to that. All of Wendler’s programs include some conditioning work. I substituted all of that with running mileage. 

*Block one (4/26/21 - 7/18/21):*

The first block was 2 mesocycles of BBB and one mesocycle of 531 FSL. For BBB, I kept accessories to a minimum, hitting 0-25 reps of push & pull. Wendler says not to do single leg work with BBB, and I didn't need any convincing. For FSL, I did more accessories and increased the total reps into the 50-100 range.  An outline of how I structured the cycle is here.  

&#x200B;

||Monday|Tuesday|Thursday|Friday|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Main lift|Squat|Bench|Deadlift|OHP|
|Accessories|Arnold press, Meadows row, ab wheel|Dips, pull-ups, bulgarian split squats|Shrugs, Lu raises, ab wheel|BB row, incline press, single leg RDLs|

*Block one results:*

At the end of this first training block I did a PR test.  The formula Wendler uses in his book for estimated 1RM is (weight x reps x .0333 + weight), so that’s what I’ve used below, rounding down.  

&#x200B;

||Squat|Bench|Deadlift|OHP|Big 3 total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Start|300|250|390|175|950|
|End|[315x2](https://youtu.be/vCpUpbrlgF8) (e1RM 335)|[245x2](https://youtu.be/6VYqGlJgiUw) (e1RM 260)|[380x3](https://youtu.be/ujGatgHpWPA)(e1RM 415)|[165x3](https://youtu.be/v2he2r8pngk) (e1RM 180)|1010|

Finally hit the elusive 1k total, adding 60lbs to my total. Overall, I really liked BBB.  I had chest DOMS after every bench day for six straight weeks. I found 5 x 10 deadlifts to be dreadful. FSL was more sustainable, and I could see myself training that way for long periods of time. Although I got stronger, I still lowered my TM for my lifts prior to beginning the next training block based on Wendler’s recommendations. 

*Block two (7/19/21 - 10/3/21):*

The second block was 3 mesocycles of Pervertor (2 leaders/1 anchor). Pervertor is the ADHD template. The main lifts use 5S Pro. But the supplemental lifts vary from week to week. It jumps from 10x5 @ FSL to 5x10 @ FSL, then 5x5 @ SSL. The anchor was even more crazy. One week you’re doing a 1x20 widowmaker set, then the next you’re doing SSL, then FSL. He really just throws the kitchen sink at you with the hopes that something in there will elicit a response. Accessory work was similar to the previous block.

*Block two results:*

At the end of the anchor template I did another PR test.  

&#x200B;

||Squat|Bench|Deadlift|OHP|Big 3 total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Start|335|260|415|175|1010|
|End|[315x4](https://youtu.be/s29x2V9bRKY) (e1RM 355)|[245x4](https://youtu.be/vqds4fDORHk) (e1RM 275)|[385x3](https://youtu.be/a0qOdizaKTg)(e1RM 420)|[170x3](https://youtu.be/ZGDBbBP82t8) (e1RM 185)|1050|

This block ended exactly one week before race day.  It was risky to do a PR test for the big 3 this close to the race, as I could have tweaked something, but curiosity got the best of me. During that one week window between wrapping up 5/3/1 and race day I did zero lifting.  

**Running training //**

My most recent big race was the Houston half marathon in 2019 where I ran a 1:24 (6:24/mile \[3:58/km\]). Again, that was back before I was lifting. In the interim I lost a metric shit ton of fitness and gained 33 lbs of bodyweight. 

I do my own programming for running, so I came up with a comeback plan that would work alongside 5/3/1. I ran 4-5 days a week while lifting 4 days a week. Running consisted of one hard workout per week, one long run and the rest was just easy runs. Early on in the cycle my easy pace was in the 9:45/mile range, but by the end I was doing long runs at 8:15/mile pace. I used to do long runs at 7:15/mile pace while holding a conversation with teammates, but those days are long gone.

On days where I ran and lifted I didn't do them back to back unless life circumstances required it. Typically, I would do one in the morning before work, and the second one in the evening after work, with about 10 hours in between. I found this to be sufficient recovery time. The overall layout looked like this:

&#x200B;

||Sun|Mon|Tues|Wed|Thurs|Fri|Sat|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Lift|Rest|Squat|Bench|Rest|Deadlift|OHP|Rest|
|Run|Easy 4-5 miles|Rest|Hard 6-7 miles|Easy 4-5 miles|Rest|Easy 4-5 miles|16 mile long run|

This generally came out to 35 miles per week give or take. Historically I like to average 60-75 mpw when doing a marathon, so this was a 50% reduction in training volume to make up for all the lifting.

I strained my calf about 5 weeks out from race day. It would seize up on me on occasion and was moderately uncomfortable when going up a flight of stairs. Rather than take time off, I used a combination of ibuprofen, heat and compression wraps. I dialed back the intensity of some runs but kept the overall volume the same. By the time race day rolled around it was 80% better.

I tapered down my mileage the last 10 days prior to the race. I usually do a tune-up 10k race a few weeks prior to the marathon to see where things stand in terms of aerobic fitness. It helps me gauge how the training block is going and gets me into the mental mindset of racing. I didn’t do it this time because racing in the summer is terrible and I wasn’t going into this marathon shooting for a PR. 

**Diet //**

I’ve always done intuitive eating, letting my training dictate my caloric intake. I kept a mental tally of my protein macros, but otherwise used my bodyweight, energy levels and performance as a metric of whether I was eating enough. My wife and daughter are both vegetarians, so family meals are generally meat-free. I would personally still eat meat if we went out for dinner. 

Breakfast was the only meal where I ate the same thing everyday: overnight oats with a scoop of unflavored whey protein and 5g of creatine. Otherwise, meals were highly varied as my wife and I both like to cook. I’m natural and have never taken PEDs. The only supplements I take are fish oil and creatine. I made it a goal to get 8 hours of sleep and averaged closer to 9 hour per night.

My highest caloric intake was on long run day. Before every long run I had 2 Pop-tarts for breakfast (400 calories). It was an easy-to-digest sugar rush and their s’mores flavor is divine.  Immediately after the long run I’d drink two 20oz Gatorades (280 calories).  Then I’d hit the shower and stop at In-n-Out to get 2 double double cheeseburgers and an order of fries for lunch (1,710 calories). In the evening I’d eat dinner with the family and then go out for dessert and get a large turtle sundae (1,027 calories). That generally put me in the 4,200 calorie range for the day. The rest of the week was more scaled back with closer to 3,500 calories.  My body weight at the start of the training block was [188lbs](https://imgur.com/SuZGXf8) and it ended at [199lbs](https://imgur.com/Mla59h6).

**Race day //** 

The Boston marathon finish line is in Boston, but the start line is 26.2 miles away in a small town called Hopkinton, MA. You wake up at the crack of dawn, get on a bus at Boston Commons, and they ship you off.  You spend the long bus ride thinking wow this is really far away and why did I pay so much money to do this to myself. They drop you off at the start line with a few thousand other runners and line you up in the order of your qualifying time, with the fastest people in the front and slowest in the back. So I was surrounded by people who were planning on running significantly faster than I was. Presumably many of these people have continued to train hard and have gotten even faster in the 1-2 year interim between their qualifying race and today. Unfortunately, I had done the exact opposite. I had to prepare myself mentally that I was going to get passed right from the start and would continue to be passed for the entire race. It’s very easy to get caught up in the crowd and adrenaline rush only to find yourself falling apart by mile 16 because you went out too fast. I had to put my ego aside and run my own race.

Conditions were not ideal with temps around 65F/18C and 90% humidity, but you deal with whatever the day gives you. The course is predominantly downhill for the first half followed by some poorly placed uphills from mile 16-22. I cross the start line and took the first 5k in 23:27 (7:33/mi pace). Much faster than I had intended but adrenaline is a helluva drug and I'm bad at taking my own advice. I’m running by myself without a pack to latch onto because there’s no one around doing my pace. Despite telling myself I’m going too fast I feel ok aerobically so I just keep rolling with it, hitting the 13.1 halfway mark in 1:41:26 (7:44/mi pace). Still too fast, but the energy from the crowds is pretty wild and I felt ok. I hit the uphill section and things get real hard real fast. I’m drinking water and taking energy gels regularly to keep the engine going. I survived the uphills and hit the 24 mile / 40k mark. At this point my pace has only dipped down to 8:20/mi despite everything which is still faster than my goal pace. All of sudden, everything starts cramping up. Hamstrings and calves seize up and I know if I push any harder I’ll end up limping my way to the finish line. Only 2 miles to go and everything is shutting down. I had come too far and put too much into this training cycle to be brought down by a rogue hamstring. My pace had suddenly dropped to 9:58/mi pace and I’m in a world of hurt. I see the sign that says 1 mile to go and manage to dig deep taking that last mile at 7:30/mi pace. Official finish time: **3:29:44**.

**Wrap-up //**

* I added 100 lbs to my total and 11 lbs of bodyweight. While not amazing for 22 weeks of training, I’m looking at it in the context of trying to balance it with marathon training, so overall I’m still very happy with the results. 
* There’s a lot of misconception about 5/3/1. People say it’s low volume. That’s blatantly false. Sessions would take me 90-120 minutes depending on the template. I enjoyed these templates and plan to run them again in the future. It works perfectly along side athletic endeavors. 
* The TM is just a starting point for the program progression and its relation to 1RM doesn't really matter. Having the word ""max"" in the name makes you think it has some correlation with your 1RM. I lowered my TM between my first and second training block and still ended up adding an additional 40lbs to my total. 
* I beat my A+ running goal by over 10 minutes on a hard humid course. 
* Compared to my personal best, my overall marathon pace only dropped by about one minute per mile despite doing 50% less training and weighing 45lb more. I still don’t know how I did that.
* Marathon training while also trying to improve your lifts can be done. But, I’ll be honest, it’s still very *very* difficult. Waking up early to workout is easy. Coming home from work and doing it again sucks. All that being said, half-marathon training is less miserable and I think that could be more easily balanced with lifting. It would still require a fair amount of dedication.

**Up next //**

At the end of the day my lifts still suck. Thinking back to the post by /u/The_Fatalist on why you should stop qualifying your results, it would be easy for me to say my lifts aren’t not bad for a distance runner in his mid-forties with only 18 months of strength training under his belt. But I’m not going to do that. I’m going to keep at it and see how high I can take these lifts. I’m going to try Deep Water for beginners because /u/MythicalStrength has spoken so highly of it.

Boston is my marathon swan song. I’m going to stick to the half marathon from now on. I’m running the Houston half marathon in January with some friends. We’ll see if Deep Water and half-marathon training go well together or if I will regret that decision. After Deep Water I’m going to run Simple Jack’d.

If I ever get my lifts out of poverty range I may even do a powerlifting meet someday just for the experience. I don’t know if I’m going to keep trying to balance running and lifting, or if I’m just going to hang up my racing shoes, bulk to 242 and become a meat fridge. Next summer when it’s blazing hot in my garage gym I might join a gym and run one of Meadow’s bodybuilding programs just to put some meat on these bones.

**Gratitude //**

First and foremost, I have to thank /u/just-another-scrub. He was an invaluable resource and an all around stand-up dude. The guy should ghostwrite the next edition of Wendler’s book. 

Although he’s probably not reading this, I have to thank Spengler. He’s never spoken to me directly, but his work left a lasting impression on me. I started out in /r/fitness asking dumb questions in the daily and reading the goddamn wiki. I would not be here today without him.

Also a big thanks to all the mods and regulars on WR.  Posting here is anxiety-inducing because y’all are strong af and way more knowledgeable about this stuff than I am. It's highly motivating seeing the folks on this sub doing impressive stuff all time. This entire post is really just the B-movie version of  /u/DadliftsnRuns deadlift & mile run post. Everyone has been super supportive and I learn new stuff all the time.

[Before and after pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/1qfkqUg) Too be honest these aren't the best pictures to represent this. I was never going for looking bigger, just being stronger. I never thought to take a proper before/after picture because of this. So, yeah this is as close as it's going to get!

**The template I followed after 531 BBB (I call it 531 x 365, with actual credit of the title coming from** u/3pIcenTer\*\*):\*\*

531 has so many templates and I’m stubborn. So I made up my own. It’s very basic and anyone with a basic understanding of 531 programming should get the idea of it. Without going into it too much, 531 usually has 3 main sets followed by 5 supplemental sets. Not always, but that’s the pattern that most templates follow.

I wanted something that mimicked a cycle of volume, followed by a cycle of intensity, and worked up to a yearend total. (Approximately a year, a little less than that) So I present to you the 531 template that you can run for almost an entire year. Once it’s over, retest your maxes, enter a new TM (if it’s lower than the current, always use the lower number) and then repeat over and over until you die.

I call it 531 x 365. (Get it, because you can do it all year) I used a 90% TM, but if I were to repeat it I would probably use a 85%. Maybe even an 80%.

**How it works:**

Supplemental work changes every cycle, main work follows traditional 531 programming. Supplemental work is always based off of the increased TM. I chose to increase all of my TM’s by 5 pounds except for my OHP which I increased by 2.5 pounds a cycle.

**Cycle 1: Volume**

4 day split, OHP, Squat, Bench, Deads each having their own day. Preferably rest day after two days on, then 2 more days on, then 2 rest days. Works great as a Monday, Tuesday, off on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, off on the weekend schedule. Do what you have to do though.

Cycle 1 focuses on volume for the supplemental work. Do your 3 main sets and then your supplemental sets will look like this.

* 5 sets of 12 reps of 45% of your TM. Repeat this same weight for the entire cycle for your supplemental work.

**Cycle 2: Intensity**

Supplemental work done as:

* 5 sets of 6 of 75% of your TM

**Cycle 3: Volume**

* 5 sets of 11 at 50% of your TM

**Cycle 4: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 5 at 80% of your TM

**Cycle 5: Volume**

* 5 sets of 10 at 55% of your TM

**Cycle 6: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 4 at 85% of your TM

**Cycle 7: Volume**

* 5 sets of 9 at 60% of your TM

**Cycle 8: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 3 at 90% of your TM

**Cycle 9: Volume**

* 5 sets of 8 at 65% of your TM

**Cycle 10: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 2 at 95% of your TM

**Cycle 11: Volume**

* 5 sets of 7 at 70% of your TM

**Cycle 12: Test Maxes or Do TM test, adjust to the lower TM and start over from the beginning.**

By lower TM I mean the following:

You start with a TM of 200 on bench press. After 12 cycles your TM is now 260. When you test your maxes you find out that your actual max for bench is actually 260. Using the 90% TM means the new TM you would use is now 235.

In a different example, you started with a 200 pound TM on bench, but when you test your new max you actually bench 300. This would suggest that your new TM should be 270, but stick with the 260.

Stick with the lower number and you’ll have less chances of getting stuck. What do you do if you get stuck? Follow normal 531 protocol. I never stalled on this programming.

**Accessories:**

Do what 531 programming suggest or do your own thing. I did my own thing and had great success with it.

I reached my strongest point by doing the following for accessories.

1. Find a TM for your accessory just like you would a main lift. Either max out or find a top set of 3-5 where you couldn’t do more reps. Then take a 90% of that to get a TM.
2. Take your TM and take 70% of that and 50% of that.
3. Do 3 sets at 70% of your TM like this: 5, 5, 5+
4. Do 2 sets at 50% of your TM like this: 10, 10
5. Keep the same weight for the entire cycle and just try to beat your + set
6. If you could get all of the minimal reps on all 5 sets (at least 5 on the 3rd set) then increase the weight by the smallest amount possible. If it’s a machine that goes up by 2.5 pounds then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a bar that you can put 2.5’s on either side then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a machine that you can add 10 pounds to as the minimal number then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If you can’t complete the reps then either lower the weight or repeat the weight next cycle.

**My bench day accessories:**

* Row, lateral raises, close grip bench (giant superset thingy)

**OHP day:**

* Weighted dips, Chest flys/superset with reverse flys, rows

**Deadlift day:**

* Lat Pulldowns, shrugs, leg extensions superset with leg curls

**Squat day:**

* Split squats, weighted back extensions, lat pulldowns

Ab rollouts or hanging leg raises every day. If I had extra time I would do a facepull/tricep superset with the ropes or a curl/forearm curl superset.

Some kind of conditioning every workout and on most rest days.

My accessories often changed if I got bored or wanted to train for a specific event, but for the most part I would keep them the same so I could track progress. Sometimes I would do cleans with an axle bar or regular bar after a squat or deadlift workout. Sometimes I’d do incline bench press instead of close grip bench. Sometimes I would do leg press, hack squats, or smith machine squats instead of leg extensions or split squats on one of my lower body days.

**Conditioning:**

Usually done every day. I would often rest on the weekend and not do too much. Conditioning always changed based on the current needs. If I had nothing to prep for it was just sled pushes/pulls, jogging, sprinting, and bike.

If I was prepping for a comp it was usually comp specific. High volume lift representing the strongman event. Tire flips, vehicle pushing, sled pushing, power cleans, carrying stuff, etc…

**Other:**

Every other week or so I would skip my Wednesday rest day and take Friday off so I could train strongman events on Saturday.

**Diet:**

I usually ate quite a bit. Between 3,500 – 4,000 calories for the most part unless I was cutting weight. I often cut shortly after comps because I liked to drop 5-10 pounds and then bulk up into my next competition. Felt like I was stronger if I was gaining weight so I never went into a competition dropping body weight. It has worked pretty well. I’ve brought home some cool strongman trophies!

I just tried to eat around 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. I ate like every 3 hours because sometimes I would get caught up and not eat enough to go along with my training.

Supplements? Just some caffeine and creatine. Fish oil.  Mostly pizza.

**Findings:**

The first week of the new cycle was always a killer. Week 2 was much better and by week 3 the supplemental work felt like I was throwing it around. It wasn’t uncommon that I had to rest for the last set or two of the supplemental work on week 1. Maybe on OHP I would have to Push Press most of the last set. Deads turned into touch and go’s, etc…

Other than that I really liked it. I would almost get nervous/excited for a new cycle and I really liked knowing exactly what I was working towards for almost the entire year.

At first I was able to push the + sets early on. As the TM’s got heavier and heavier I was doing 5 pro’s more often. I think if I would have picked the lower TM this wouldn’t have been an issue and the next time I run this that’s the plan.

**Random notes:**

I love doing the supplemental work as a variation of the main work. The important thing is to use the appropriate TM for the different work. I don’t suggest basing it off of the TM of your main work.

For the most part I would pause my main bench sets, but do touch and go’s on the supplemental.

Trap bar the main deadlifts (if I was preparing for a car deadlift) and conventional deadlifting the supplemental.

Using front squats or SSB squats as the main work and doing the supplemental as back squats.

Using the log or axle every now and then on OHP, etc…

**What’s next?**

I’m going to challenge myself in the next weight class in strongman. I’m going to follow BBBeefcake, BTM, and deep water. The goal is to gain 20 pounds, then follow it up with 12 weeks of other programming while I cut 10 of those pounds back off. Repeat for another 20 pound gain and then another 10 pound cut. That will put me right around 225 body weight, a nice place to be when competing in the 231 weight class as I can go into comps gaining weight like I usually do. Maybe I get fluffy. Maybe I look buff. At the end of the day I don’t care too much as long as I get stronger.

pwk459,weightroom,[Contest Prep] 8 Weeks Out From First Bodybuilding Show Update,"[Follow along on instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/geekgenetics/) [GeekGenetics](https://www.instagram.com/geekgenetics/)

Good morning everyone and welcome back to another installment of my prep log! Things are going to be turning up a notch from here on out! Lets review the previous 4 weeks first!

[12 week update if you missed it!^[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pepj6f/contest_prep_12_weeks_out_from_first_bodybuilding/)

**12 weeks out:** cardio got introduced as i felt it was the time to start that moving. started low and slow just  to try to get used to it again. steps stayed pretty solid, bf didnt take a huge drop tho. weight this week was a roller coaster, thank god for daily weigh ins to average it out

**11 weeks out:** final week of GH, was happy to not have to pin more things. steps came down slightly, cardio went a bit faster. decided to elevate the clen this week to combat the tolerance i build after 1 week. this was a better fat loss week, calories stayed somewhat high and hunger wasnt so bad but i started to get concerned i wasnt going to make it. weight trended down the whole week

**10 weeks out:** another solid fat loss week (thank you clen), decided to bump up cardio another day as 3 days was just not enough. GH out, mast in had me feeling like i was moving towards the home stretch. decided to change clen protocol to 1 week on/off, and would utilize alpha-yohimbine during the off week. 6mg on non training days with fasted walking and cardio, 3mg on training days fasted. felt confident this was a good decision, but hunger has started to rise quickly but felt extra motivated with the changes in protocols feeling like the right decision. One thing that sucked was sunday morning i found out my watch had broke (fitbit battery died completely). i was honestly super stressed about it, it was my most important tracking tool for prep. wife said lets go to costco and i got a new versa 3, stress gone thank god. 

**9 weeks out:** This is a weird week for prep, but great for me. Wife decided she wanted to take a trip to disneyland, so T-TH we were there. it was blazing hot, but tons of fun. decided i was going to do my first and only diet break of prep. i pretty much was free eating and tried to hold back what i could but was rather difficult at that point. still did my fasted cardio while up there, still trained legs while i was up there. breakfast was like 6 rice cakes and 2 yogurts, i had also packed a ton of chicken. if i was having a meal not made by disney, it was chicken and veggies (probably about 6~ meals in total while i was up there). otherwise, it was almost a whole pizza, a lot of ice cream (crazy shake was amazing, salt and straw is divine), tons of pumpkin spice lattes, some other dinner in disneyland, a couple bites of a corndog and some churros, cookies/sweets and other deliciousness. was all delicious, and the food made me insanely vascular, never had that many spider web veins on my abs in my life. on the drive home, my wife talked to me about how excited she was for my show and she was ready to really help me stay hard on my diet and that she wants me to really succeed and be as lean as i can. it was great hearing that after all that binging and i think the mental break for both me and my wife this prep really helped relax and get ready to buckle down. steps were very high, cardio was bumped up, weight still trended down, and bf measurement still came back lower. all in all, a success.

On to the important stuff:

Now on to the plan for the following 4 weeks!

**CALORIES:**

[Current PLANNED diet for 8-7 and 6-5 weeks out](https://imgur.com/a/jM2omis)

The reason i am highlighting that this is the PLANNED diet is that i am at the point where things are subject to change more quickly. There may be more calorie drop after this week, or maybe i dont drop calories at all 6 weeks out. itll totally depend where im looking, although im fairly confident i will drop calories by 6 weeks out. Decided to find ways to drop more fat (the macro) and realized that fish is leaner than chicken. the downside is it smells fucking horrid and i dont think my wife will let me keep making the house smell like this, and we have been burning candles daily now. Moved more rice into those fish meals as they work much better with rice than other foods. Chicken meals all have a handful of coleslaw mix, and chopped lettuce (diet lettuce boy checking in) with some honey mustard. honestly, very delicious and a lot of food volume, but still leaves me hungry. Chicken seasoning has cycled from smokehouse maple (RIP, so good) to montreal chicken (still delicious). If i do take out fish, i will sub for probably 99% lean turkey or something similar. At this point, theres really not much fat im willing to part with (in the listed diet) so i will have to start debiting carbs. no refeeds planned either at the moment. on non training days, i will either remove the english muffins completely, have 1 if i want a little bit, or have both if im starving. they make 100 calorie ones that ill switch to later, as thatll keep my food volume but drop 100 cals total per day which is perfect. for now, im playing around with all the type of them. sourdough, cinnamon raisin, wheat, etc. still have ketchup, chia seeds (this is an easy cut to save 75 cals), sugar free hazelnut creamer, and so much watermelon. same caffeine intake as last time, 100mg preworkout, 1 coffee post workout, 1 white monster midday. had to make a tough decision between a 30 pack of white monsters or a 30 pack of bang, and decided my heart probably cant handle bangs right now with how much shit im taking.


**TRAINING:**

[Link to training again](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWaMYplH_v6dQZCtG7uZ1kJzmYDjsUAv0Spxav4TDGY/edit#gid=972061199)

As you can see, im still not tracking my minor muscle groups as i dont see a need. i train those just for some pumps (at least, try to get a pump) and some extra work/maintenance. major muscle groups i still try to track more closely, at the very least track a main movement. strength was starting to slowly come down, and i 100% dont have nearly as many reps in my drop sets as i used to. i gas out really quickly even if the weight drop is decently sized. slowly doing less and less finishers as i just dont think ill be able to recover completely constantly from all of this. drop sets are starting to go from 2 drops to 1 drop. all of this is done by ear, i only plan on decreasing as i feel is needed based on recovery. the closer i get to the show, the less important training becomes. 

**STEPS:**

welcome to the dig boys. this is where a major change is coming for this week, and unsure if ill maintain it moving forward. 100k steps. the workload is real. and remember, none of this is counted in my cardio sessions. im pretty much going to have to move around constantly all day to keep this up, as the goal is roughly 15k steps a day. the target here is to see just how much progress i can dig out in a week, and adjust from that. im praying i dont have to keep this up, but i will do what is needed. at least 20% of my steps will probably be me on the treadmill, so in reality im spending probably an hour+ on the treadmill a day counting cardio. the goal is to be ready a little early, and try to shed as much fatigue as i can to get to stage fresh as possible.  

**CARDIO:**

up to 5 days now, and decided to go from 20 to 30 minutes for this dig week. i dont think ill decrease the cardio from here, only steps. im sure by 4 weeks out i might be almost doubling this cardio amount, although not ramping as aggressively as i have been the past 4 weeks. this is part of the reason i dont know if food will move much, as i am hoping to just outwork a greater deficit as needed rather than drop food to pathetic levels. imo, high food high activity will lead to a greater physique than lower food lower activity. 

**GEAR:**

TRENBOLONE!!! need i say more? this is all people really cared about right? but seriously. 10 weeks out i had added masteron, and i use a long ester. this gave 2 weeks for mast to build up as i introduce tren now, but as an acetate ester so it peaks very quickly. mast helps mitigate some of the tren sides, but now i am back to pinning daily. anavar has also come in, roughly 50mg a day. this is part of the reason why im digging so hard. with this much androgenic powerful compounds coming in, it makes sense to try to just slam hard on the pedal and see where it takes me. can always back off if needed as well.

350 test: no changes still

400 mast: technically 420, but whatever. this will probably stay here, i think thats enough dose to keep what im doing and giving me the look i need.

200 tren: techincally 210. if this moves at all, itll be in the final couple weeks but i highly doubt itll move. this is more than enough for me. its main job for me is to prevent muscle protein breakdown so i can push hard to get lean without losing muscle. secondarily is the ramp in thyroid production as my thyroid begins to slow down getting this lean, and 3rd is the cosmetic benefits. all in all a good drug for prep, but not something that typically can be ran for long periods of time without detriment. i have found 8 weeks to be the max i can get the benefits from it without deteriorating my look

50 anavar: doubt ill need more than that with other orals coming in. starting this early to get that jumpstart on more fat loss and help support the look as i come down in body fat more. var is a great drug and has low impacts on your liver so it feels like an easier drug to take this far out. have my nephrologist monitoring me so ill have my kidneys checked down the line. dont expect them to look perfect, but as long as im not in danger then im solid and i never use anavar outside of prep now anyways.

50 proviron: at 6 weeks out, this will come in. proviron binds to SHBG a lot, opens up a lot of free test and can lower your estrogen. this isnt that great of a drug on its own imo, but can be solid with certain other compounds or to help lower your estrogen. terrible for your hair and prostate tho. should help dry me out a bit more and bring some more hardness possibly

50 winny: at 4 weeks out, the final drug comes in. winny ALSO has a strong affinity to SHBG, but guess what? proviron has been taking care of that! so that means winny will give me much more benefit in other areas like hardness/separation. never used winny so this will be a learning experience on this one. to be honest, i might just be redundant with all the hardners i have going on, but fuck it i like to experiment and how else can i learn my body if i dont try it myself?

the holy trinity of injectables is in, and soon the holy trinity of orals will be in. its time to get freaky looking fellas

**THERMOGENICS:** 

As stated earlier, i have switched clen to 1 week on/off. if this enough to reset receptor sensitivity? probably not completely, but this is also why i will slowly ramp the dose up as well, capping at 80mcg a day. so far, clen hasnt been giving me any issues at all. no crazy heart pounding or anxiety, no shakes, just great fat loss and an increased RHR. Rauwolscine (alpha-yohimbine) on the other hand, gives me heart pounding and a little anxiety. however, this combo is just so incredible that i have no problems dealing with it. clen hitting the beta receptors for fat loss, and A-Y hitting the alpha receptors for the stubborn fat loss areas. covering all my bases, at some point i might just end up running them together for a brief period of time near the end to get any final fat i can before hitting the stage. my hamstrings are pissing me off and need to lean out quicker, however the likely case here is that i will lose my back legs last. i wont be surprised if my upper body is ready to go by 4-5 weeks out, its just getting that stubborn area out thatll take the final digs and drug pushes of clen + A-Y. you are only as lean as your fattest body part, so i pretty much only stare at my hamstrings at this point when looking at pictures, i dont even both looking at my abs or whatever. back has been leaning out really well too shockingly so ive stopped worrying so much about that. and for those wondering, yes clen + A-Y is going to come with a good amount of pounding heart and anxiety. its not something that can be used long term, and probably even short term would be too difficult for a lot of people. dont try this, it isnt necessary. ill report back of course on how it goes for me.

[RHR and SLEEP Graphs.](https://imgur.com/a/VMX8Qtw)


**SUPPLEMENTS AND ANCILLARIES:**

All supplements are currently the same, however soon i will be adding in P5P to combat prolactin build up from tren, Taurine to help alleviate the painful pumps i might end up getting from oral use, and NAC to help combat systemic inflammation from the tren and orals. Oh, and i added a sleep aid 2 weeks ago and am continuing that. Sleep aid from gorillaminds (idk what its called), the serving dose is 4 capsules i believe but ive only been taking 1 to start, and will slowly increase that as time goes on to help make sure i can get my meager amounts of sleep and be as rested as possible from it. 

**Miscellaneous:**

Watching the arnold gave me some good motivation, but i am also just completely focused on this now to the point of obsession (shocker, the guy who writes a fucking novel every other week is obsessed). Family visiting will be pulled back now, as arriving and them telling me they bought me donuts before my wife reminds them i cant eat that cuz of my diet is tiresome. A good buddy of mine told me he believes i have the potential to turn pro in 1-2 years which is awesome, and more friends in the gym telling me how excited they are to see my progress coming up to the show. Love to hear this stuff, but also hard to remember that i cant let that put tons of pressure on me or ill overstress and fuck up my look. Ill do everyone proud, but i also just need to kind of keep my head down and ears shut from things like that right now (but i will admit, it does feel good to have people believe in me). At this point im kind of just ranting along, but i needed a section to tell you guys where i am at mentally as thats just as important at this point of the game. I dream of losing every once in awhile, and im always devastated in the dream and when i wake up and it just furthers my drive to keep pushing. i try to daydream as much as possible about winning, and posing with confidence etc to try to keep as champion a mindset as i can. anyone whos dieted deep before understands this, my brain power/memory is starting to slowly decline. spacing out, bumping into things a little more often, forgetting things etc ""prep brain"" has started to slowly show up. patience is getting thinner than my hair soon, and im trying to make sure not to start pushing people away as the prep gets harder. 

**Weakpoints:** was told i have ""white boy arms,"" flat shoulders, and no chest (very true), and ""geek genetics."" decided that sounded dope, so i am probably going to start branding myself with Geek Genetics (training? fitness? idk if ill need another word after that). guess off season i need to get bigger arms, bigger shoulders, bigger chest, thicker back, and thicker hamstrings. yea no problem right?

**Strength:** occasionally i try a bb compound movement and it aint pretty. im absolutely weak as hell now. barely got 185 for 6-8 on flat bench the other day (mind you this was after incline machine work and flyes). still was able to do 315 for sets of 6 on SLDLs, but probably could do more with straps. leg strength isnt going that badly, but pressing power is horrible.

**Posing:** i really need to start practicing my routines and also work on posing stamina. 1 round and im winded usually, that has to improve significantly. heres something i think you guys should see too

[Feb 2021 Posing](https://imgur.com/a/2rsKx8p)

this is why i tell you guys to practice practice practice. it doesnt take much tweaks but those tweaks make HUGE differences in presentation. even now i am tweaking things and trying to make sure i am posing everything correctly and seeing if theres better ways to hit certain poses

**Hair:** this shit is gone man, it was nice while it lasted. probably be bald by christmas 

I might have missed some things, so if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below. If not, see you in 4 weeks and hopefully we will be looking like we are putting together a winning package!",2021-09-27 15:58:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pwk459/contest_prep_8_weeks_out_from_first_bodybuilding/

**16 weeks out:** Busy week, that sunday to start the week was my daughters bday party, so i had an absolute huge load in steps this week. Gear was building, nothing crazy or fun to report. calories started coming down and i was hungry but completely manageable. some more research was done into prep and i decided it was soon time to try things out.

**15 weeks out:** steps came down to a little more normal, maybe a bit high. caliper reading had me feeling good, weight staying up i didnt mind as i had a decent drop after the weekend. calorie drop a small bit and i was a little hungrier, but didnt need to make any changes to myself. i decided to try out clen this week and next to test some things which i will go into further depth later. Motivation and focus hits an all time high as the industry loses one of my biggest idols.

**14 weeks out:** Sunday i was so busy, it was 5pm and i only had 2 meals. Down 2k calories for the day, I decide to kill a craving and stay within calories by having 4 rolls of sushi. bloated me right up, now know that i cant carb load or anything with sushi as itll destroy my midsection. calipers looked ok, steps came up this week. was concerned all week as my weigh ins for 5 days straight was 209.4-.6

**13 weeks out:** Got the whoosh i was looking for, dropped 3lbs randomly in one night for monday morning. weight steadily climbed back up throughout the week but maintained at 208.4-.6 until saturday when i happened to weigh 1lb up back to 209.6. Saturday was a busy day, picked up a treadmill and had to run around so i once again ended up with 2 meals and down ~1600 cals. was out with the family, decided id have a real cheat meal as i thought it would be beneficially for social/psychological reasons. had a lettuce wrap burger, 2 baskets of fries, touch of cake for dessert, calorie tracker said i stayed within my calories for the day. that was my last meal of the day, popped 500mg of metformin before bed and woke up sunday morning 12 weeks out feeling amazing and looking amazing and down to 208.2. I also had this kinda weird epiphany moment this week. I was checking through pics for progress and realized that i really only noticed much in my midsection and maybe a bit in my back but nothing in my arms or shoulders. At first i was depressed about it, but then a couple minutes later i realize im an idiot. My biceps are skin lean, like back of your hand skin lean (pinch the skin on the back of your hand, same thickness on my biceps) and my triceps arent far behind so its obvious i wouldnt have any crazy visual difference, theres not much more difference to make. i felt much better about that and continued on with the plan!

Lets get to the part we care about

Now on to the plan for the following 4 weeks!

 **CALORIES:**

[Diet for 12, 11, 10, and 9 weeks out](https://imgur.com/a/7jpO2DD)

Carbs are getting shaved off and you can see fat has as well. Fat turns very minimal by 9 weeks out as my 1 red meat meal turns into chicken. It doesnt have to be chicken though, as last night i had ran out and decided to cook my tilapia for the meal instead. any hyper lean food source works, chicken is just cheapest and easiest. Still have all of the extras in the diet right now, little ketchup, chia seeds, little sugar free hazelnut creamer, chicken broth on my rice, none of which is accounted for in my calories. Extra veggies might have to come in around the 10-9 week out mark as such little amount of rice is starting to get depressing to my asian genetics. 

Current caffeine intake (dont judge me): 100mg preworkout, 1 coffee post workout, 1 white monster midday. On rest days, i start the day off with a bang (ha ha) and star blast flavor is the best dont @ me. midday ill probably have either a white monster or some iced coffee from starbucks. 

Also to note on rest days: i cut out the bagel/english muffins. drops 300 calories for the day in mostly carbs. 

**TRAINING:**

[Link to training again](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWaMYplH_v6dQZCtG7uZ1kJzmYDjsUAv0Spxav4TDGY/edit#gid=972061199)

Once again, this sheet was made strictly for you guys as i really dont care for strict tracking my training right now and i dont even do it all. Im trying to keep a small base track of some movements so i can pay attention to strength levels, but small muscle groups i just completely bro the fuck out which is why you see 0 tracking, although the volume listed is usually pretty dam close if not exact. small muscle groups is just get a pump, do whats available and i feel like doing. Doesnt help that my training partner just trains like the purest of meatheads you can think of. During this time, i actually tried flat bench for the first time in forever, and immediately after i was done with it a chick came to use it and she proceeded to outbench me. told my training partner im never doing bb bench again (jokingly, idc about being weak but dam shes fucking strong). also decided to bb squat, and that was also a good reminder of how i dont like squats, but also how as i lose weight that kind of movement pattern feels less and less stable. idk how you guys under 242lbs can feel stable in that movement. everything else, normal training for me as you guys know me. anything i wrote down in the sheet with a plus sign means i did a drop set after. one thing i did note, i run out of gas much quicker in the drop sets than before, reps during those extended sets just seem to disappear. losing pre and intraworkout carbs will do that to you i suppose.

**STEPS**

Steps are ramped up fast, but im happy to not have a step increase over the next 4 weeks. my goal currently has been 80k steps a week, but seems to end up around 83k. as long as i hit 80k im happy, which isnt terribly difficult as long as im conscious about it. Bringing my daughter to the zoo weekly, maybe the beach, etc adds a lot of easy steps. Costco shopping weekly, pacing around between sets at the gym, pacing when my foods in the microwave, any movement i can get it do. During my rest days, i was starting the morning with a brisk walk for about 30 minutes. is that cardio? a lot would probably say yes, but remember activity im doing with my watch on to count steps isnt cardio. 

**CARDIO**

Cardio has begun this week at 3 days for 20 minutes 10% incline and 3.2mph speed. not hard, but coming from no dedicated cardio its a great start to get the systems going. I pushed off starting cardio as long as possible because your body does adapt to it and thats the last thing ill want to be happening as i get leaner. however, i dont want to fall behind either so cardio comes in now, and possibly ramps up slowly over these next 4 weeks as im playing it by ear. 2 of the sessions are morning fasted (rest days), 1 session is afternoon. 

**GEAR**

Couple alterations to the intial plan, like pulling out proviron. The decision came from a couple thought processes. 1. i didnt wanna further hair loss right now and 2. i dont need it right now, so why take it. its great for pushing free test high, estrogen down, and giving me a harder look all of things i dont need right now and will save the balding for the end of prep.

350 Test: no changes to this at all

300 EQ: this will soon be dropped, as its been saturating for awhile and after i drop it 10 weeks out itll slowly come down and almost come out of the system by the time prep is ending so ill reap some benefits from this for the rest of prep

400 Mast: one of my favorite anabolics, starting early to get that DHT derivative action saturating for 2 weeks so itll be built in my system for when i introduce tren. Mast being a DHT derivative also can help a little with my metabolism and fat loss. Stays in the rest of prep and highly doubt ill be increasing it as i think ill max out the cosmetic effects of masteron at around 400mg.

GH: byebye GH. pretty simple, i run out. i could get more, and i havent fully committed to not, but i just really dont think i need to use the money on GH for a fat loss phase. it helps yes, but for the money and hassle i dont think its currently worth it. if i notice some radical negative changes, ill make sure to grab some and reintroduce it back at 2ius 5 days a week. 

**THERMOGENICS**

Ok i said i would talk more about clen here. So after looking more and more and more into clens usage for fat loss, i pretty much settled on that it has an efficacy of what seems like a max of 21 days. This is due to b2 receptors downregulating from clen. This is typically why you see a lot of people have different protocols of time on and time off. I decided to test how long i personally would be able to push clen before i adapted to it, so i started at 40mcg and settled on that for 2 weeks. well it turns out, after 1 week i started to lose some of the effects of clen and by the end of week 2 i was getting a lot less out of it. took my week off, and now entering 12 weeks out ill retest with the same starting dose but ramp up for week 2 to see if i can still eek out effects before stopping for another week break and then decide what my future protocol will be. Some people may be aware of the use of ketotifen, an antihistamine, to combat the downregulation of b2 receptors when taken in combination with clen. this is true, but also now comes with the side effects of the new drug your taking (no free rides as they say). sides of antihistamines? sleepiness, lowered energy, decreased metabolism, **increased hunger,** yea none of these things seem like something i want in prep. so im taking a drug for fat loss, and a 2nd drug to help that fat loss but it also increases hunger and lowers your metabolism? imo, not worth it but i know of people who use it to good effect. 

some interesting things for you guys to check out on my resting heart rate. you can actually see where clen stopped being so effective and when i stopped taking it, as well as in the zoomed out versions of more months you can see when i dropped tren and also probably get an idea of my blasts coming and going 

[RHR graphs](https://imgur.com/a/34eawXX)

**SUPPLEMENTS AND ANCILLARIES**

no changes to report, also will not be taking nebivolol most likely unless my BP tells me to. nebivolol is great for blood pressure and lowering your resting heart rate because its highly selective of the b1 receptors, but that also means it might slightly inhibit fat loss especially with the effects of clen. 

**Miscellaneous**

[BLOODWORK LINK!](https://imgur.com/a/SJlJiIT)

got my quarterly bloods done from my nephrologist done, he knows i have a show coming so we planned the next one to be just before peak week and i hope hes sitting down when he gets it. as for this test, RBC stuff should obviously be elevated, thats super typical with EQ. i make sure to stay hydrated, might need to take some baby aspirin, but tbh im not concerned with these numbers. One thing that shocked me was the creatinine drop. i was only concerned of it going up a bit, but was still expecting/hoping for it to stay in the 1.7s. Dropping to 1.56 was a great relief in my book, and i think i figured out what caused it although i know there are plenty of people who will furiously deny me. Supplements. Astragalus + dong quai continuously for months has helped drop my creatinine levels. No, its not drug changes or doses, ive ran more gear and less gear and even these same compounds before but in higher doses, and all of it was around 1.6-1.7s. No, its not training. ive done so many bloods, ive done them on rest days, training days, ive taken 3 days off of training, high volume, low volume, still sat in the 1.6-1.7 range. Super happy to find out im not seemingly wasting my money on the supplement. Also, if your freaking out telling me im going to die of kidney failure soon, ill let my nephrologist know he needs to be freaking out instead of telling me i look good because some random internet guy said so. plus, peep that cystatin C, *chefs kiss.* Hemoglobin A1C not moving is impressive. ive ran 2-4ius of GH almost continually from the time i got it tested before and it literally didnt change. guess the 5 on 2 off protocol really helps with that? idk, but its cool to know. Vit D has been coming down because my nephrologist told me too, didnt like it in the 80s as he didnt want me risking possible kidney stones so i have been doing 2000ius of vit D since february. Increased creatinine in urine made sense to me since its not in my blood anymore but again, doc said i look solid see you in 3 months lol. 

**Weakpoints:** yes im still aware i have them thank you

**Strength:** slowly coming down, but my training partner pushes me very hard so its not going badly

**Posing:** still no mirror for check ins at home, but feeling better about my posing

**Hair:** pls stop

Thanks for joining me once again, and i will see you guys in 4 more weeks! the suck will reallyyyy be kicking in by then and ill slowly be getting more and more irritated at everyone so expect me to seem like a dick which isnt unusual but ill be less likely to try and not be.

1garpmh,longevity,announcing AgingBiotech.info/companies version 2.0: BIG overhaul & update,"Announcing [AgingBiotech.info/companies](http://agingbiotech.info/companies) version 2.0, a giant overhaul & update:

* new columns
* 50+ new companies
* 200 companies fully up-to-date as of 2024 inc. all of the most noteworthy
* a new non-alphabetical default ordering based on rough significance (more on this below)
* grayscaling cells w/ older info (& still as-of dates for rows)
* mini preview pipeline images for companies that have them (change zoom to 200% to see better, or click each clinical stage column link)
* info needing elaboration marked w/ \*’s & elaborated in the notes column

There are still some small companies overdue for update & many in the “to be considered” tab to be moved to main list in coming months. Most are small or need decision whether they're aging-focused-enough.

Despite more to do, this update is a big enough improvement to launch.

As usual, but for those who don't know: The [AgingBiotech.info](http://agingbiotech.info/) website is not only **non-profit** but strictly **non-commercial**. No sales, sponsorships, or affiliate links. No money is received for listings or any kind of preferential treatment. No subscriptions. No Patreon account. This site is similar to Wikipedia in these aspects (and in spirit) but no financial donations are sought or accepted. The site is for the good of the aging/longevity community & ecosystem, and the wider public. Full disclosure statement in the About page.

Scope:

In the sequence: academia->biotech->clinic, this site focuses on the middle step. Companies are where academic science translates into something usable for millions of people. Aging science breakthroughs will have to go through companies to help society as a whole.

Only companies focused on aging or core-aging areas are in-scope. See “what counts as aging here” at [AgingBiotech.info/about](http://agingbiotech.info/about) for criteria.

This update adds columns to fine-grain aging focus, such ""aging mission?"" & ""core aging area?"". You can restrict based on these columns.

This has been a long time coming. Covid 1st halted company updates, then expanding the site to add new tables so that it covers everything important in the field. But sorry for the long companies table delay!

If you don't see the new version reload to clear browser cache.

Defunct & acquired companies were in diff tabs but are now in the main list for easy search. One can easily restrict them out of the list. See ""how to use the tables"" / ""how to sort & filter"" in the about page.

To see companies added recently, sort by “date added to list” col.

Ranking:

As noted in ""The Default Sort Order..."" in the about page, do not obsess over small position diffs in default sort. It is only meant to be a very crude, quick & dirty, sort to show rows that should be more prominent very roughly above others. It’s not a leaderboard.

The crude score formulas are a simplistic way to objectively (no manual eval) order rows so clearly significant rows go nearer the top. Inevitably, there will be cases where 2 rows appear to be relatively wrong, but it'd be impossible to find a perfect order, so it's not a goal.

There's no 1 col that makes more sense to sort by than a combo function & some significance sort is more useful than default alphabetical.

The formulas all transparent & inspectable. No hidden ranking. And anyone can resort by any other col or filter rows by any combo of cols.

The ranking criteria for companies involves many factors:

* operating companies favored over acquired companies which are in turn favored over failed/defunct ones
* bigger companies in terms of $ raised and # of employees tend to be listed higher up
* further in clinical trials goes higher up
* whole body aging for everyone favored over neuro/brain only or female-only aging/longevity
* pharmaceutical regulatory path companies favored over supplements & other unregulated stuff (eg unregulated apps, unregulated tests)
* aging being part of the company mission is favored
* companies that come to core aging conferences are favored
* therapeutics companies favored over diagnostic companies
* companies that have lists of publications on their site or that have a nice pipeline diagram get a small bonus

The result mostly makes sense even if there are likely examples where it feels to some people that some particular company should be higher or lower on the list. Sometimes that just isn’t reflected in the info that is publicly available. Making a perfect ordering is not a goal.

The companies table launched 5yrs ago!

I hope w/ this update it continues to help many people & to move the field forward.

In coming months I hope to release analyses of the past 5yrs growth of the field & its near-term prospects based on aggregate clinical trials pipeline.",2024-10-24 02:00:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/1garpmh/announcing_agingbiotechinfocompanies_version_20/
1dkb8xn,longevity,announcing AgingBiotech.info/therapeutics a table of available aging therapeutics,"Announcing: [AgingBiotech.info/therapeutics](https://AgingBiotech.info/therapeutics) (beta)  
a table of most available (potential) aging therapeutics: supplements, drugs, lifestyle, etc.  
  
The goal isn't to judge or rank them but to summarize other evaluations & link useful sources of details.  
  
Important notes:

Launching it not completely filled out on the assumption it's better to release the substantial info collected so far since many purported therapeutics are commonly discussed & used, but sometimes by people who haven't looked at much info.

Many people experiment w/ personal use of therapies despite that scientific understanding & eval of many is patchy. What data/analysis exists isn't easy to collect. There's no central place to find links to much of the relevant papers/data. This is meant to be one such collection.

The overall philosophy of [AgingBiotech.info](https://AgingBiotech.info) is that great things on the way from aging biotech but not yet available. Some people naturally don't want to wait, but one should be cautious of over-interpreting aging therapy data. This new table can aid deep dives. It's a jumping off point hopefully slightly better than just starting with a web-search.

This is absolutely not a recommended ""stack"", nor a direct endorsement. My sense is most molecules here don't have enough evidence yet for most to use them (especially at super-physiological levels) & the most important column is the who-needs-it column called ""best diagnostics/biomarkers to determine individual need & to titrate dose"", for which there are woefully inadequate answers for most things. I think a lot of people overestimate how much good many supplement or drug molecules will do & simultaneously my sense is that the lifestyle stuff is woefully underestimated & underutilized, & mostly safer.

Hope this is useful to some people.

q40w1m,longevity,What is the correspondence between lifespan of C. elegans studies and the human implications?," In looking at the phenomenal results published last year that screamed “Scientists Have Extended the Lifespan of These Animals by 500 Percent” I quickly then set up straight in my seat to take a look at what that might do for us.

“The two pathways which the team manipulated—known as the insulin signaling (IIS) and TOR pathways—are also found in people. The article says this means that the latest results could have implications for the development of new anti-ageing therapies.”

So, with that declaration I have three questions for the esteemed group reading these pages from which I might hope to get some insight on what this information can do for humble me.

1. What is the current thinking on how strongly nematode results can predict a possible human outcome following the suggested research?

2. I don’t believe we have any available supplements to effect those changes (correct me if I am wrong). What accessible molecules are there that can be utilized for research to mimic favorable impacts on insulin signaling (IIS) and TOR pathways?

3. Has there been any further exploration of this discovery for bringing us anti-ageing?",2021-10-08 16:09:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/q40w1m/what_is_the_correspondence_between_lifespan_of_c/
ohocpz,longevity,"Just a reminder to people who are taking longevity supplements because of positive effects on some health indices, thinking it will extend to lifespan.","*Initially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of growth hormone to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various biomarkers implicated in aging, such as decreased muscle mass, bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue.[[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199007053230101)] However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased mortality rate.[[15](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199909093411102)]* 

Does that story remind you of something that's current? Maybe  NAD precursors and senolytics/morphics that all seem to reverse the decline observed in some health indices?

Who's to say that these trendy compounds aren't just like the growth hormone in the 90s? Reversing biomarkers implicated in aging, but actually increasing mortality rate in humans.

In that sense, ""biomarkers of aging"" don't necessarily mean longer lifespan (or healthspan, actually). That's why the only real end-point for clinical trials in drugs for lifespan extension should be - age at death. Not grip strength, not muscle mass, not bone density, not epigenetic clocks. Age. At. Death.

Otherwise, who's to say we're not just doing the growth hormone stuff all over again, just with different molecules?

ohh7el,longevity,How much productivity has there been in 'geroscience' in the past decade?,"How much progress has there been in the 'productivity' of gero-science in the past decade? 

I suggest that there have been important advances in understanding the causes of the decades-long deterioration in homeostatic processes (ROS <-- mitochondrial metabolism; the role of the epi-genome in controlling 'rogue' processes such as transposon activity and cellular senecence). But there seems to be little consensus yet even on what a synthesis of that science might look like. 

There has been, too, a flood of mostly cultish 'supplements' that may (or more likely, may not) assist with restoring or maintaining cellular homeostatic processes; only one or two of which have 'gold standard' (largish, blinded, simple primary outcomes) evidence of relevant benefits.

Then the ""bottom line"" hasn't moved much since 2011, in my view. Resilience may be better understood, but achieveing life-extension for organisms other than models (yeast, worms and some lab-mice) still seems as ""promising"" a field of research -- and as far off -- now as it did then.

The evidence I tender is [this](https://archive.org/details/new-future-of-old-age-27-2-11-peter-w-gallagher.pdf-copy) short, decade-old article I wrote for ""Policy Magazine"" (Australia). In the article I discuss the economic impacts of the dramatic extension of life-expectancy in wealthy countries since the 1850s and the huge -- but mostly uncredited -- increases in wealth that these additional years conferred on individuals. I also speculate about the impact on the global economy of similar improvements in the life-expectancy of the much larger cohort of the Chinese and Indian middle classes by 2030.

The article concludes with a brief discussion of some geroscience of the time such as the promise of rapamycin's fasting-mimicry and the opportunity of telomerase-targets.  

But my question today, on re-reading the article, is: how much further has the science progressed? Is (say) the 'metformin' trial such a big step forward on where we were (I thought) in 2011?",2021-07-10 11:44:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/ohh7el/how_much_productivity_has_there_been_in/
