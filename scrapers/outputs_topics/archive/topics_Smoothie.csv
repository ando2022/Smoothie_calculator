of if not the most prevalent topics in health sport and nutrition in recent years this sub sees multiple protein-based questions every week the number of protein-fortified food products has soared influencers are drinking chicken smoothies etc one topic that i am surprised rarely comes up and yes i searched the sub history and found pretty much nothing is the exclusivity of protein utilization as a building block vs as a fuel source everywhere you look you will see calories attributed to protein this makes sense because proteins can be used to generate energy it's 4ish calories per gram although utilization is inefficient per tef and the real output may only be 3ish calories per gram this is why the calories for e g a 82g chicken breast is listed as 128 104 of which come from 26g of protein the problem with this common understanding is that our bodies need to use an amount newly-digested amino acids every day to replace degraded ones or to grow we can recycle some but not everything and an amino acid cannot simultaneously be used to build a protein and be deaminated for energy it's either one or the other of course the body's choice to use an amino acid for one purpose or another is quite complicated the common way to talk about it is to say that the body prefers carbs and fats for energy and won't turn to protein for calories unless it runs out of the other two however if you consume more protein than necessary the excess will be used for energy yes that energy will be stored as fat in excess and there is probably some protein metabolism happening at all times but we know there must be some amount of protein that does not enter our energy system at all because it gets used as building blocks for other stuff the entire reason protein is tending today is because of all the non-caloric benefits of protein - we're not drinking protein shakes because we need the calories let's say a typical person has a tdee of 2000 kcal and also needs 50g of protein for basic maintenance if such a person were to eat 2200 calories per nutrition labels including 100g protein it would appear that person consumed an excess of 200 calories do that every day and the math suggests that person will gain 20ish pounds of fat in a year - that's a lot but if 50g of protein is being used as building blocks to repair muscle build hormones etc then that person is not consuming excess calories at all they will not gain any weight given the obsession with calorie counting protein macro counting etc it puzzles me that we don't have common estimates for protein utilization there are endless debates about how much protein we should eat but no one is saying the first xg of protein provide zero calories i can imagine a few possible reasons for this 1 - this level of analysis doesn't boil down to easy advice like eat xg protein per day so no one bothers 2 - somehow our bodies really can have their cake and eat it too when it comes to amino acids 3 - utilization is actually quite a small percentage of protein consumed such that it is negligible maybe we're only using 5g per day and if we want to induce our bodies to use an extra gram we have to eat 20-30 grams 4 - no one has thought of it before probably not so what is really going on here"", 'should i take creatine a review of literature in the efficacy of creatine supplementation not intended as medical advice i see this question being asked a lot more and i think that s because in spite of creatine being relatively mainstream the stream it was mostly found in was the mass of people looking to improve their physical performance and appearance with the added hope of putting on some serious muscle of course creatine is not going to magically give you rippling delts huge lats and a 6-pack to boot but now it seems that regular people are showing a lot more interest i m not sure where that interest stems from but it s certainly worth diving into creatine as a supplement and whether your mom should be dipping into your supplement cupboard to sneak a scoop so what is creatine and should you supplement with it creatine is a naturally occurring compound synthesized from the amino acids glycine and arginine and is predominantly stored in skeletal muscles and the brain it plays a critical role in regenerating adenosine triphosphate atp the primary energy carrier in cells thereby supporting energy intensive activities - running lifting weights and even cognition because of the importance of creatine the body creates it endogenously meaning it produces it without having to obtain it through it dietary sources although it is also contained in foods like red meat and seafood but this is where supplementation comes into play - is your boy making enough for you to perform optimally certainly if you can walk around run lift weights etc you have a sufficient amount being made and obtained through your diet but what about if you want to perform even better run further get those extra reps and maybe even eek out a few extra marks on that test or find those key words during a presentation is creatine the answer based on hundreds of studies performed over the last couple of decades the likely answer is yes impact on muscular performance and strength extensive research has demonstrated that creatine supplementation enhances muscular performance particularly during high-intensity short duration exercises such as weightlifting and sprinting a study published in the journal of the international society of sports nutrition reported that creatine supplementation combined with resistance training significantly increased muscle strength across various populations wang et al 2024 now if living and living well until you turn 100 is a goal of yours like it is mine than you should know just how important strength is as you age want to pick up your grand or great-grand kids what about travelling those suitcase wheels aren t going to put it into the overhead compartment for you and oh no the elevator is down as it always is are you going to spend the next 48 hours in the lobby waiting for the repairman not if you ve got well established strength additionally a review in sports medicine found that creatine use can increase maximum power and performance in high-intensity anaerobic repetitive work by 5-15 that may not seem like much but ask any gym bro if they want to increase their bench press by 15 and they ll ask where they need to stick the needle maybe its not that impressive but for a regular person this could be the addition of an extra 1-2 reps per exercise or a faster sprint it also means overtime becoming stronger and improving your performance and ability to handle strenuous activity which in turn benefits almost every physical process in your body - think arterial and cardiovascular system effects on cognition beyond its physical benefits creatine has been investigated for its potential cognitive advantages a systematic review in experimental gerontology indicated that short term memory and intelligence reasoning might be improved by creatine supplementation though results across studies were conflicting another study in scientific reports found that a single does of creatine 5g improved cognitive performance and induced changes in cerebral high-energy phosphates during sleep deprivation for those that struggle with sleep creatine may also be a useful addition to one s morning smoothie or on the side of a cup of coffee especially on days where you were only able to clock 3-5 hours a 2024 study that subjected participants to 3-5 hours of sleep per night were then given supplemental creatine the results showed that participants receiving creatine showed better results in both cognitive and physical tests than the control group additional benefits neuroprotection and the delaying of certain neurodegenerative diseases has become far more mainstream rightly so clinical trials involving creatine supplementation have examined it s use in the treatment and delaying of progression and symptoms in huntington s disease hd and parkinson s disease in one double blind study doses of up to 30 grams of creatine were administered to participants daily while the other group received a placebo mri looked at brain atrophy at different times throughout the study to examine disease progression and brain atrophy it was found at the 6 month mark through mri that the participants receiving creatine showed lower rates of brain atrophy compared to the placebo group suggesting the creatine may be useful in slowing the progression of hd of course we have to consider this is only one study and 30 grams is a fairly significant does compared to what is recommended for the general population but the mechanism by which they believe creatine to be neuroprotective by providing additional atp resources to the brain appear to attenuate the disease s impact on the brain dosing and safety creatine has repeatedly been found to be safe for most people with few side effects apart from gastrointestinal issues in some individuals especially at higher doses above 5 grams per day there are always exceptions and anyone that may have kidney disease or that is taking prescription medication that may impact kidney function should be cautioned when considering supplementing with creatine as with all supplements consideration and discussion with their physician is recommended the typical recommended dose is 5g though it would appear higher dosing in the 10g 15g even 30g range depending is tolerated depending on your reason for supplementing with creatine will likely dictate the amount needed for muscular strength and performance 5g seems to be sufficient though someone carrying a significant amount of muscle may require more it would also appear that there are diminishing returns and taking 20g would not be more beneficial unless looking for neurological benefits though i think larger and more studies are needed to support the use of creatine in those applications finally there has often been discussion about loading phases where a higher dose is consumed in the first week to saturate muscles which typically lasts 5-7 days and then tapers to a regular 5g dose proceeding the loading phase there s been debate about whether or not that is effective and given some people s intolerance of higher dosing it s recommended to simply take 5g daily it can take up to 4 weeks of daily creatine use for muscles to become fully saturated though there should still be benefit from periodic use the studies seem to indicate benefit of a daily dose i don t believe creatine to be a polarizing supplement but if you ve had positive or negative experiences please share additionally if you would like to see more posts in r biohacking about a specific topic or supplement leave a comment and i ll do a deep dive', ""whey protein isolate and amino acids map i'm looking to supplement my protein intake as i find it challenging to get enough through regular meals a friend in europe who is very knowledgeable about fitness has suggested whey protein powder isolate and essential amino acids map i don't know if map is a specific brand or a type of amino acids and she is preparing for an event so i don't want to bombard her with questions she mentioned that using both whey protein and amino acids ma is beneficial even though many people tend to use one or the other 1 i would appreciate your recommendations for a good whey protein isolate powder available in the us 2 regarding protein powder usage i understand the general guideline is 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight could you share your thoughts on the best way to incorporate protein powder into my daily routine for example would it be more effective to take a larger serving like two scoops in a morning smoothie with fruit and coconut milk and then focus on reaching my remaining protein needs through real food at lunch and dinner or would you suggest splitting the intake perhaps with one scoop in the morning and another at night 3 as i said above my friend also mentioned specific essential amino acids called map are you familiar with any reputable brands or sources for these in the us 4 she also suggested that the combination of whey protein and map could improve skin health by providing the necessary building blocks for collagen production have you or anyone you know experienced any skin improvements from taking both 5 additionally she recommended taking 5 grams of creatine daily i'm aware there are varying opinions on creatine supplementation do you have any experience with creatine in addition to whey protein and amino acids and if so what dosage do you find effective for context i primarily lift weights at home using the heather robertson program my goal isn't to bulk up significantly but rather to maintain my current muscle mass and perhaps make slight improvements""]"

290 0 lowest weight 172 6 current weight 186 6 goal weight 145 0 i've struggled with my weight my entire life and gained around 100 pounds from a medication i was on in my early 20s i'm one of those people that lost and gained the same 30-40 pounds multiple times but nothing ever stuck about 2 years ago after being diagnosed with multiple auto-immune and arthritis-based conditions i was basically desperate to do anything to try to feel better and reduce the pain inflammation so i started by focusing on whole foods then walking daily then following an anti-inflammatory mediterranean diet after a few months i also started going to physical therapy multiple times a week and doing quite a bit of resistance training for the first time in my life weight loss was actually easy i routinely lost at least 5-10 pounds a month and ended up losing nearly 120 pounds in about 15 months then in october it just completely stopped at first i wasn't particularly concerned because i knew i would probably hit a plateau at some point i had also recently changed physical therapy providers and was lifting heavier weights so i thought that could be part of it while i don't totally trust my body comp scale it seemed to think i had gained 3 or 4 pounds of muscle so when i was weighing a few pounds heavier i didn't mind as long as it was muscle i hung out around 175 for a couple of months and since it was thanksgiving christmas and we traveled for several weeks i wasn't being strict about tracking calories or anything and planned to basically make a push to lose the rest of the weight after the first of the year january came and i became more focused on weight loss again started tracking again upped my walking all the things and nothing happened not only did i not lose any more weight i was slowly starting to fluctuate up into the higher 170s around april i started seeing weights in the low 180s again after a last-minute cross-country trip at the end of may for a funeral i came back home and the scale was 196 6 i freaked out about the prospect of being over 200 again so for the last 3 weeks i've been incredibly on track i tend to get very inflammed when traveling and i did drop the 12 pounds or so i was up within a few days but despite doing all the right things i'm just not being able to budge from the mid-180s i have historically used myfitnesspal but i switched to loseit last week i track and weigh measure everything i drink a ton of water about 1 5 gallons a day i do pretty well with my protein goals and great with fiber i have been very strict about my anti-inflammatory mediterranean diet as far as no added sugar tons of vegetables only lean protein no red meat a good amount of beans etc a typical day is a smoothie for breakfast with something like strawberries blueberries lots of spinach and pea protein usually a bowl for lunch with something like chicken shrimp zucchini beans and rice and normally something like fish with a couple of veggies for dinner i'm not a big snacker i usually have a coffee with fairlife milk in the morning and possibly an oikos triple zero yogurt in the afternoon before or after physical therapy as far as exercise i live in southern arizona and temps have been 110 lately so walking outdoors has mostly not been an option but i do typically ride my exercise bike 4-5 times a week i also have physical therapy twice a week where i do strength training both with resistance bands and weights i usually do additional sessions of that at home throughout the week in other seasons of the year i typically walk 5-6 days a week and hike 1-2 a week i have been considering purchasing a walking pad to use during the hot summer months i've worked with a dietician for almost 2 years since just a few months into this weight loss journey for a variety of reasons mostly tmj-related easting restrictions and then a serious bout of gastritis there were times when my ability and desire to eat were affected so eating 1200-1300 calories was about all i could manage but for the majority of my weight loss i was eating more like 1500 calories when my weight loss plateaued my dietician initially suggested eating more like 1800 calories but i feel like that's when i started gaining from 175ish back up to 185ish i tried going back to around 1500 calories but that didn't seem to move the needle either when i joined loseit they suggested eating around 1350 monday-thursday and 1550 friday-sunday based on the parameters i provided i tried that last week and that was fine i averaged about 1440 calories with exercise the average was 1200 and felt satiated for the most part but i actually ended up gaining weight it's so frustrating to me because i'm typically able to eat 100 at home monday-thursday and the scale will start trending down but then the second i eat away from the home i gain it all back and more i obviously try to limit eating out but the reality is that it is going to happen 2-3 times a week when i'm socializing with friends thursday night i attended a potluck but i was incredibly mindful about what i ate i brought chicken breast and a broccoli salad where i'd have something lean to eat i only got one small plate i had pre-tracked calories before i arrived to know how much to get same thing friday when my husband and i went out to dinner i picked a healthier option i knew exactly what i was going to order only ate half tracked everything and then saturday i hosted a party but same thing was really mindful stuck to the light options really ate slowly and listened to hunger cues and after all of that to be up almost a pound and a half versus down the pound and a half i should have been is just so incredibly frustrating i recognize that the higher sodium in foods outside the home probably account for my weight being up and that it may drop again in the next couple of days but i'm just so tired of feeing like i'm stuck in this cycle of thinking i'm losing again and then it just going right back up i know that i'm working against my body as far as inflammation and that i do have physical limitations that prevent me from more aggressive forms of exercise but i just feel like something is wrong at this point my dietician doesn't seem to understand my level of frustration my therapist seems to think i should just accept that this is my new set point and my husband thinks i'm massively overreacting since i'm literally 100 pounds smaller than i was but now that i'm smaller every extra ounce seems to go straight to my stomach and i'm so tired of feeling like i look like i swallowed a basketball i've worked so hard to just feel like i never look good in clothes or to feel like i'm still the biggest girl in photos and i'd be lying if i said i don't care about aesthetics appearance but really and truly it is more about my health to me with all of the health problems and diagnoses i ended up developing high blood pressure and i desperately want to get to the point that i'm able to discontinue those medications i also want to do everything i can to limit extra weight and stress on my joints i also don't want doctors to ever be able to use my weight as an excuse of why i'm in pain or things like that i also know menopause my not be far around the corner so i just very much feel like now is the time to lose the rest of the weight as i know it will likely only get harder the older i get and the more my medical conditions progress i know that's a lot but what can i do to lose another 40 pounds i feel like i've tried everything i keep trying to get to the bottom of what changed and the thing is there's a million variables around the time my weight loss stalled i had quite a bit of medication changes i had to discontinue my celebrex nsaid due to the gastritis not healing so it stands to reason inflammation is a bigger challenge though last time my inflammation markers were checked they were in the normal range for the first time ever as my gastritis healed i was able to come off my high dose of omeprazole and also decreased my famotidine and i do think those had an impact on my appetite also with the gastritis i had to discontinue some of my anti-inflammatory supplements like turmeric and vitamin d also last fall i found out i was extremely anemic so i did have to do a round of high-dose iron but that has now corrected itself and is back in the normal range i also had an unsuccessful procedure to get steroid injections in my si joints in october and then surgery to remove an endometrial polyp back in december i'm just really at a loss as to what the issue is i eat so clean and i focus so much on whole foods that i just don't know what more improvements i can make at this point i personally believe that things are not always as simple as cico but at the same time the math is just not mathing at this point please help"", ""program review - recovering powerlifters by geoffrey verity schofield i don't see a lot of bodybuilding-focused program reviews here so i'm hoping this one will be well-received i know gvs generally has a solid reputation in some of the bodybuilding subs but in my opinion he's somewhat of an underrepresented individual in this space i don't agree with absolutely everything he does says but after running this program of his it's difficult to argue that his methods don't work tl dr - made some of the best gains in my life in as little as eight weeks background i'm a 29-year old male 30 in a couple months with a background in track field and rugby from high school since then i've focused pretty much entirely to lifting i don't compete in anything but my training over the years has been very solidly powerlifting-focused i've been lifting off-and-on since my track days in high school i got serious with strength training a couple years after that though but i would go through spurts of focusing heavily on lifting then either switching focus to other hobbies for a while or just not having time in the day to go to the gym for whatever reason i would estimate my total training age to be approximately five years as far as my life outside of the gym i work from home have access to a home gym with a power rack platform barbell adjustable dumbbells ssb and some other goodies here and there and i also have a free membership to a local gym because i coach there i am incredibly fortunate to have this level of flexibility and variety in how where and what i train programs i've run include fierce 5 the first program i ran out of high school nsun's various gzcl programs gzclp j t 2 0 general gainz and a whole bunch of cycles of greg nuckols' 28 free programs which i had been running on a harsh cut immediately before beginning recovering powerlifters speaking of which here are my stats the day i started this height 5'10 3'1 - - - weight 183lbs 176lbs squat 475lbs lifetime 455lbs bench 275lbs lifetime 240lbs deadlift 600lbs lifetime 585lbs lifetime prs were hit about a month before the current numbers lost some strength due to the cut not that these numbers really matter but hopefully they give you a sense of where i was at the program i'm not going to go into too much detail here the program is available for free on boostcamp however i prefer using google sheets for my programming so i followed the instructions in gvs' video on the program and made my own spreadsheet for it in summary however recovering powerlifters is a 12-week bodybuilding program with emphasis on common weak points in the physique of a strength-based athlete like myself it is ran 5 days a week with three upper body days and two lower body days and contains heavy emphasis on arms and delts one of the upper body days is entirely arm and delt movements which is great because mine are were absolutely tiny and shapeless from years of focusing on sbd i generally kept to the program as written opting to drop sbd almost entirely i swapped a couple exercises out for other exercises out of preference or due to equipment availability on the days i trained at home as time went on i also swapped out a few exercises here and there if i either got bored of them or felt they weren't doing much for me about the only powerlifting movement i kept in for the duration of the program was ssb squats one day a week i would consider this to be a moderate-volume high-intensity program at least how i ran it every single set was taken at a minimum one rep away from failure there were times that i recognized i sandbagged a set - if that happened i would do one extra set and make sure i pushed myself as hard as i could that being said i'm confident that the vast majority of my work was done at or at least very near failure there isn't really a clear progression scheme like you would find in most strength programs i basically just increased the weight if i reached the highest point of the prescribed rep range on the first set gvs does incorporate autoregulation in the form of adding a set if you feel good - i used this option to add a set if i couldn't add a rep from the previous week i felt this really helped push the progression though it's not necessarily part of the program to do so the diet my eating started off very consistent but kinda ended up all over the place more on that later my aim here was to gain as much lean mass as possible while minimizing body fat gain skip to the results section for details on how that went i aimed for an average rate of gain of about half a pound a week - however i don't count calories because that's boring and instead relied on how the scale was moving to inform my eating i overshot my weight gain goals a bit but i'm not unhappy about that there were two things i consumed almost every single day from the start of the program greek yogurt with chocolate protein powder granola literally tastes like chocolate pudding and two cups of ultrafiltered chocolate milk as time went on i needed to add some extra calories so i added things like trail mix pb j's smoothies and so on for lunches and dinners i usually did some sort of meal prep where i would cook a whole bunch of protein braised beef or pork is a favorite of mine for this cut up and freeze a rotisserie chicken wash and cut a bunch of veggies and so on then my wife and i could make a bunch of different kinds of wraps bowls sandwiches and so on this has been working well for us as she's been working and studying and my work hours go into the evenings so we can't really make dinners together often that being said all this kind fell apart around week 9-10 because we added a puppy to the family and as it turns out puppies are a lot of work and take up a lot of time and attention the process the initially adjustment to the very high-intensity training style that i did here took some getting used to that being said i've never felt like i've earned my progress more than i have running this program some of the days were brutal especially the leg days - bulgarian split squats to failure friggin' suck dude but the rate at which i progressed proved to me that in the past years i just haven't been training hard enough that was kind of a bitter pill to swallow but one that was much needed on occasion i did have to cut workouts short for whatever reason but i didn't feel this impacted my progress significantly everything went really really well up until the point where we picked up our puppy i took that first week with him off and in the second week i returned to do some quick workouts in the home gym then in the last week of the program i injured my neck unrelated to lifting and took a few days off again while i focused on getting it back into reasonable shape all this combined with kinda crappy eating resulted in lackluster progress in the last few weeks of the program that being said i consistently got stronger across pretty much every single movement i did throughout the program even on my ssb squats which i added about 30lbs to over the 12 weeks if i couldn't match reps from the previous week adding an extra set was always enough to push my progress the results this section is gonna be a little bit different i don't have any lift numbers i'm going to share however with the help of this calculator from stronger by science i tracked my changes in weight lean body mass fat mass and body fat percentage for every single week of the program every four weeks i also took whole-body measurements to see how much i was growing you can find that spreadsheet here i even made a page for imperial for all you freedom lovers out there in short i peaked around week 9-10 which is right before we got the puppy and declined overall somewhat after that point due to all the factors i already discussed see the table below for a summary of the results up to the end of week 12 stats before kg lbs cm in week 8-10 peak end - - - - weight 79 2 175 6 85 41 187 85 23 187 9 body fat 15 16 15 98 16 57 fat

about 1 5 percent to my bodyfat and even then a lot of that increase came from the last couple weeks when i started eating like crap disclaimer i know these numbers may be very approximate that being said i feel confident in their general accuracy i didn't take many physique photos almost entirely because i pretty much suck at getting good consistent lighting that i feel accurately shows the progress i'm making that being said below are a couple photos i took the first one is from april 3 so week 3-4ish and the second is from the end of week 8 so a 4-5 week and approximately 7lb difference in bodyweight for some other observations i started noticing some quad separation at rest in certain lighting which i've literally never seen before in my legs around week 8 at around week 5 my wife told me i need a bra for my b-cups some random old guy on the street told me i look strong at one point in there so yeah that's all kinda cool the final thoughts honestly if you've ever felt like you're not training hard enough that you don't know what true failure feels like or honestly even if it's been a while since you've done some absolute eye-bursting lifting give a gvs program a try your mileage may vary but at no point did i feel like i was really getting run-down i'm confident that had the puppy not come into the picture that i would have been totally fine running the full 12-weeks all the way through bodybuilding is super terrible and fun and everything in between and i highly recommend giving a pure bodybuilding-focused program a go even if it's not from gvs what's next honestly now that i'm getting back into the swing of things with training and eating i'm gonna run this again but with a few tweaks to further emphasize arm shoulder development i'm going to move those exercises to the start of the workout i'm also going to add additional rear delt movement to bring those up further because i felt mine could handle a crap ton more volume if i wanted i'm also going to shift focus to hamstrings rather than quads my quads are in decent shape but my hammies are a bit unbalanced i feel i'll also be doing these at the start of my leg days rather than after quads and will also add some extra sets i'll also do high-intensity lengthened partials for my leg curls my goal is to continue bulking until my body fat percentage hits roughly 20 i dunno how heavy i'll be at that point but i'm sure i'll continue to get way more jacked"", ""program review brian alsruhe's mass builder my background i m 28 years old and have been lifting consistently for the past 8 years since i largely learned about programming from lurking on reddit i ve tried just about every program that s been popular here since 2015 many variations of 5 3 1 and gzcl greg nuckols programming sheiko mag-ort and brian alsruhe programs to name a few over this time i ve gone from being a 160 lb 6 skellie up to 213 lb as of the start of this program i ve done two powerlifting competitions but once i tried strongman i found that i enjoyed it much more i ve competed in 5 strongman competitions 2 novice and then 3 open i m not very competitive yet never having gotten out of the bottom half in open competitions in the past 2 years i ve had several health problems that have prevented me from gaining much strength in early 2021 i got a strain in my right glute that made deadlifting anything above 225 lbs extremely painful i could do elevated deadlifts though so i decided to train for a competition in the summer that had a ukrainian deadlift while also doing the daily rehab work prescribed by my physical therapist unfortunately during that competition i broke my thumb by smashing it on my belt when lowering an axle clean i still finished the competition and actually did better on the events post-broken thumb than pre-broken-thumb but i did need surgery to repair my hand which meant 6 weeks off from any form of lifting this did seem to benefit my glute injury which had completely disappeared by the time my surgeon cleared me for lifting again but i didn t have much time to get back into training before i caught a very rough case of covid in january 2022 even after beating the virus my lungs were really weak and for 2 months i couldn t do any exercise more strenuous than a mile long walk i ve eased myself back into training over the spring and fall of this year while also going through many major life changes finishing grad school moving in with my girlfriend and starting a full-time work-from-home job i ve been lucky enough to have the money and space to build up a nice home gym in my basement with a bunch of strongman implements in my garage a strongman competition i was planning to do in november got cancelled but that was okay by me when my training partner and i did a mock meet with lighter than contest weights my log numbers were 20 lbs lower than i needed to be to not zero the event and it took me about 20 minutes for my breathing and heart rate to recover from the truck pull loading medley why i picked this program i wanted to get my lungs and conditioning back on track while also focusing on building up my overhead strength my gym setup only allows me to use implements outside but the cold wet snowy weather where i live in northern illinois makes that untenable in the winter i thought the giant set format that brian alsruhe s programming uses would be a good way to build up work capacity for strongman without the need to use implements or do moving events i had really enjoyed my incomplete runs of his powerbuilder and darkhorse programs so i already knew what i was getting myself into of brian s programs the mass builder sounded like the most fun contained giants sets with a dedicated conditioning movement and gave me a great excuse to go on a proper winter b u l k t o 220 and fill out the middleweight weight class program structure and my customizations this table summarizes how i set up the

workout of the alsruhe mass builder has three components giant sets of a main lift variation which is where the heaviest work is done in this program if you want heavy competition squat bench deadlift you ll be disappointed with this program giant sets emom work with a main lift then an assistance finisher there s also optional dedicated conditioning that you can slot in at the beginning or end of the workout it s a upper lower split with 2x week frequency for squat bench deadlift and ohp or close variations brian s original version is a 4x week program run in four 3-week waves i wanted to put extra emphasis on overhead pressing but could not do standing ohp due to the 7 2 ceilings in my basement gym so i did seated ohp instead i also added an extra day to the base program with incline bench as the main lift and added slingshot bench in as an additional pressing variant each workout took about 60-80 minutes including setup and teardown time variation lifts the main lift variations have a rotating percentages system where in each 3-week-long wave you ll have a heavy medium and light day for each variation where the reps decrease as the weights are heavier each wave has slightly heavier and lower reps than the previous wave i e wave 1 s medium sets reps are wave 2 s light sets reps wave 1 s heavy sets reps are wave 2 s medium sets and so on the variation work is done in a giant set of four exercises with an antagonistic movement the main movement a core movement and then a conditioning movement the antagonistic movement is horizontal vertical pull for the bench press and for squat and deadlift brian considers the antagonistic lift an explosive jump or hip extension the variation lifts i used were the close-grip bench high handle trap bar deadlift slingshot bench ssb squat and z press giant sets the 4 exercise giant sets can be quite overwhelming to plan out only the main mover has programmed set rep schemes and you need to figure out your own progression schemes for the other 3 lifts it could have been a massive programming rabbit hole but i think i came up with a few simplifications to make it easier to set up and execute i kept the pulling and core movement the same for both the variation and main lifts on each day to reduce the setup time and number of exercises i had to choose for example on the close grip flat bench day i did barbell rows as my pulling movement and dragon flags as my core movement for the slingshot and flat bench my progression scheme for pullups was to do 7 per set in wave 1 and added one per set in each wave for barbell rows i did sets of 8 9 then 10 in each week of each wave with the weight increasing by 10 lbs per wave for cable rows i always did sets of 10 with weights increasing by 10 pounds for two weeks and dropping back by 10 for the next wave 2 steps forward 1 step back after wave 3 i felt that i had been too conservative with the weights increases so i didn t decrease the weight going into the final wave i didn t really have a progression scheme for face pulls band pullaparts i just did about 15-20 of them with the same bands throughout the program i think it makes sense to not push hard on these movements as they re easy prehab movements that are paired with lower-body lifts that are far more taxing than any pressing for the core work my initial thought was that timed holds would be harder than rep work so i would do rep work on the lower body days to try to make those giant sets a bit easier i did dragon flags on my closegrip flat bench day since i could do those without even moving from the bench i started at 4 reps and added one per wave i did ab wheel rollouts on trapbar dl squat days starting at 5 reps per set and adding 1 per wave i did timed superman holds and planks on slingshot ohp and z press incline days respectively i started at 40 seconds and added 5 seconds each wave on the ssb deadlift days i initially did hanging leg raises but as the waves progressed my grip became a limiting factor when part of the deadlift superset since the deadlift hanging leg raises and kb swings were all taxing my grip i wasn t happy with how much i had to wait for my grip to recover so i eventually swapped these out for the superman holds and found that worked fine for every giant set on each day of the workout my conditioning movement was a kettlebell swing with my plate loadable kettlebell it s a movement i haven t done very much and i also wanted to justify my recent purchase of rogue s adjustable kettlebell to myself since i was doing the same weight every week it took no setup time this was also the easiest conditioning exercise to do in a low-ceilinged and cramped basement where there was not enough space to do unlike things like hammer swings jumps barbell complexes or animal walks i did 10 kb swings per set with 58 lbs two 25 lb plates plus 8 lbs base weight in the first week then added a rep per week through week 9 at that point the swing sets were starting to get really long and a bit boring and hard for my brain to count when in a meatheaded fugue state so in the final cycle i increased the weight to 68 lbs and did 10 swings set in week 10 12 swings set in week 11 and 15 swings set in week 12 now that i ve got lots of experience with the movement maybe i ll hop on the bandwagon for the 10 000 kettlebell swings in a month challenge main lifts after the variation lift giant set the second part of each workout has you doing your main lift at one of three rep schemes light 10x3 emom medium 4x8 giant sets or heavy 5x5 giant sets these lifts start at 55 60 and 70 respectively and increase by 5 each wave the light emom work is not done as a giant set so those workouts go by much quicker my main lifts were the bench press back squat seated overhead press deadlift and incline bench assistance finishers the third component of each workout is an assistance finisher which also have heavy medium and light versions that you cycle through in each wave these in effect are like wods that you do at the end of your workout i pulled these from a variety of sources brian alsruhe s videos u mythicalstrength s book of bad ideas agonist supersets rather than the antagonist supersets that brian alsruhe is well known for based on this video from mike israetel and from pump workouts my training partner and i used to do the goal here was to find fun ways to get in a bunch of accessory work in a short period of time and i d often end up with a pump as a nice bonus optional conditioning brian does include optional conditioning section either at the start or end of the workout i tried out doing a dedicated conditioning segment at the end of my very first day running the program which consisted of doing 10 minutes of alternating between sets pull-ups dips and kettlebell swings for 10 minutes straight i was totally gassed after doing this and decided that i would just push hard on the giant sets throughout the program and not do a separate conditioning portion of the workout which i think was the right decision even without dedicated conditioning i would just come upstairs and lay on the couch for a while after finishing each workout more exercise would have made me useless for the rest of the evening scheduling i had two vacations and 3 trips for work while running this program which when combined with adding an extra day per week made this 12 week program take 13 5 weeks for me to complete when possible while travelling for work i d do assistance finishers from the upcoming week s workouts in the hotel gym it was nice to get some exercise in while travelling which reduced soreness when returning to my regular schedule and also shortened the workouts in the upcoming week i did not skip any workouts but on days when i ran out of time to work out or got too gassed i would stop after finishing the variation or main work and finish the rest of the workout on the following day results my lift numbers in

way the variation lifts are set up is exceptionally well designed at first glance it s reminiscent of 5 3 1 where you have 3 sets which each increase in intensity by 10 while the rep ranges get smaller with the final set being an amrap but unlike 5 3 1 the percentages are based on true maxes rather than a training max also unlike many variants of 5 3 1 where the first two sets often feel like they re your last warmups i never felt like the first two sets here were too easy they always felt like solid working sets before doing the amrap set of the day i d look at my past few weeks performance and pick a goal rep number that would give me a small estimated 1rm pr or at least more reps than the last time i did an amrap at that weight the rotating structure of the heavy medium and light weights means that you never repeat the same amrap weight closer than two weeks apart this makes it pretty easy to hit either a rep pr with a weight or an estimated 1rm pr every time you work out which was always a good motivational boost that made me excited to continue and move on to the next section of the workout over the course of the program i always got at least 2 reps over the minimum target on the amraps and i always either tied or beat my previous rep record with any given weight with so many amraps at so many different percentages of my maxes i was able to develop a quite accurate sense of how close to failure i was getting the last rep of the amraps was always slow and sometimes grindy but only once during the 60 amraps i did over the course of the program did i get too greedy with an amrap and fail a rep while it s a complicated progression scheme that requires a spreadsheet this program has by far my favorite use of amraps as a fun challenge that keeps the workouts engaging and challenging in the first cycle the giant sets left me pretty gassed and i was taking as much as 4 minutes between them especially on lower body days by the end of the program i was down to around 2 minutes of rest between giant sets on the upper body days and around 3 minutes on lower body days a great sign that my conditioning had significantly improved early in the program i would often just lay down on my bench for a few minutes after finishing the workout but i found myself doing that less often at the end of the program even though all the weights were much heavier and all the assistance work had gotten harder main work analysis emom work was my favorite of the three rep schemes for the main lifts emom work gets you very efficient at doing your setup because the faster you complete your set the more rest you get before your next set i think they re also a good way to get a good stimulus from weights that are further away from your max these workouts also tended to be among the shortest especially for the lower body workouts i ll definitely be doing more emom work in the future the 5x5 and 4x8 rep schemes were not as fun as the emom work they also took quite a bit more time due to the giant set format typically being 25-30 minutes for 5x5 and 20-25 for 4x8 whereas emoms were done in 10 minutes that said the weight percentages were expertly chosen after finishing the first wave i thought there was no way i d be able to hit the weights called for in the final waves but in the end i was just strong enough to get through everything the final wave has you doing 5x5 85 of your max and sometimes got a bit grindy but i never missed a rep any program that can get you up to doing 5x5 85 in 12 weeks is truly impressive in order to balance out the length difficult of workouts i should have done assistance finishers that were shorter on the 5x5 and 4x8 days with the option to do longer ones on the emom days the lower body days were often very draining especially if the main lift was a 5x5 or 4x8 rep scheme there were a few times when i was feeling really tired and i d just do the first one or two thirds of the workout and complete the rest of the workout on the following day i had expected these workouts to be harder than the upper body workouts and tried to make the lower body workouts less draining by doing easy prehab movements as the first element of the giant set but this alone wasn t enough lower body workouts were made even harder when i travelled and would drop below 2x week frequency on lower body lifts to avoid crushing doms i think i d prefer to have some upper and lower body work on every day so that my frequency is high enough that i won t ever go too long between squat dl sessions this was compounded by my decision to add a third upper body day which meant that the weekly schedule was ululu rather than ulul which sometimes made for too many days between lower-body workouts after my first intense leg soreness that made it embarrassingly hard to stand up and sit down the next day i decided i d proactively swap around workouts when i was going to be travelling to try to minimize the time between lower body workouts i still think that my soreness is kept in check best by having some form of squatting deadlifting on at least 3 days per week to make that work with the wave structure of this program while still doing a good job of managing fatigue would require some careful work it would even open up the possibility of upper lower body giant sets which i really enjoy as a time-saver assistance finisher analysis i hadn t done many challenge-style wods before this program and found that i really loved them i think other lifters give crossfit wods a bad rap but i think they can be a nutritious part of a complete program i expect that many assistance finishers i did for this program will enter my regular rotation if you keep the same assistance finishers for each cycle then you ll be revisiting them every three weeks much like the amraps in the variation work this is enough time for most people to have gotten stronger and have a good chance of exceeding their previous performance which is always a fun motivational boost i ll discuss some of the highlights and lowlights of my assistance finishers few paragraphs if you want more thoughts on the other finishers i did let me know in the comments mythical strength s 2 bonus to squats is a great workout for squats or really any lift where your max is 350-600 and i loved doing it for both the back squat and the trap bar deadlift start with a weight that can be made with 45s and 25s that s around 85-90 of your max and do a hard set of 1-5 reps then remove a 25 45 and do 2 more reps than in your first set and repeat until you re at 135 or you give up get bored run out of time it gives a great pump and is basically a slow way of putting away your weights my heavy ohp finisher was initially going to be crossfit grace do 30 clean and press with 135 lbs as fast as possible with seated strict press unfortunately because i m so awful at seated ohp i wasn t going to be able to complete 30 reps so i turned it into a challenge to get as many reps at 135 as i could and ended up getting 13 15 20 and 22 reps in each cycle i ll reuse the format of get as many reps as possible with x lift at y weight in 10 minutes which should work well for a wide variety of lifts bring sally up perform reps in time with the lyrics of this song total of 30 reps over 3 5 minutes was a lot of fun on squats i did it with an ssb to take arm elbow wrist cramping out of the equation i increased the weight each cycle starting with just the bar and finishing with 155 lbs but probably had room for more for pushups however i hated it i was limited more by my inability to hold a plank for much more than a minute than by chest tricep strength which led to me just feeling like i was wasting my time once i couldn t plank in between pushups so i didn t get a pump and did about 15 pushups while with a plank for a minute and a half in cycle 4 i swapped this workout out for doing 100 bodyweight dips in as little time as possible getting it done in 10 minutes flat this was much more enjoyable and something i ll probably do again a finisher that i love doing whose origins i can t remember is the dumbbell press incline drop set wherein i start with a dumbbell seated overhead press and then drop the angle of the press rather than the weight so that eventually i m doing a flat bench this works well if you have an adjustable bench with lots of settings mine has 10 from 0 to 90 degrees in 10 degree increments increments but might not be as fun if you don t have many settings for extra fun you can superset with one or two other isolation movements i really enjoyed doing agonist supersets as part of a bench or bench variation pyramid i d do a set of 10 tricep extensions then 3-5 bench presses add 20 lbs to the bench and repeat until i got to a max effort weight then drop by increments of 10 lbs on the way back down this ended up being around 15 sets usually took around 20 minutes and was a ton of fun if you want more rest you can also add in a curl to the mix but don t rest in between doing each exercise for the maximum pump mythical strengths 135 trap bar deadlift amrap was a great test of grip and will i ended up increasing my total number of reps each time i attempted it going from 30 reps in cycle 1 to 51 in the last cycle this is one i ll do regularly i d love to get into the triple digits with this diet recovery etc i have a work-from-home engineering job and haven t been doing much physical activity outside the gym i should have made more of an effort to go on a daily walk during the winter but only went for walks on days when i had to run errands around 3 times per week i sleep about 6-7 hours per night on weeknights and around 8 hours per night on weekends since i work from home and love to cook i seldom eat out unless i m travelling in order to bulk for this program i added became a hobbit and added a second breakfast this was either a bagel with cream cheese or sausage patty and fried egg on an english muffin with aioli my main breakfast was a smoothie of a banana cup of frozen fruit cup of oat milk cup of orange juice scoop of protein powder and scoop of creatine the only supplement i take lunch was either leftovers from earlier in the week or chicken sandwiches with chips and some fruit my girlfriend is a vegetarian so most of the meals i cooked for dinner were vegetarian but always having a good amount of legumes tofu eggs cheese for protein and rice potatoes pasta for carbs sometimes in addition to the vegetarian food i d cook up a chicken breast for myself i d eat some ice cream or cookies for dessert a few times per week and would have 2-3 drinks on a few nights per week advice for success with this program think carefully about the logistics of your giant sets don t be like me and do hanging leg raise right after deadlifts your grip won t hold up dragon flags as a core variation right after bench variation is a good choice you don t need to move or set up any other equipment don t use old maxes for this program i recommend testing your maxes prior to this program in the giant set format that s how i tested all my variations prior to running this program since i didn t have any maxes for them this way if you re not accustomed to a high training density your weights won t be too brutally heavy then as you get used to it over this program you ll feel awesome smashing your amrap targets pick your assistance finishers to balance out the lengths of workouts the heavy assistance finishers will always follow emom work so these can be longer while i d recommend doing something around 10 minutes or less for the medium and light assistance since these follow your 4x8 and 5x5 main mover work don t go overboard with picking completely unique exercises for each giant sets you get decent variety via the rep ranges and the assistance finishers so you can cut down on analysis paralysis by repeating exercises between your variation main work or between days as i did with the kb swings in every workout final thoughts this program was awesome i made huge strength gains across the board adding 90 lbs to my pl total and a large amount of weight to several variations i m back above 20 bodyweight pullups again and finally hit a 3pl8 bench my squat and deadlift gained 30 pounds each and i m well on my way to finally set new lifetime prs on those lifts i think my conditioning got a lot better based on how much rest i needed between giant sets at the beginning of the program versus the end of the program thought that s a bit less quantifiable i d love to hear any ideas people have for a good metric to evaluate conditioning i also gained 7 lbs while increasing my arms by half an inch my legs by 0 75 inches and my chest by 1 5 inches while only gaining half an inch on my waist i m not sure how to measure shoulder size increase but they definitely got a lot bigger most of my shirts and jackets are quite a bit harder to get around my shoulders now i made major gains in strength size and conditioning while having a ton of fun i ll probably run this program again next winter when it s too cold icy for event training and i want to make my arms even bigger brian's programming is incredible and i thank him for putting out so many excellent programs for free anyone who's willing to work hard has a well-stocked gym and is willing to put in a decent amount of effort customizing it for your needs or just pay brian to do it for you he deserves the money could see great gains across a variety of dimensions running this program what s next in may i m going on a vacation to brazil to visit my friend and training partner who s recently moved there while i m there we re doing a strongman competition with a circus db ladder 45 50 55 65 kg deadlift ladder 160 180 220 250 kg log for reps 90 kg and hercules hold my goal will be to at least get the first 3 dbs and dls in the ladder those are above my current maxes but should be achievable with a decent peak now that it s spring i can train log consistently and should turn 90 kg from a max into a weight i can hit for a couple reps 5 would be a great number to hit i m going to run a frankenprogram using bits and pieces of mag-ort greg nuckols programs gzcl jacked and tan and various assistance finishers to prep for this all done in giant sets of course i d like to hang around 220 lbs for a while and recomp my waist has gotten a bit big for some of my pants and i d prefer not having to squint to see my abs in the mirror i'll do this by ending my hobbit-style second breakfast""]"

as much ice as you d like the more the better honestly this came out to 17 5 carbs for me with nearly 43 grams of protein it filled a 16oz cup with a small amount left over if the carb count is too high you can always split this and save the other half for the next day since it has no acids and will likely have minimal separation just add more ice blend and go i had a very long day of running around and only ate one thing all day and that was straight protein i was ending my day with nearly all of my carbs left over and a huge amount of protein i needed to reach not only did this taste good it satisfied whatever sweet craving i would have had by the end of the day helped me reach the majority of my protein goal kept me in ketosis and helped me get full i realize it s not for everyone but i ve worked really hard to try to adjust to this lifestyle without giving myself an eating disorder which proves hard every day because with an increase in protein comes the lack of appetite and suddenly it s 6pm and you haven t eaten anything all day in doing that i ve found really healthy productive and effective ways of eating that don t feel as restrictive as they actually are if anyone is missing their fix or wants to try something new i recommend giving this a shot happy eating everyone edit i am aware that this totals out to a large amount of carbohydrates for the average person on keto i acknowledge that twice what i also mentioned that i don t think people are grasping is that i know what s best for my body just like i m assuming the vast majority of you do with that i also know how many carbs i should consume to keep me losing fat and in ketosis it s really important for all of us to recognize that not everyone is living with the same guidelines as the next person some people require higher or lower carbs than what google recommends when people attempt to start this and that could be for a number of reasons for me i have always been successful on keto but the constant yo-yoing in my weight put my body into starvation and where i was once someone who could lose weight very quickly it was now taking months to see the same weight fall off after seeing a nutritionist and a huge series of evals from a number of specialists i learned what i need to be most effective in this lifestyle that means being flexible but mindful with my carb intake everyone s bodies and needs are different if this post recipe inspires you or is exactly what you needed i m so glad i could give that to you if this isn t for you then it s not for you adjust to your needs or ignore me all together but the messages and disrespect i m getting are insane if you lack self control don t buy use or eat the damn banana why do i even have to say that to you']"

kale powder nutricost and wanted to share what i've discovered so far and at the same time maybe learn some new ways of using it so far the main way i've been using it and it's working surprisingly well and allowing me to get the benefits of consuming more dark green leafy cruciferous vegetables is to stir it into certain scrambles that i've been making and it works well it actually adds to the flavor there's none of that gag me effect you often get with kale and other greens the scramble i've been basing this on is joe's special from original joe's recipes available online below is my variation on joe's special this joe's special scramble is wide open to variations and experimentation the primary ingredients i've been using in the scrambles are whole grains millet rice quinoa others plus pea protein powder plus a bunch of great spices szechuan seasoning freshly ground dried minced onion and garlic fresh ginger fresh garlic a bit of sweetener balsamic vinegar sweet basil sometimes italian herbs black pepper turmeric nutmeg or mace these add a very nice touch i learned to use them through researching original joe's recipes dried mushrooms a little peanut butter a little toasted sesame oil or olive oil i pressure cook it all and at the end stir and fluff then add a good-sized scoop one heaping tablespoon of the kale powder and stir it in it's great if anybody else has any ideas please post i believe in dark green leafy vegetables especially dark green leafy cruciferous vegetables and this is one way of getting more of them into one's diet i haven't tried adding the kale powder to smoothies yet but i'm going to try that and see if i can make actually be tasty and enjoyable"", ""wanting to incorporate more veggies and leafy greens help hi everyone me again i'm hoping to find some good recipes or methods of cooking different veggies i'm finding most of my meals have almost no veggies and my carbs are mostly coming from the little bits of dairy i consume i'm not wanting to go the carnivore route so i figured i'd come here i love roasting vegetables particularly broccoli and brussel sprouts but there's only so many times i can eat those though admittedly i haven't even been doing that much frozen veg is always an option but at least for what i can find its mostly more broccoli green beans or a carrot broccoli cauliflower mix frozen veggies have been a life saver and i'd totally love some ideas about that as well because right now i basically microwave drain dump in a tupperware with some salt and pepper and that's about it which ends up kinda flavorless i'd like to incorporate more veg and especially leafy greens but i'm just not a salad eater nor a smoothie drinker and adding cooked spinach to something like eggs or soup is typically not an enjoyable experience for me my solutions so far have been to coat veggies in olive oil salt and pepper and roast or in the case of leafy greens i've found i enjoy kale sauted in olive oil with garlic salt and pepper or i tried out swiss chard sauted in bacon grease with bits of crispy bacon mixed in and it was amazing but that was ages ago i really really need to make that again and i'm hoping for more variety than brussel sprouts broccoli kale and swiss chard how can i sneak veggies leafy greens in i'd love to become a salad person and i'd love to eat more produce i used to

330 in 2019 and ive had multiple ups and downs in the loss process although gw is somewhere in the 180-190 region ive also lost 100 lbs 70lbs x 2 50lbs x 2 before the 2019 peak and my tested rmr is about 500 cal per day lower than calculated value so i regain weight easily this is my third time committing to long term keto and so far im down around 30lbs in a little over 3 months which im very happy with i had previously gotten down to about 205 using a combination of keto exercise cico and fasting and i think ive had 2 x 40-50lb regains 1 x 30lb regains and 1 x 20lb regain in this process i had bumped back up close to 250 when i restarted keto a few months back the good im almost never hungry despite only eating around 1500-1750 cal per day and losing on average close to 2 pounds a week on average so far i have had far fewer sugar cravings since the first 3 weeks which i definitely attribute to almost completely cutting out fake sugars i have realized reliance on fake sugars is likely what led to keto being unsustainable for me other times and also drinking very minimally and mostly avoiding processed foods helps i was able to take a couple short holidays drop off keto and hop right back on with no difficulty im successfully wearing the slimmest pants i was wearing before during my weight loss again have been able to maintain all my lifts during this time despite the weight loss and body weight exercises like dips pushups pull-ups reps are up significantly i have a pretty busy life with work masters classes parenting and still doing social things and if anything i have more energy now despite taking in less energy the bad was hoping i would feel a benefit for adhd and that has not happened but my adhd isnt too bad i feel like my sleep quality has gotten worse and im waking up more it's not awful but im spending an extra 30-60 min in bed a day to compensate definitely when ive done hiit sessions i do have less burst energy overall which is expected foods macros i try to get at least 100g protein target 140ish usually probably 110-125 carbs under 30 rest in fat i do eat a lot of the same foods so i don't have to think about it which many would find boring my breakfast most mornings is a smoothie with unflavored casein whey flavored protein powders have tons of fake sugar btw cut with cocoa ceylon cinnamon and inulin 8oz water golden milk inspired spices that i blend turmeric ginger cayenne five-spice greens powder creatine frozen nespresso about 1 2 shot 1 4 cup frozen blueberries frozen cream 100 cal and maybe a little extra cream depending on hunger and around 5 drops of monk fruit extract my work lunch many days is frozen sliced grilled chicken about 40g protein worth and about 6oz frozen chopped spinach microwaved then i add about a tblsp evoo and some keto friendly sauce like avocado salsa buffalo sauce chimichuri etc cheese or meat sticks available for snack usually close to 100 cal beyond that most of my meals follow the protein veg sauce i like using the egg white cartons and i'll usually mix about 5 eggs worth of whites with 2 whole eggs in a shakshuka riced cauliflower broccoli florets and asparagus are also common veg for me right now im planning to do keto indefinitely could see experimenting with carb cycling at night if sleep gets worse"", ""how i successfully started keto my practical tips and what worked for me hey i ve noticed a lot of questions from people just starting on keto so i wanted to share exactly what i did when i first began my journey i have shared my journey in this community lost 35kg reversed diabetes bp and dropped 13 inches on keto all while cooking everything at home these practical steps helped me and hopefully they can help you too i kept it simple i didn t overwhelm myself with complex recipes or trying to recreate carb-heavy dishes i stuck to whole unprocessed foods like meat eggs low-carb veggies and healthy fats for example a typical meal for me was grilled chicken or chicken with curry chicken cutlets or chicken meatballs i tried to stick to one recipe for a week and the next week i tried the second one it saved my time and mental energy staying within limits i focused on keeping my daily carb intake very low under 20g to get into ketosis quickly water intake and electrolyte boost i drank plenty of water throughout the day more than 3-4 liters this helped prevent dehydration which can be a common issue in keto i also used electrolyte water made from lemon ginger and apple cider with pink salt daily necessory supplements i also took magnesium and potassium supplements which are necessary on keto if you are taking green leafy vegetable raw salad or making smoothies and nuts regularly then supplements are not necessary smoothies or salads and nuts fulfill your magnesium and potassium requirements i was taking vitamin d3 and k2 tablets daily avoiding processed foods i steered clear of keto-friendly processed products instead i stuck to whole foods like meat fish eggs nuts and low-carb vegetables this kept my diet clean and helped me avoid hidden carbs instead of using processed oil i used mustard oil only or desi ghee made from butter i could olive oil on keto but i didn't as it is a little bit expensive exercise i started walking for 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening this also helped me lose weight quickly intermittent fasting i started a keto diet combined with intermittent fasting i fasted for 16 hours and had 2 meals within an 8-hour window during the fasting period i drank electrolyte water and herbal tea but refrained from eating anything it was difficult at first but i eventually got used to it i hope this will help a lot in your keto journey whether you're losing weight or reversing your diseases if you need further help on this journey i'll guide you as much as i can"", 'giving myself new ground rules for starting keto again long post just thought i should share this because i thought it might help some people if they re wondering what they could do to lose weight faster or why they might be struggling to lose not everything is gonna be applicable here to everybody of course but it could help some people background about me and my personal keto journeys in summer 2020 and spring of 2021 i had great success doing my first and second rounds of keto i m female early 20s 5 1 and before the first time doing keto i was about 160lbs after i finished keto the second time i was around 125lbs and my body actually stayed at around 130-135lbs without any dieting both times i did keto i was only on the diet for short periods of time and the weight just flew off of me with a combination of being in school or doing work where i was standing moving all day but then i go pregnant in the summer of 2021 and my body has been a mess ever since after baby i had some issues with my thyroid that caused massive weight gain and at my heaviest i was about 190lbs actually getting close to 200lbs briefly which is mind boggling for me to think about i m currently around 170lbs and the weight just slowly came off when i got off maternity leave and went to work again where i was standing moving all day i tried and failed a handful of times to get back into keto because previously it had been so easy imagine my frustration when the weight just would not budge and then recently i ve realized that there s a lot of things i need to do differently this time around on keto if i want it to work for me my ultimate goal is to be about 120lbs and lean muscular but my more reasonable goal is to get to around 130lbs by the time i m about 140lbs i know i ll already feel much happier and healthier than i am now i ve just come off a 3 day water fast primarily for spiritual reasons but i also decided to take this as an opportunity to start keto again but to do it properly for me personally here is my personal list of ground rules that i think is really going to help me see the results i want 1 limit dairy and absolutely no cheese since having baby there s just something about my body metabolism and cheese that nulls any sort of progress from keto for me i m not lactose intolerant but cheese just backs me up so badly in the bathroom when i m on keto i used it as a crutch a lot for any of my cravings during the times i tried to do keto after having my son i know now that it ll just make it not even worth it for me to do keto cuz i just won t see any progress if i do 2 no keto approved sweets desserts either store made or from a recipe at home there just seems to be something about the sweeteners that sets me back and again makes it not even worth it for me to do keto anyway cuz i just don t see any progress when i eat these things 3 intermittent fasting for sure and hopefully omad will be part of my routine this time around but i will leave room for some keto snacks that i will list later i ve been doing intermittent fasting without keto for a bit more than a month now and it s become pretty easy so i think that will help my eating window has been between 1pm-9pm and if i do omad i think i ll just have supper at home around 6-7pm 4 stick to a basic meal that i can make and eat easily everyday and make small changes to so i don t get bored so it ll be - a protein like chicken beef or pork seasoned obviously and maybe with a bit of tzatziki for some extra fat - two strips of bacon - green veg like broccoli brussel sprouts asparagus etc cooked in a lot of butter or coconut oil -pork rinds with half a salted avocado to dip it in - i can also have a bio steel electrolyte drink even though it has stevia it thankfully doesn t seem to set me back or hurt my stomach but things like zevia soda do some gnarly things to my guts and also give me wicked calf cramps so those are gonna be a no for me - if necessary for satiety additional nutrients i also have a keto smoothie recipe that i can make if i m not feeling satisfied by all that recipe not exact measurements cuz i always just eye-ball it 1 tbsp each of ground hemp flax chia roughly 1 cup of goat milk or low carb nut milk probably half a cup spinach 1 4 cup or so of mixed frozen berries 1 scoop genuine health brand fermented organic vegan protein -vanilla flavour this seems to be the only protein powder i can have that doesn t 1 rip my guts apart like premier brand does and 2 isn t disgusting like the vegan pure brand i personally feel like i really need to have consistency in this form of knowing exactly what i m going to eat because having too many options gives me decision paralysis plus then i know exactly what to buy in the store and don t blow a bunch of money on stuff that s just gonna sit in the freezer or go bad some people may not like this idea but for me i think this is the only way i can see the results i want quickly i m not aiming to do keto as a long term lifestyle diet it s just something that i know has worked for me in the past to drop weight quickly and usually it stays off for awhile afterward too as long as i remain moderately active and mindful of what i m eating 5 heavily limit any snacks but i have a good list to go to if i feel i need it - medium boiled eggs - poached eggs with hollandaise and a splash of valentina sauce - smoked salmon - shrimp fried in butter and seasoned with steak spice huge dopamine hit in my brain from this one lol - kale chips - bacon these are all great keto things that seem to scratch that reward centre itch in my brain when i want to treat myself i also have a few other keto meal options i can make if i m feeling really bored from the daily one i listed earlier 6 having a cheat day goal in mind christmas is coming up and i am not gonna cheat once until then i am so determined about this and i think seeing that i could do a 3 day fast with little issue will be a great motivator for me to not fall off the wagon 7 after i get to a point where i m happy with my results i am going to get involved in some sort of physical activity as a hobby i don t like going to the gym and i don t like exercising i m just not the kind of person who can motivate myself solo at the gym but when i do some sort of class it makes it fun for me i did tae kwon do as a kid and i think i will do that again the reason i want to lose weight through keto first is because i am incredibly out of shape now and i don t think i would enjoy it as much now as i would when i m not winded after 2 mins of running when i did keto the first two times successfully i had tons of energy and i felt so physically strong so i know that will help when i start exercising more i also don t think i want to do keto while exercising because i think i ll just lose the weight i want and then use the exercise to keep it off instead of having to do both anyway that was a super long post so i m done for now but if anyone has any more suggestions for what helped you lose weight quickly then i am all ears']"
