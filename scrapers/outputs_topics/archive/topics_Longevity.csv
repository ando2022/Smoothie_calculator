dismiss it i m 5 2 woman who has lost just over 100lbs 48kgs and kept it off for five years now the reason i have been able to keep the weight off for so long is absolutely credited to exercise firstly irregardless of weight exercise is absolutely essential for longevity being fat but fit is shown to be better for you than being slim and lazy cardio is for heart health strength training is for fighting disease now to talk about weight loss the equation is cico - exercise is the co yes you do burn a majority of your calories at rest but exercise actually makes your resting calories burned increase the more muscle you have the more calories you burn at rest because it takes more energy to have muscle than to have fat which means even after a weight lifting session where you may have burned less than 100 calories you re going to be burning more just sitting on your ass watching tv than you would if you didn t exercise running and biking are incredibly effective calorie burners everyone on here hypes up walking and they should but if you can switch to a bike or even run you can burn infinitely more calories than by walking walking is great but it doesn t build muscle unless you re hiking up hills with packs on it is still incredible but it takes a long time and the reward is often minimal for how long it takes one problem with losing weight without exercise is that when you hit plateaus you have to typically cut your calories down again this is a constant cycle people talk about being on diets for the rest of their lives here but it s super hard to eat 1400 calories for the rest of your life with exercise i can eat 2100 per day and half the time i don t even hit that another issue is that when people shred all their weight just by diet alone they lose fat and muscle it s one of the main reasons we see people hitting their goal weights and while they are skinny they can be skinny fat slim but still with a higher body fat percentage muscle will make you look smaller and healthier exercise is really hard to get started with the learning curve is really steep once you re about six months to a year in it becomes routine and usually actually becomes fun it doesn t have to be perfect just consistent i see so many people yo-yo dieting here because they lose the weight by simply eating less and then can t maintain the low calories for ever those who exercise regularly with intensity are the ones to keep it off long term it s a lifestyle change not a food change it s changing your sedentary obesogenic lifestyle to that of a fit thin persons lifestyle food is just one part of the lifestyle', 'eating food from publicly traded large companies just asked an ai why most food in my pantry usa contains high-fructose corn syrup and wow this is what i got larger long-established companies tend to use more processed non-organic ingredients and chemicals compared to smaller independent companies that can be attributed to a combination of economic operational and market-driven factors economies of scale and cost pressures large companies often prioritize cost efficiency to maintain profitability as they scale using processed ingredients synthetic preservatives and cheaper non-organic materials reduces production costs enabling them to offer competitive prices and maintain high profit margins smaller companies with less pressure to compete on price can focus on quality and niche markets often prioritizing organic or natural ingredients to differentiate themselves public companies and shareholder pressure when companies go public they face intense pressure from shareholders to maximize profits and show consistent growth on the stock market this can lead to cost-cutting measures such as replacing high-quality organic ingredients with cheaper processed alternatives or adding shelf-stabilizing chemicals to extend product life these changes boost margins but often compromise ingredient quality independent companies typically privately owned are less beholden to such external financial pressures and can prioritize product integrity over short-term gains supply chain and scale challenges large companies require massive consistent supplies of ingredients to meet demand which can be difficult to source organically due to limited availability and higher costs processed or non-organic ingredients are often more readily available cheaper and have longer shelf lives making them attractive for large-scale production small companies with smaller production runs can more easily source local or organic ingredients without the same logistical constraints market positioning and consumer expectations big companies often cater to a broad price-sensitive consumer base leading them to formulate products that prioritize affordability consistency and shelf life over quality additives like artificial flavors colors or preservatives enhance taste appearance and longevity aligning with mainstream consumer expectations early in their lifecycle companies may focus on quality to establish their brand as they grow and mature the focus often shifts to optimizing processes and reducing costs to stay competitive this can lead to reformulations that favor processed ingredients smaller newer companies are often still in the innovation phase emphasizing quality to carve out a market niche a study from the journal of food science noted that large-scale food production often relies on additives to maintain consistency across batches especially for products distributed globally posts online frequently highlight consumer frustration with big brands reformulating products with cheaper ingredients like replacing sugar with high-fructose corn syrup or natural flavors with artificial ones small independent brands often market themselves as clean label or organic with certifications like usda organic or non-gmo project verified which resonate with consumers seeking transparency why small companies offer better ingredients small independent companies often operate with shorter more transparent supply chains allowing them to source higher-quality ingredients cater to niche markets that value organic non-gmo or minimally processed foods avoid the same financial pressures as publicly traded companies giving them flexibility to prioritize quality over cost build brand loyalty through trust and authenticity which incentivizes maintaining high standards', ""the common principles of health - a synthesis of reading 32 different nutrition books and 30 different papers because i am a dork who has been interested in nutrition for years i was curious how much overlap there was between nutrition advice across the medical scientific and consumer self-help spectrum so i went through and read a whole bunch of books 1 on the subject government guidelines across the globe as well as a number of scientific articles meta-analysis editorials etc and wrote down all the general principles they suggested then i ran that through chatgpt 4omni and asked it to give me a list of the most common principles from most-often repeated to least the answers were not surprising turns out common sense really is common 2 i suspect a lot of people will read these and say yeah no duh but it was a fun exercise for me and it increased my confidence in the general intelligence of humanity and the value of the scientific method below is the list of healthy habits organized by categories diet principles eating principles living practices and arranged in order from the greatest impact 3 to the least so if you want to try adopting any of these principles into your life start at the top of each list and work your way down healthy diet principles focus on whole minimally processed foods avoid refined carbohydrates and highly processed foods getting the majority of your calories in the form of from ultra-refined carbohydrates fats proteins has a very different effect on the body than minimally-processed carbohydrates fats proteins after a certain level of refinement the body doesn't like it highly-refined calories can be hyper-palatable and trigger the evolved binge response if you eat refined foods choose ones you would have found hundreds of years ago masa stone ground whole grain wheat flour rolled oats cheese etc cook foods gently to make them more nutritious cooked foods are easier to digest more nutrients absorbed but too much cooking can destroy heat-sensitive nutrients temperature time heat-sensitive nutrient loss choose fast gentle cooking methods microwaving pressure steaming steaming pressure boiling boiling slow cooking avoid or moderate highly calorie-dense and nutrient-poor foods oil and sugar have very little in the way of nutrients per calorie eliminate or greatly reduce added sugars and oils use as little added oil as possible to make food taste good save the fats in your diet for whole plant foods reduce or eliminate added sugars eat a variety of vegetables include vegetables in every meal eat a variety of colors every day the different colors red orange yellow green purple all indicate different vitamins and phytonutrients that are beneficial eat mushrooms onions garlic and greens regularly make sure you have cruciferous vegetables regularly limit or avoid animal products factory farming is terrible for the environment there are other ways to get the nutrients needed than killing animals the vitamins you think you need from animal products b12 you can get from plant foods where the animals get it if you choose to eat animals consider them a condiment or special occasion food replacing animal protein with plant protein legumes for meat has shown to improve health and longevity plant proteins are the healthiest fish proteins are second healthiest fowl proteins are the third healthiest red meat proteins beef pig deer etc are the least healthy most of the longest-lived humans in blue zones eat very little meat e g 40g a day average or less eat fruits daily include whole fruits in your diet avoid dried fruits and fruit juices make the bulk of your calories whole grains and starches base your diet around filling starches like whole grains beans corn and potatoes use salt and sugar in moderation reduce salt and sugar during cooking and apply at the table as needed salt and sugar crystals that directly touch your tongue are the ones you experience eat nuts and seeds in moderation include nuts and seeds but in moderation eat legumes daily eat beans and pulses daily for protein and extra fiber these are very good for your gut bacteria include flax seeds other seeds daily flax is a great source of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids seeds contain all sorts of different antioxidants and phytonutrients as well as healthy fats use spices and herbs for flavor and health benefits turmeric cumin and garlic all have anti-inflammatory properties nutritional yeast has health benefits based on their beta glucan content and are often fortified with b12 regularly include fermented foods kimchi sauerkraut pickles etc are good for your gut fermented veggies also are a great way to include salt for flavor while also adding extra health benefits ensure adequate vitamin and mineral intake consider a multivitamin for insurance vitamin d is basically required selenium likely if you're of european descent b12 supplementation if you're a vegan alcohol in moderation if at all if you do drink drink socially all the major benefits antioxidants you can get from grapes alcohol is a diuretic drink 1 cup of water for every 1 unit of alcohol to avoid hangovers healthy eating principles eat when hungry until comfortably full listen to your body s hunger cues if you're hungry it's ok to eat if you think you're hungry it's ok to eat eat meals undistracted and slowly focus on eating without distractions take time to enjoy your meals hydrate well drink plenty of water daily 2 7-3 7 liters per day preloading a meal with 1-2 cups of cold water can fill you up faster and increase burn rate of calories consider intermittent fasting fasting for at least 12 hours a day has health benefits this includes sleeping fasting more can reduce calorie intake as a side-effect which could be beneficial if you want to lose weight listen to your body ignoring hunger signals constantly can raise stress hormone levels and potentially reduce beneficial hormone levels e g testosterone front-load your calories eating more earlier in the day means your body can use those readily-accessible calories for work and play unused calories near the end of the day tend to get stored as fat until needed later healthy daily practices moderate exercise regularly aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily moderate means you are breathing harder and faster than you would be walking slowly incorporate strength training builds muscle and bone density do whatever kind you enjoy but body weight exercise pushups squats pullups is enough for major benefits incorporate flexibility training yoga stretching notes 1 i started by reading through everything at red pen reviews and then i moved onto the best-seller list for diet and nutrition on the nyt and amazon 2 what i did find surprising is how rarely calorie counting was mentioned as a healthy habit it was associated with weight loss in the short term but most of the meta-analysis showed that over the long term most people gain the weight back so it wasn't considered a general solution for health and longevity i've excluded it from the list because it was way low down on the list of principles that gpt spit out and because it feels like a thing one can do on top of these habits but the habits can also be practiced without writing down what you ate and how many calories were in them 3 i use the term impact to mean basically a lot of studies showed significant and strong evidence in observational cohort metaanalysis that doing this is good for you""]"

the skill and the strength in broad terms the skill component is a phase in which you teach your body to acquire the correct positioning of the scapula relative to the rest of your body and the strength component is a phase in which you build strength in the relative muscle groups the skill component is highly specialised meaning that you are using exercises or movement patterns that are generally not found in any other training modalities more on this later and the strength portion uses a combination of standard compound movements and specialised exercises to build strength through ranges of motion specific to the skill bodyweight training on the other hand is a selection of basic compound movements such as the pull up dip push up squat and inverted row which can potentially be loaded to progress now that we have those two separate i would also like to mention that my kettlebell training has solely been within hardstyle which i feel is most conducive to being combined with calisthenics training gs is a whole sport unto itself and whilst i'm sure it could be programmed alongside some calisthenics or bodyweight training the training volume and adaptations needed to excel at gs is greatly in opposition to calisthenics why should a kettlebell athlete consider calisthenics bodyweight training or vice versa what benefits does each modality offer first let's establish the most important factor - convenience it's very common for people training kettlebells and or calisthenics bodyweight training modalities to train at home people need convenience if they are to be able to fit the equipment needed in their living spaces barbells and machines take up a lot of room so having smaller and fewer pieces of equipment is really important moving on for the kettlebell athlete upper body vertical pull and push - truly the only movement pattern that kettlebell training is missing is upper body vertical plain pull ups and dips can be a welcome addition to any kettlebell program and are easily scaled or overloaded via bands concentric or adding weight to a belt respectively the rings - a unique piece of equipment and one of the most convenient form factors that provides a huge amount of variety the sheer number of upper body exercises that can be performed with the rings is legion and the variety they can add to any program can be hugely beneficial quick tip do not take pushing exercises on rings for granted the instability when above the rings means you must work slowly and cautiously towards any vertical or horizontal pushing movement pulling movements however can be accessed immediately and the free movement of the rings can actually be a huge benefit as they allow free scapula and wrist movement when compared to the closed kinetic chain of a bar straight arm strength - here we start getting into the more unique benefits of the calisthenics straight arm strength can be defined as any pattern of movement in which the elbows remain in full extension throughout commonly the high level calisthenics skills such as your levers and planches require the elbow to remain stationary whilst the fulcrum of the shoulder joint moves through a range of motion this type of movement puts extreme pressure on the connective tissue of the elbow usually the biceps tendon and scapulas and without correct preparation and pre-habilitation can result in serious injuries a great way to get a sense of straight arm strength is to get into a push up position fully protract the scapula and externally rotate your arms and gently lean forward this is called a planche lean you will immediately start to feel pressure on the biceps tendon as it works hard to stabilise the elbow joint some nice progressions include all the support positions on the rings with the rings turned out as far as possible just make sure to stabilise the scapula by depressing and protracting as hard as possible arms isolation work - whilst it is completely possible to perform isolation exercises for your arms with kettlebells it's just way more convenient with calisthenics the various curling and triceps extension exercises available with a bar and especially with rings are a worthy contender when compared to the equivalent kettlebell version scapula isolation work - calisthenics offers unparalleled ways to directly train the scapula the scapula is the foundation for all upper body exercises and encompasses a huge range of muscles from the traps serratus rotater cuff and many more one of its role is to stabilise the shoulder blades relative to the rib cage and shoulder girdle so a weak or poor connection to the scapula can result in any number of problems and injuries being albe to directly train the scapula in every plane of movement with gravity acting in every direction hanging inverted in a support hold in a plank etc will greatly improve strength and upper body health interoception - something slightly more conceptual but definitely worth mentioning is the ability to become closely connected to your body with calisthenics bodyweight training learning to control a load through space via weight training has huge real world application but having the ability to manipulate your own body through space cannot be understated we are not perfect beings we're clumsy and uncoordinated at times and having a strong connection to the naturalistic movement patterns of your body can literally save your life in certain situations relative strength - something all calisthenics athletes understand is that having a lower body weight will make calisthenics easier it just makes sense knowing that the load you are moving is governed by how much you weigh calisthenics athletes will strive to have as low body fat as possible to make up for this however the inverse is also true in lifting external weights often we are resisting against the weight especially in things like kettlebell swings so having more weight to resist against this will prove beneficial fun skills - honestly this isn't hugely important and highly individualised but learning calisthenics skills is incredibly fun and fulfilling getting that first handstand hold or your first lever skill is one of the most rewarding things you can achieve when pursuing calisthenics and for the calisthenics athlete the hinge - the hip hinge movement pattern is notably missing in calisthenics bodyweight training there is just no good way to overload the hip hinge without weights for a completely balanced system of training no muscle groups can be left out so it is vital that some kind of weighted hinging pattern must be included in a calisthenics bodyweight program it's non-negotiable especially when you consider how vital the lower back and hamstrings are in their contribution to overall health and injury prevention especially as we age progressive overload for lower body exercises - continuing from the previous point about hinging lower body training in general is not easily overloaded yes it could be seen as a benefit to have smaller amounts of lower body mass when pursuing calisthenics skills especially levers but considering we use our legs in real world applications far more than our upper bodies neglecting not only the most used but also the largest muscle groups in the body will have detrimental effects to overall health as we get older i live by the phrase to only train half of your body is to only experience half of what life has to offer rotational work - another missing component of calisthenics bodyweight training is spinal rotation it is hugely beneficial to the structural integrity and overall health of our spine things like bridge rotations and around the world leg raises can help but have high points of entry so it's worth considering the kettlebell alternatives a programming that includes moving the spine in the rotational plain through a large range of motion as well as resisting spinal rotation will fill in all the gaps here so including windmills and single arm swings are well worth considering axial loading spinal erectors - yet another missing component in calisthenics bodyweight training modalities is the ability to load from the top down this is another hugely important aspect of spine health and overall longevity or improved health span so including goblet or racked versions of basic lower body compounds can be really beneficial here progressive overload for overhead pressing movements - it's notoriously difficult to progress in overhead pressing movements with calisthenics bodyweight training first off the point of entry for pike push ups is incredibly high and secondly handstand push ups require a massive skill component pretty much every high level calisthenics coach online is in agreeance that working the strength and skill component of a handstand push up simultaneously is conducive to reliable progression the fact that kettlebell weights are scalable down to the single kilogram will certainly help build towards the pike push up and further progress strength when bridging the gap between a pike push up and handstand push up i have also found as the kettlebell sits on the outside of the arm when performed with the right technique external shoulder rotation elbows kept to the front of the body as opposed to coming out sideways the kettlebell press is quite reflective of the movement in a pike handstand push up greater grip strength - something i have found in my own training which may not be reflective of others is that my grip strength increased hugely when using kettlebells something about stopping the bell flying away from you whilst using a more hook-like grip while performing heavy single arm swings is far more conducive to increasing forearm strength than simply hanging from a bar explosive or 'ballistic' strength in the hips - upper body explosive strength is easily trainable in calisthenics bodyweight systems - muscle ups clapping push ups and various other exercises offer a great way to train this explosive lower body training with calisthenics bodyweight however offers a single exercise - jumping squats the hips connect all the largest muscle groups in the body and can generate the most strength through their movement therefore training heavy swings and other such 'ballistic' hinging movements will teach you how to generate the most force or power and has huge carry over to a plethora of real world and sports applications cardio cardio cardio - another sadly neglected part of calisthenics bodyweight training is cardio almost all kettlebell programs include an element of high intensity cardio via the way of complexes emoms etc whilst this can be replicated through things like sprints the additional quality of full body coordination whilst experiencing aerobic fatigue can have huge benefits for overall health health span and carry over to sports for both a greater exercise selection - without bogging yourself down in 'paralysis by over analysis' in which you fret mindlessly about the most effective exercise for the specific adaptation or switch up exercises so frequently that you miss focussed work towards progression having a greater exercise selection is great in circumstances where you are plateauing in specific movement patterns stopped progressing in your push up movements switch to floor press for your next mesocycle kettlebell rows not hitting like they used to try inverted rows having a larger selection of exercises can also be incredibly helpful in working around injuries for example when i had a shoulder tendinopathy and i couldn't press overhead at all turkish get ups came to the rescue and allowed me to maintain my overhead pressing strength completely whilst the injury healed mobility training - it can't be overstated how important having large active ranges of motion are over the course of our life and health span the options offered by loaded mobility training can be woven into most programs and having access to strength within larger rages of motion will also open up a whole new world of skills in calisthenics unilateral training - something both modalities offer is unilateral training as previously mentioned we are not perfect beings and having more coordination and strength when off balance can be life changing upper body calisthenics movements such as archer or single arm push pull progressions plus single kettebell loaded exercises such as single kettebell racked squats or single leg single bell rdls will teach you to better control your spine core when off balance reaping huge real world benefits to conclude it's fair to say that calisthenics is an incomplete training modality it's impossible to progressively overload certain movement patterns i e lower body to the same extent as others i e upper body saying this all calisthenics athletes should consider some form of weight training i'm not saying kettlebells are the best answer here it's wholly dependent on goals but they could certainly be the most convenient or accessible and a final point for kettlebell athletes it's worth considering the unique benefits that calisthenics offer in terms of upper body strength connective tissue health and your relative strength-to-bodyweight ratio how can you train both modalities simultaneously a main way i am going to differ from u prowland12 post is i am not going to give you examples of how to structure your training this is for two reasons - this type of training is highly specialised and require a depth of knowledge that would require mountains of information being dumped into a single post and i would like to keep this fairly concise but please message me if you would like some specifics second each person has different goals and can allocate different amounts of time to each goal the average teenager with no responsibilities is going to have much more time to dedicate to training than the average adult with kids and a full time job plus everyones program will look completely different depending on their goals it just feels counter productive to say 'here is an exact programming method you can follow which will help you reach your goals' - progression is never linear in this fashion and i feel we should all take it upon ourselves to be experimenters with our own body all that said here are my main tips - choose your goals wisely - as combining the two modalities can cause conflicts in goals it's best to choose fewer overall long term training aims a good guide for a beginner would be to choose a single goal within each of the 4 main movement patters i e 1 push 1 pull 1 squat and 1 hinge goal conflicting goals are ones where the adaptations desired perhaps doesn't work towards the same end result - i e going for the planche will mean a whole lot of horizontal pushing work so simultaneously trying to pb your overhead press might be conflicting or trying to grow mass your legs whilst going for the front lever might extend the time it takes to achieve the front lever organising workouts to priorities the exercises that work towards your most desired goals will be really important here exercise order matters - understanding the effect of local muscle fatigue and central nervous system fatigue during a single bout of exercise is key to programming for specific goals exercises placed later in the workout will be more difficult to progress due to the accumulated fatigue so understanding how your body might react to certain periodisation methodologies is key to attaining long term goals getting enough practice in - when we talk about acquiring skills frequency is the most important factor acquiring skills encompasses the ability to perform that skill safely which should always be a priority when learning a new exercise getting enough frequency in a single movement pattern can be challenging when spreading your practice out over 2 modalities with multitudes of fundamental movements after all we only have a certain capacity for recovery so it's stupid to think we can learn all the movement patterns and skills of even a single modality at the same time train smart - don't try take on too many skills at once especially when it comes to kettlebell training learn to master one at a time and you will see much better long term development and safer practice step loading - a form of progressive overload seen in both kettlebell and calisthenics bodyweight training that relies on increases in volume prior to increases in intensity it's great that this is seen across both modalities as it allows for very similar structure to progressive overload between exercises in each modality and can make structuring your programming much easier full body workouts - full body workouts can be an effective way to get frequent practice however due to the fatigue generated over a single bout are not great for long term development progress will stagnate over time due to not being able to get enough volume stimulation in a single movement pattern muscle group as your body adapts over time it's also with considering the interference effect in which certain adaptations can blunt others if performed in a single bout of exercise hence why once you are out of the beginner stage and are proficient at the basic skills and movement patters it may be a good idea to move on to concurrent training - this programming methodology relies on seeking specific adaptations on separate days through a micro mesocycle this could be set up as such over 4 days of training in a 7 day microcycle note this is my current programming - day 1 - upper body strength focus day 2 rest day 3 full body cardio endurance focus day 4 rest day 5 upper body strength focus day 6 lower body strength focus day 7 rest change your technique to reflect your goals - i feel like this might be controversial to the purists out there much like i described with the overhead press earlier in the post technique can be changed to better suite goals first it's important to distinguish the differences between form and technique form is a non-negotiable aspect of any exercise it outlines the safest way to perform any given exercise e g for a kettlebell swing hinging not squatting neutral spine head and neck neutral etc technique on the the other hand changes the movement pattern with the intension of emphasising a certain adaptation gained from the exercise without compromising form for a kettlebell swing this could be something as little as a wider stance to something more unusual as adding a hard scapula retraction at the top of the movement to get more back 'gains' i use this all over the place in conjugation with my training goals and will be happy to share some specifics i hope you enjoyed this post i didn't realise how long it would be but i'm happy to expand further in the comments about any of the concepts or do separate posts all together for deeper-dives into specific topics""]"

i'm new to this sub but i usually frequent r caliberstrong r macrofactor and r homegym at least when it comes to health fitness dieting i wanted to write a post with my experience and strategies while losing about 40 pounds in the past year here's my general wl progress october 2022 246 lbs 40 bf october 2023 202 lbs 23 bf i got a dexa scan in october 2023 so i know my rough bf i used this plus my weight loss to estimate my october 2022 bf my goal is about 185 lbs at 12-15 bf but i won't get there without a ton of hard work and probably 18 more months anyway here are the strategies not tips and tricks that i used to lose weight and also some recommendations aim for 0 5 - 1 0 bw loss per week if you're 250 lbs this means 1 25 - 2 50 lbs of weight loss per week or 5 - 10 lbs of weight loss per month you can generally make this diet change without putting too much stress on your body and mind at higher bodyweights you can probably lose more at lower bodyweights you might struggle with the top end and need to focus on 0 5 bw loss per week why is this my recommendation for one they're nice even numbers though somewhat arbitrary the real answer is 0 5 - 1 0 bw reduction per week often leads to a sustainable diet with healthy eating habits i've generally maintained a good relationship with food over the past year i'm not afraid to eat out though i may not drink a ton of beer if my friends want to go to a bar maintaining a healthy relationship with food is super important losing weight at this rate also may improve the odds that you don't need skin loss surgery because you'll lose weight more slowly start a resistance training program you don't need to start a bodybuilding or powerlifting program but try and go to the gym 2-3x per week and lift for 30-60 minutes do a full-body session don't push particularly hard unless you've been lifting for awhile when you lose weight there's a potential for muscle loss lifting weights helps reduce muscle loss you may also develop muscles you've never used before which can help with back aches as an example finally lifting weights can help you burn extra calories though it's probably way less than you think i estimate each of my 60-minute gym sessions burns 200 calories be very sensitive to diet fatigue diet fatigue is simply the mental and physical effects of dieting often negative of course there are positive effects as well but that's not fatigue each person experiences diet fatigue differently from what the symptoms are to their magnitude to how quickly etc for me personally after 7-9 weeks my diet fatigue gets really bad and i need to take a maintenance break here are my diet fatigue symptoms 1 fixation on food - i'm always thinking about food no matter what time of day 2 i'm always hungry - i could have a 5 000 calorie cheat day and still feel hungry 3 trouble sleeping - i can't sleep because i'm hungry as you are dieting note your diet fatigue symptoms and plan accordingly there's nothing wrong with dieting for say 3-4 months and losing 6 5 - 13 of your bw and then spending 1-2 months at maintenance eat at your tdee or total daily energy expenditure to neither gain nor lose weight this can help reduce diet fatigue so you can execute another fat loss phase in addition if you've been dieting for 3 months and you aren't losing weight like you used to you feel like you're doing everything perfectly and it's gotten harder or you're just miserable you might want to take a maintenance break as you lose weight your tdee may decrease due to reduction in neat non-exercise activity thermogenesis - this could be a 50 calorie impact it could be as high as 350 calories depending on the individual maintenance breaks will eliminate your diet fatigue and can often get your tdee back to healthy levels my tdee is usually 2850 - 3000 calories day when i'm deep in the diet it will drop to 2650 - 2750 to maintain my expected rate of weight loss that means i need to drop calories by 200 - 350 per day or add more liss low impact steady state cardio e g walking combine working harder with diet fatigue and losing weight can become impossible pay attention to activity workout signals and systemic fatigue this section is for those people who are doing a lot of high intensity cardio like running or weight lifting pay attention to your systemic fatigue systemic fatigue is overall fatigue that you feel while doing these activities usually tiredness but also joint aches and sometimes mental disposition everyone at some point or another will experience systemic fatigue when running a weightlifting program otherwise you could push hard everyday for eternity and become infinitely strong the best example of systemic fatigue is actually from my lower body workout this week i was doing 3 sets of barbell squats and i failed the last rep in the last set due to muscle failure pushing a heavy compound lift to failure generates a ton of systemic fatigue a day later my entire body is completely wiped out unloading the dishwasher was super tiring that was friday now its sunday and i feel about 90 better basically listen to your body if you're running and your knees hurt take a break from running or get a coach if you're lifting and you cannot progress your lifts anymore or you're extremely tired in unexpected areas e g doing a chest workout and your legs get tired it's time to take it easy for a week or two and recover this is important for longevity i forgot who said it but today's workout is 50 focused on the lifts and 50 focused on tomorrows workout that's how you develop consistency and consistency is how you make progress the same goes for dieting use an app tracker to help i used myfitnesspal for awhile with success i've also used chronometer when i ran keto i don't recommend it my fasted blood sugar levels dropped to 46 now i use macrofactor it doesn't yell at me if i overeat it also does its best to estimate your tdee over time so you can adjust your caloric intake i also use caliber to track my workout progress anyway that's it hope this helps people if you want to see more about my progress i recently posted a 1-year wl update just

the hype hey everyone this is a post for people who are new to supplements or just starting to explore the world of health optimization i wrote this with the help of chatgpt but it reflects my own thoughts and experience too there s a lot of noise out there this is meant to bring some structure and make things easier to understand let s break it down 1 what are supplements supplements are compounds nutrients molecules plant extracts or amino acids that we take to support health they re not magic and they re not meant to replace medications or a healthy lifestyle but they can be useful depending on your goals some are essential for life like vitamin d some are naturally made in your body like creatine or coq10 and some are found in food or plants like egcg from green tea or curcumin from turmeric they re used for different reasons preventing deficiencies improving performance slowing aging or protecting organs 2 categories of supplements there are many ways to classify supplements but this is a simple breakdown i like a essential nutrients these are vitamins minerals and amino acids your body needs to survive you can get them from food but some people need more examples vitamin d magnesium b12 zinc iodine omega-3s b endogenous compounds produced by the body these are substances your body makes but production declines with age or illness supplementing may help support energy brain health or aging examples creatine coq10 carnitine alpha-lipoic acid glutathione nad boosters c bioactive compounds not essential but beneficial these aren t required for life but your body can still use them in powerful ways many are found in plants or fermented foods examples egcg from green tea curcumin from turmeric sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts ergothioneine from mushrooms astaxanthin from algae or seafood d herbal or traditional extracts often used in traditional medicine systems like tcm or ayurveda can contain many active compounds some are well-researched others less so examples berberine ginseng ashwagandha rhodiola milk thistle some of these are potent and shouldn t always be taken every day or without understanding dosage and context 3 supplement safety what to know some supplements are incredibly safe safer than salt caffeine or even aspirin others can interact with meds or build up in the body relatively safe for most people magnesium especially glycinate creatine taurine coq10 pqq ergothioneine vitamin d in proper amounts fish oil if stored well use caution or talk to a doctor first preformed vitamin a high-dose iron if not deficient copper yohimbine kava large doses of herbal extracts or poorly regulated brands note always tell your doctor if you re taking supplements especially if you re on blood thinners have kidney liver issues are pregnant or are managing a condition 4 why most doctors don t recommend supplements it s not because they re bad it s often because doctors weren t trained in this area medical school focuses on diagnosing and treating disease not optimizing health or preventing long-term decline with nutritional compounds and since most supplements aren t fda-approved as treatments doctors may feel unsure or cautious about recommending them especially when there s a lack of large-scale human data that said this is not about choosing supplements instead of medication you take meds when you need them but supplements might help with prevention performance and long-term resilience depending on your situation 5 what s the evidence behind supplements some people say there s no evidence that s not true there is evidence but it depends on what you re looking for there are multiple types of evidence mechanistic studies what it does at the cellular level animal studies often showing longevity or disease delay clinical trials yes real trials on things like garlic creatine omega-3s vitamin d small-scale human studies especially in newer compounds epidemiological data population-based trends systematic reviews meta-analyses combining all the above no single study proves everything but when the mechanism the animal data and the human results all point in the same direction and the compound is safe some people like me think it s worth betting on 6 example supplements worth knowing about just a few of the well-researched beginner-friendly ones creatine muscle brain and mitochondrial support very safe very studied vitamin d3 immune system bones mental health low levels are common vitamin k2 mk-7 helps keep calcium out of your arteries and in your bones taurine linked to longevity in animals supports heart and metabolic health coq10 especially useful if you re on statins or want mitochondrial support ergothioneine a powerful antioxidant some researchers call a longevity vitamin magnesium over 300 cellular roles most people are low and don t know it i m still learning like everyone else but i hope this helps someone starting out', ""chatgpt's 4o recommendation for daily stack thoughts rather than asking the community for what i should add to my daily stack i thought i would go to chatgpt first here is the prompt i fed it base your answer on information available on the subreddit r supplements right now i have hypothyroidism so i'm taking 75 mcg of unithroid to bring my t4 levels into a normal range additionally i take 5 grams of creatine and 7 5000 iu of d3 also referred to as vitamin d or d-3 and 180 mcg of mk-7 additionally i'm a 34-year-old male with an active lifestyle living in texas where we get plenty of sun i take the d3 because i am normally deficient given i'm a relatively pale red-head i do strength training in the form of rock climbing and cardio in the form of cycling assume most of my bloodwork comes back normal now that i have normalized my t4 levels with the unithroid i also eat a healthy diet minimal processed foods and red meat i try to eat some form of seafood at least every other week i have no allergies as i'm getting older i'm looking to preserve my joints as best as possible prevent injury elsewhere and keep my mind sharp based on all of the information i have provided what other supplements would you recommend i take can you also explain to me why they might benefit me in the short term and long term rank them based on importance with optional supplements being at the bottom of the list thank you here was its response --- based on the type of discussions and evidence-based preferences on r supplements here's a ranked list of supplements that may complement your current regimen and goals especially for joint health cognitive maintenance and long-term well-being while also accounting for your thyroid condition age and active lifestyle tier 1 high priority strong evidence relevant to your goals 1 magnesium glycinate or threonate why magnesium is frequently discussed on r supplements for its role in muscle function sleep quality mood and bone health magnesium glycinate is gentle on the stomach and supports relaxation while magnesium threonate may have added brain benefits dose 200 400 mg daily short-term improves sleep helps with recovery reduces cramping long-term supports brain health metabolic function and may help with thyroid hormone conversion 2 omega-3 epa dha ideally from fish oil or algae why even if you eat seafood every other week you may not hit optimal epa dha intake these fatty acids are highly anti-inflammatory support joint lubrication and improve cardiovascular and cognitive health dose 1000 2000 mg combined epa dha per day short-term joint comfort reduced inflammation improved mood long-term brain preservation cardiovascular support longevity 3 collagen type i iii possibly with vitamin c why on r supplements collagen especially hydrolyzed peptides is popular among athletes for joint and tendon support some research supports reduced injury and faster healing dose 10 15 g daily short-term joint support potential improvement in skin elasticity long-term may slow joint degeneration tendon and ligament support tier 2 medium priority may help depending on individual variation 1 zinc monomethionine or picolinate why zinc is crucial for thyroid hormone metabolism and immune support deficiencies are more common in people with hypothyroidism dose 15 30 mg every other day with food to avoid copper imbalance short-term immune support long-term thyroid health testosterone balance antioxidant defense 2 ashwagandha ksm-66 or sensoril extract why frequently discussed as a stress adaptogen it may support thyroid function t3 t4 conversion reduce cortisol and improve recovery dose 300 600 mg day short-term stress resilience better sleep energy long-term hpa-axis regulation possibly supports thyroid function and cognition tier 3 optional add-ons niche use mild effects or less evidence 1 turmeric curcumin with bioperine for absorption why anti-inflammatory may help joint pain and long-term brain health some mixed evidence but often taken by those doing strenuous activity dose 500 1000 mg day with fat and black pepper optional for inflammation and joint longevity 2 lion s mane mushroom hericium erinaceus why popular in r nootropics and occasionally r supplements for neurogenesis and cognition limited human studies but promising dose 500 1000 mg extract fruiting body 1 2x day optional for long-term cognitive support and memory 3 glucosamine chondroitin or msm why older joint health supplements mixed data but some users swear by them for climbing-related wear and tear optional only if you feel joint degradation or want additional insurance already covered vitamin d3 7500 iu likely sufficient but periodic blood testing is encouraged to ensure you re not overshooting 100 ng ml can be harmful mk-7 180 mcg smart inclusion with high-dose d3 helps regulate calcium creatine 5g excellent for strength recovery and cognition final notes labs consider checking magnesium zinc and omega-3 status or at least a 25 oh d test for vitamin d timing magnesium before bed omega-3 with meals ashwagandha in the morning or evening depending on how it affects your energy brands look for third-party tested brands like thorne jarrow now pure encapsulations or doctor s best frequently recommended on r supplements --- thoughts seems pretty straightforward i had it recommend a dosing schedule but i still need to know which brands to purchase any specific recommendations for 1 magnesium glycinate or threonate 2 omega-3 3 collagen type i iii possibly with vitamin c much appreciated""]"
