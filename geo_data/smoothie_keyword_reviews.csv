ChIJVUDRhwQKkEcRBS11mCXWVSc,Patrick,5,a week ago,"The smoothie was perfect. They make their own almond milk in house for the smoothies. The cold Pressed juices are fresh and have the dates on them that they were made, and they're bottled in glass bottles."
ChIJg8Fl8AuhmkcR1tjF-xn5Zog,Xavier,5,3 months ago,"Really nice & cute place! Love the Flat White, the Juices (try the ‚ÄûJust Greens‚Äú!)
I appreciate the place because they also serve smoothies with proteins üôå"
ChIJg8Fl8AuhmkcR1tjF-xn5Zog,Pam Fetzer,5,2 weeks ago,"My favorite place in the center of town to grab a quick matcha, fresh juice, or smoothie! The products are super high quality and the staff are very kind and welcoming."
ChIJg8Fl8AuhmkcR1tjF-xn5Zog,Sophia Hunziker,3,a month ago,"Really nice workers and great aesthetic decor, but the smoothie was lacking sadly. The collagen/protein taste was way too overpowering and the price is 15.- cannot be justified considering that it is just fruit with some collagen/protein powder‚Ä¶"
ChIJg8Fl8AuhmkcR1tjF-xn5Zog,Zischtigs Club,5,3 months ago,Finally a good juice/smoothie bar in the center of zurich and then right next to Bellevue. That's what was really missing. The smoothie was great and the juices were fresh and delicious. I will be back - it is a lifestyle!
ChIJW-eeB44LkEcR8hTnii7jt8U,Sergi videbook,5,2 months ago,"Visiting Dabo Smoothies was a total surprise. I had walked past it so many times without really paying attention, and never thought about going in‚Ä¶ until now. And what a discovery!

From the moment I stepped in, the atmosphere won me over ‚Äî cozy, relaxed, and full of good vibes. The food was just as impressive: everything I tried was delicious, fresh, and, best of all, healthy. You can really tell they put care into everything they make.

Plus, it‚Äôs just around the corner from my house, so I‚Äôll definitely be stopping by often. I‚Äôm really glad I decided to give it a try. Highly recommended."
ChIJncjoIRyhmkcRYLPMfGGWep8,behy yavi,5,a month ago,"The Space:
Spacious sitting area, friendly people working there.
The Food:
In Joe & The Juice: When Tuna Fish meets Avocado, they blend into a deliciously grilled sandwich which they have creatively named: ‚ÄòTunacado‚Äô! Has a good texture, unlike 99% of tuna sandwiches, this one actually tastes well. And, most importantly: You could have their ‚ÄòPick me Up‚Äô smoothie, which does not chemically collide with it! Kidding: Their combination suits your gut and gives it the good feeling it needsüòÇ!
&
That‚Äôs like a good Dane tale, and that I‚Äôd tell!
Unwrap the sandwich, and you‚Äôd find join therein!"
ChIJncjoIRyhmkcRYLPMfGGWep8,Katie Doble,2,a month ago,"We were so excited to see a√ßa√≠ bowls on the menu and added protein powder as it was an option. The a√ßa√≠ was rock solid and the powder was dumped on top vs blended in. When I complained that the bowl wasn‚Äôt edible and the powder wasn‚Äôt blended in, I got a blank stare, like ‚Äúwhat did you expect.‚Äù Super disappointing. Especially given the price $$$. My sister got a smoothie and liked it."
ChIJXQZC1wYLkEcRYMBNvRP782A,Loukpad Bansit,4,3 years ago,"#Wheelchair #accessible nice and quick smoothie and friendly for my mom.
If you are looking for toilet where wheelchair accessible and convenience to take care elderly. Just stop here and hide away from a hot day."
ChIJt2--ZwALkEcRd7Cv_csTI-Q,Dilexshan S,4,2 months ago,"Oakberry is a great place to enjoy healthy, vitamin-rich food and drinks. The atmosphere is modern and inviting, perfect for a quick, nutritious break.

They offer a variety of a√ßa√≠ bowls and smoothies with fresh, high-quality ingredients. While the menu is limited, the options are well-curated and satisfying.

Conveniently located near Jelmoli in Zurich, it‚Äôs a great spot for anyone looking to grab something healthy on the go. Highly recommended!"
ChIJt2--ZwALkEcRd7Cv_csTI-Q,Shiami Thayalakumar,5,a month ago,"Refreshing smoothies and a cozy vibe!‚Äù
I visited Oakberry Zurich this afternoon and had a really nice experience. It wasn‚Äôt too busy, so we got our smoothies quickly ‚Äî and they were delicious! We really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. There are enough tables and cozy spots to sit back and enjoy your snack.

The staff were super friendly and cheerful, always ready to help with a smile, which made the visit even better. The only thing that could be improved is the overall tidiness ‚Äî a quick cleanup of the seating area would make it feel even more inviting.

Overall, a lovely place for a healthy treat in the city. I‚Äôd definitely come back!"
ChIJ7bNpWHinmkcRZrmpJAVsiXo,Yana,4,a year ago,"Place with juicy sandwiches, heathy drinks and amazing carrot cake. Also the friendly stuff.

BUT!

Cleanness is 3.

Almost every table has crumbs and drops of coffeeü§Ø

About prices:
Carrot cake ( my highly recommendation)
Matcha vanilla latte
Tunacado sandwich
Smoothie
Total : 38CHF"
ChIJwQ1KqTULkEcRBMoXYcxNTnI,Martyna Malek,5,a month ago,"The best toasts, elixirs, smoothies in the world. There are no other competitors that could even reach this level of awesomeness. And it's super pretty and healthy at the same time ü•∞

And now I have a new addiction, thank you very much üòÄ"
ChIJUYM_LP2nmkcRM0IngOcOGt0,Iker S√°ez,2,a week ago,"I said my name is Iker (not a common name, I know) but the guy called me ‚ÄúIgor‚Äù when my order was ready, even if it‚Äôs close, it‚Äôs not my name and you cannot be mad at me for not coming for the food‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve ordered in many places and it never happened to me before. He was clearly in a bad mood. But it‚Äôs ok, unfriendly service you find quite commonly in these places (pok√© bowls, bubble tea, smoothies‚Ä¶) so not surprised.

The problem was more that I had to wait almost 25 min. for an avocado toast and a gazpacho, even someone else who arrived afterwards got his order before me.

The gazpacho was not cold and had like a sweet taste, and well, 14‚Äô90 for a piece of bread with avocado and little bit of chili flakes in top? I don‚Äôt know how the bowls are, but the gazpacho and toast were truly disappointing‚Ä¶"
ChIJM46qPq8LkEcR4fz7gUM0DkE,M C,5,a month ago,"One of the best smoothies I have ever had, The Skinny.. was so damn good!

My husband got the tikka masala and it was one of the best curries I've ever had. We both loved it!

I had the rhubarb and yogurt waffles and wow.. they were delectable. Every bite was a treat.

The staff was very friendly and the space was super comfortable. Easy to have a chat and plenty of space to spread out.

I wish I lived here so I could try everything else on the menu as well.

This place is a gem and I'm sure the other locations are nice as well.

Until next time xx!"
ChIJyzgnvGYLkEcRUzJfp7FC_Nw,Anna,5,3 years ago,"I just found this cafe accidentally and I love it. They have good juice/smoothie and healthy food which I want to try next time. I ordered berry juice which is tasty and gives me good energy. The staff are nice. Also, they have outlets, so you can work from this cafe. It's kinda popular so it may not be easy to find a seat but give it a shot."
ChIJP2jEKhIKkEcR4uTulGr_Y-U,Mariana,5,6 years ago,"Lovely little place! This organic juice bar have also a selection of smoothies, bowl and snack as well as a delicious and comforting Matcha latte. It's a great place to spend some time with a book or chatting with a friend. The barista was very kind and all the decorations were so well thought out. Loved it and will come back soon!"
ChIJP2jEKhIKkEcR4uTulGr_Y-U,Ellen Schoenmaker,5,8 years ago,"A really lovely juice bar with simple sandwiches. I had the pesto-brie-arugula sandwich and it was really good, along with the Hakuna Matata green smoothie."
