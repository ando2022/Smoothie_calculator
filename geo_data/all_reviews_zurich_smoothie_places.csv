ChIJVUDRhwQKkEcRBS11mCXWVSc,Giorgia Cappellotto,4,3 weeks ago,The food is amazing and extremely fresh: simple and unrefined ingredients every day for a perfect bowl or bagel! I do recommend to try everything whenever you want something healthy and easy to digest.,Juicery 21,"Sihlstrasse 93, Z√ºrich"
ChIJVUDRhwQKkEcRBS11mCXWVSc,D Briez,5,2 months ago,"I asked lots of questions.  Juices are not pastured, made fresh daily in the downstairs kitchen.  Oats on the granola are certified gluten free.  Lots of gluten free option. Very nice about answer questions and showed price in quality. They speak English's well.  I tried the quinoa bowl with added avocado and egg.  It was perfect. So fresh and delicious.  I also had the green juice and orange juice.  Both great.  As soon as I'm done eating, I will purchase a few things to take back to the Airbnb for later!  What a great tiny little find!  Love supporting places like this. ‚ô•Ô∏è",Juicery 21,"Sihlstrasse 93, Z√ºrich"
ChIJVUDRhwQKkEcRBS11mCXWVSc,Patrick,5,a week ago,"The smoothie was perfect. They make their own almond milk in house for the smoothies. The cold Pressed juices are fresh and have the dates on them that they were made, and they're bottled in glass bottles.",Juicery 21,"Sihlstrasse 93, Z√ºrich"

ChIJVUDRhwQKkEcRBS11mCXWVSc,Tim S,4,5 months ago,"Really Nice Caf√©! (or juicery!) I really liked the vibe! Even thought it was cold it felt like a nice spring afternoon. Whenstaff was very friendly and we got our order quite fast.

We ordered a flat white which was nice and above average and one of the shakes. This one though was much on the milky side. Just from being there and being able to see how they make it I expected a bit of a tastier shake. You could almost not taste any fruit!

Nevertheless it was nice and we will most probably be back some day if we walk by coincidence and feel like it. Still need to try one of their bagels.",Juicery 21,"Sihlstrasse 93, Z√ºrich"

ChIJg8Fl8AuhmkcR1tjF-xn5Zog,Sophia Hunziker,3,a month ago,"Really nice workers and great aesthetic decor, but the smoothie was lacking sadly. The collagen/protein taste was way too overpowering and the price is 15.- cannot be justified considering that it is just fruit with some collagen/protein powder‚Ä¶",Honest Smoothies,"Torgasse 5, Z√ºrich"
ChIJg8Fl8AuhmkcR1tjF-xn5Zog,R. Stocker,5,3 months ago,"We stopped by and were seriously impressed!

We ordered the Berry Glow and Coconut Cloud, both were incredibly fresh, flavorful, and not overly sweet. However, our kids loved them so much, we barely got a sip ourselves, so have to go back ordering more shakes.

Nice.",Honest Smoothies,"Torgasse 5, Z√ºrich"
ChIJg8Fl8AuhmkcR1tjF-xn5Zog,Zischtigs Club,5,3 months ago,Finally a good juice/smoothie bar in the center of zurich and then right next to Bellevue. That's what was really missing.

My verdict: really tasty sandwiches & yummi juices, served in a nice interior by friendly, English-speaking staff. ü•™ü•§

ChIJW-eeB44LkEcR8hTnii7jt8U,Sergi videbook,5,2 months ago,"Visiting Dabo Smoothies was a total surprise. I had walked past it so many times without really paying attention, and never thought about going in‚Ä¶ until now. And what a discovery!

From the moment I stepped in, the atmosphere won me over ‚Äî cozy, relaxed, and full of good vibes. The food was just as impressive: everything I tried was delicious, fresh, and, best of all, healthy. You can really tell they put care into everything they make.

Plus, it‚Äôs just around the corner from my house, so I‚Äôll definitely be stopping by often. I‚Äôm really glad I decided to give it a try. Highly recommended.",Dabo Smoothies,"Birmensdorferstrasse 285, Wiedikon"
ChIJW-eeB44LkEcR8hTnii7jt8U,Daniel Partida,4,2 months ago,"The a√ßai tastes really good, the place is cutr and the staff is friendly.

Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the portions are very small and the mango inside of the bowl is from a can. These two points makes it worth 4 stars but never 5.

Very impressed on the amount of reviews saying is the best ever, it is good but not the best.",Dabo Smoothies,"Birmensdorferstrasse 285, Wiedikon"
ChIJW-eeB44LkEcR8hTnii7jt8U,Angelita DeCapa,5,a month ago,"Amazing, fresh healthy food and a very friendly, personal, warm vibe, definitely my new hot spot in Zurich.

ChIJncjoIRyhmkcRYLPMfGGWep8,behy yavi,5,a month ago,"The Space:
Spacious sitting area, friendly people working there.
The Food:
In Joe & The Juice: When Tuna Fish meets Avocado, they blend into a deliciously grilled sandwich which they have creatively named: ‚ÄòTunacado‚Äô! Has a good texture, unlike 99% of tuna sandwiches, this one actually tastes well. And, most importantly: You could have their ‚ÄòPick me Up‚Äô smoothie, which does not chemically collide with it! Kidding: Their combination suits your gut and gives it the good feeling it needsüòÇ!

ChIJXQZC1wYLkEcRYMBNvRP782A,Monika Lagnaux,1,a month ago,"It is really, really sad that I have to write this about Joe and the juice. I really love the place and I go there quite often. But today I had a really terrible experience. I have ordered avocado sandwich as I always do and ginger shot too. The bread that is usually thin, toasted and crispy it was nothing like that, if anything it was just warm, with thick slices, that hardly have seen the toaster.  And Joe the juice is known for the bread that is thin and crispy. Of course it was edible, but it was just an ordinary sandwich that anyone can make it at home. Ginger shot that I got it was an apple juice with a hint of ginger in it. I did get the order very fast which surprised me because I usually wait longer for the obvious reasons, because it takes time four the bread to be toasted. But I guess they wanted to speed up the process and get rid of the long queue of people. They were just making these sandwiches as fast as they could. That is absolutely wrong and not what Joe end the juice is about. Everyone who is coming to get sandwiches, salads or juices are expecting to get what they‚Äôre paying for. What a shame.",JOE & THE JUICE,"Sihlstrasse 37, Z√ºrich"

The Power Shake and nutrition-rich juices are my personal favorites, and their cappuccinos, brownies, and muffins are irresistible.

The atmosphere is clean and inviting, which enhances the dining experience. Additionally, the customer service here is good, always friendly and helpful.

We really love the brand and the idea and would highly recommend their juices.

A couple of points of feedback relevant to this particular store. We went on a Saturday afternoon and there was only one girl serving which is clearly not enough given the number of customers. As a result, we had to wait quite a bit because they were understaffed. Secondly, prices are slightly higher than in other countries but I guess that is because it‚Äôs Switzerland? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

ChIJofWCl5cLkEcR4hEbJfrbjMY,Norman Wooding,1,6 months ago,"Disappointing Experience ‚Äì Needs Serious Improvement

The team here operates with zero urgency, making the whole system inefficient. You can wait 10 minutes just for someone to take your order‚Äînot because they‚Äôre busy or there‚Äôs a queue, but because they work sequentially rather than simultaneously. One person takes an order, then makes a sandwich, then slowly moves on to the next. Compare this to any Joe & The Juice in London, where staff handle multiple tasks at once‚Äîthis location should take notes.

Beyond inefficiency, there‚Äôs no sense of pride in the work. The team is busy gossiping, the manager jumps in to chat instead of leading, and at one point, three people were working, yet it still took 10 minutes just to acknowledge a single customer. Watching someone take 20 minutes to slice two tomatoes is baffling.

This isn‚Äôt about complaining‚Äîit‚Äôs about improvement. Skip the generic ‚Äúwe care‚Äù response and actually train your staff properly. Faster service, better multitasking, and some basic professionalism would make a world of difference.",JOE & THE JUICE,"Beethovenstrasse 33, Z√ºrich"

The chai latte with pea milk was absolutely delicious! My non-gluten-free friends loved the wide selection of healthy dishes, so for them, it was a great spot.

Unfortunately, the staff wasn‚Äôt very knowledgeable about gluten-free options, had to look things up, and service was quite slow. The long wait time might have been due to the large crowd, which suggests this place has a loyal following.

Don't expect to find a wide selection of produce, it's just a fallback for when you are really on the go or everything else is closed.
